Citizen scientists undertook a one-day training program, which addressed data collection skills and academic topics in the national science curriculum. A subset of teachers and corporate sponsor staff participated in an intensive multi-day training program with researchers before venturing into the field.Data collected by citizen scientists were compared with data collected by researchers at nearby locations. We found the citizen science data were of equivalent quality to those collected by researchers, but there were differences among students. Primary school students detected more debris than did older \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11790121245650704996", "cites_id": ["11790121245650704996"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716302063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZNrLYc7snqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 19, "2019": 19, "2020": 18, "2021": 29, "2022": 31, "2023": 9}}
