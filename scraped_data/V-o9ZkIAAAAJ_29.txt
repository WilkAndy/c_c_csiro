We use a bio\u2010economic approach to demonstrate that compensatory mitigation \u2013 an innovative, market\u2010influenced approach to fishery\u2013conservation conflicts \u2013 can facilitate high\u2010value uses of biological resources and cost\u2010effective conservation gains for species of concern. We illustrate the strategy with a seabird example: levying fishers for their bycatch and using the funds to remove invasive mammals from breeding islands. Removal of invasive predators is 23 times more effective from a return\u2010on\u2010investment perspective (ie percent increase in population growth per dollar invested) in comparison to fisheries closures, and is more socio\u2010politically feasible. A bycatch levy, which would increase with endangerment, provides an individual incentive for avoiding bycatch, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6692381040149082005", "cites_id": ["6692381040149082005"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[325:CMAAST]2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lS-lJxkd4FwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 12, "2010": 16, "2011": 10, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
