This study reviews 68 publications from 1975 to 2017 that contain quantitative information about fishing gear losses. Gear loss estimates reported by the studies ranged widely, with all net studies reviewed reporting annual gear loss rates from 0% to 79.8%, all trap studies reporting gear loss rates from 0% to 88%, and all line studies reporting gear loss rates from 0.1% to 79.2%. Information obtained from this review was used to perform a meta\u2010analysis that provides the first synthetic, statistically robust estimates of global fishing gear losses. The meta\u2010analysis estimates global fishing gear losses for different major gear types. We estimate that 5.7% of all fishing nets, 8.6% of all traps, and 29% of all lines are lost around \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3718151154007032820", "cites_id": ["3718151154007032820"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12407", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9EPMY8aGmTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 18, "2021": 25, "2022": 56, "2023": 25}}
