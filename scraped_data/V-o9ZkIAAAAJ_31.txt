To improve understanding of the sources and impacts of marine debris, we carried out a national litter survey at 175 sites around Australia using a stratified random sampling approach. Litter from land\u2010 and sea\u2010based sources is ubiquitous, and sampling effects related to coastline shape, substrate characteristics, gradient, and backshore type were highly significant. Source effects related to land\u2010based sources (eg population density and distance to road) were also highly significant. Of the total debris sampled, approximately 75% was plastic; 2% was related to recreational fishing. Litter density significantly increased with proximity to urban areas, suggesting a domestic origin; statistical patterns suggest that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15448436091708382049", "cites_id": ["15448436091708382049"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.1447", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YRuarcbeY9YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 16, "2019": 12, "2020": 17, "2021": 34, "2022": 33, "2023": 12}}
