While there are many studies now addressing this topic, the influence of urbanisation factors such as local population density, stormwater drains and roads on the distribution of coastal litter remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out standardized surveys at 224 transect surveys at 67 sites in two estuaries and along the open coast in Tasmania, Australia. We explored the relative support for three hypotheses regarding the sources of the debris; direct deposition by beachgoers, transport from surrounding areas via storm water drains and coastal runoff, and onshore transport from the marine system. We found strong support for all three mechanisms, however, onshore transport from the marine reservoir was the most important mechanism. Overall, the three models together explained 45.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9306070367875789154", "cites_id": ["9306070367875789154"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44479", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YnEGpLHNJYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 10, "2019": 20, "2020": 29, "2021": 24, "2022": 20, "2023": 12}}
