We studied the life-history of the black-vented shearwater (Puffinus opisthomelas) on Natividad Island, Baja California Sur, Mexico, to examine its vulnerability to introduced feral cats. Using an allometric equation, we estimated that feral cats consumed 328 g of food day-1 to satisfy their nutritional requirements. We used stable isotope analysis of cat scat to estimate that 90% of the cats' diet was composed of shearwaters. Using data from our focal species and from the closely related manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), we created a demographic model to evaluate the effects of cat population size on the annual growth rate (\u03bb) of the shearwater. The annual growth rate for black-vented shearwaters was estimated to be 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3397163085845575389", "cites_id": ["3397163085845575389"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal-conservation-forum/article/effect-of-feral-cats-on-the-population-viability-of-blackvented-shearwaters-puffinus-opisthomelas-on-natividad-island-mexico/119F0975C0C7E9971E140755073D406D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Tbl39MlJS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 9, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
