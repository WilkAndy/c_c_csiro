Humans have a long history of removing predators from ecosystems; current island restoration actions typically focus on the removal of invasive predators, such as non-native rodents, from seabird breeding islands. While not overly abundant, the results of predator removal studies provide valuable information on the demographic response of birds, and can assist conservation practitioners with prioritizing invasive predator removal projects. We review such studies focusing on observed demographic responses of bird populations to predator removal campaigns and whether ecological factors are useful in predicting those responses. From the 800+ predator removal programs indentified, a small fraction (n = 112) reported demographic responses of bird populations. Change in productivity was the most commonly reported response \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16984702783281382151", "cites_id": ["16984702783281382151"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-010-9776-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B0MTTTHJtesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 16, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
