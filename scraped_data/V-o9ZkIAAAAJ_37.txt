Quantifying this threat is particularly difficult and complex, especially when evaluating multiple species with different ecological requirements. Here, we examine the semi-enclosed basin of the Mediterranean Sea where the inputs of plastic pollution and its impact on marine diversity are still widely unknown. Eighty-four species from six taxonomic classes were evaluated to assess the risk of ingesting plastic marine debris, integrating inter-specific factors such as plastic exposure rates and life history traits (e.g., motility, habitat, and body size). Species were modelled within a spatial context to identify and estimate their exposure to plastic ingestion across the Mediterranean Sea using literature data, species distribution maps and plastic dispersion models. Our approach identified hotspots for the risk of plastic ingestion across multiple taxa in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4672900478795807558", "cites_id": ["4672900478795807558"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719318984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RntgNTp62UAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 18, "2021": 29, "2022": 30, "2023": 20}}
