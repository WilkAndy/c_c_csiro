Marine debris ingestion is a globally recognized threat to marine biodiversity, yet the relationship between how much debris a bird ingests and mortality remains poorly understood. Using cause of death data from 1733 seabirds of 51 species, we demonstrate a significant relationship between ingested debris and a debris-ingestion cause of death (dose-response). There is a 20.4% chance of lifetime mortality from ingesting a single debris item, rising to 100% after consuming 93 items. Obstruction of the gastro-intestinal tract is the leading cause of death. Overall, balloons are the highest-risk debris item; 32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic. These findings have significant implications for quantifying seabird mortality due to debris ingestion, and provide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7943294414913578963", "cites_id": ["7943294414913578963"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/%20S41598-018-36585-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:06dEWy9APG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 9, "2020": 22, "2021": 28, "2022": 33, "2023": 10}}
