Although a large number of empirical studies provide emerging evidence of impacts to wildlife, there has been little systematic assessment of risk. We performed a spatial risk analysis using predicted debris distributions and ranges for 186 seabird species to model debris exposure. We adjusted the model using published data on plastic ingestion by seabirds. Eighty of 135 (59%) species with studies reported in the literature between 1962 and 2012 had ingested plastic, and, within those studies, on average 29% of individuals had plastic in their gut. Standardizing the data for time and species, we estimate the ingestion rate would reach 90% of individuals if these studies were conducted today. Using these results from the literature, we tuned our risk model and were able to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 911, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11990432001913730756", "cites_id": ["11990432001913730756"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1502108112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xDaLsWCSZqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 34, "2017": 63, "2018": 110, "2019": 126, "2020": 164, "2021": 152, "2022": 162, "2023": 71}}
