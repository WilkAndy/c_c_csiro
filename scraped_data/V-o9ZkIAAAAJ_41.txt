Container deposit legislation (CDL) is one of the many legislative actions proposed by lawmakers to curb the amount of debris entering the ocean. Beverage containers are consistently among the most commonly littered items, so effective legislation could prove a significant lever to reduce debris inputs to the marine environment. The effectiveness of CDL at reducing the amount of beverage container litter on the coasts of two countries, Australia and the United States, was evaluated by comparing results of debris surveys in states with and without cash incentives for returned beverage containers. The proportion of containers found in coastal debris surveys in states with CDL was approximately 40% lower than in states without CDL. Additionally, CDL states had a higher ratio of lids to bottles, further \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1829772236793856017", "cites_id": ["1829772236793856017"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EUD4oSeoZBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 17, "2021": 21, "2022": 31, "2023": 9}}
