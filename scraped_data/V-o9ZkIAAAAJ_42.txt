Complete eradication of the predator, although desirable, may be elusive in budget\u2010limited situations, whereas predator suppression is more feasible and may still achieve conservation goals. We used a stochastic predator\u2013prey model based on a Lotka\u2010Volterra system to investigate the cost\u2010effectiveness of predator control to achieve prey conservation. We compared five control strategies: immediate eradication, removal of a constant number of predators (fixed\u2010number control), removal of a constant proportion of predators (fixed\u2010rate control), removal of predators that exceed a predetermined threshold (upper\u2010trigger harvest), and removal of predators whenever their population falls below a lower predetermined threshold (lower\u2010trigger harvest).
