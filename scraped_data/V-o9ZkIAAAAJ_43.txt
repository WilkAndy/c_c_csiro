Given that goal we face a decision: how much effort should we invest in quarantine to reduce the risk of a pest arriving vs. surveillance, looking for the pest on the island with the view of eradicating it before it gets out of control. We use models of an island under threat of invasion by a pest (animal, plant or disease) and a cost minimisation approach to optimally allocate management resources between quarantine and surveillance. In the optimal allocations joint investment in both quarantine and surveillance is uncommon. Investment in quarantine is optimal if quarantine is more effective than surveillance or if large costs associated with pest impact and eradication are incurred at low pest density. Investment in quarantine is also favoured as our ability to eradicate a pest declines. Surveillance is optimal if it is considerably \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12765036880366368609", "cites_id": ["12765036880366368609"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000200", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YXf_HmmFJrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
