Strategies that meet a stock conservation criterion under a base case scenario are subjected to a set of robustness trials, including biased and highly variable abundance estimates and poaching. Strategy performance is assessed with respect to a conservation criterion, the revenues achieved and their variability. Strategies that harvest heavily, even when the population is apparently very large, perform badly in the robustness trials. Setting a threshold below which harvesting does not take place, and above which all individuals are harvested, does not provide effective protection against over-harvesting. Strategies that rely on population growth rates rather than estimates of population size are more robust to biased estimates. The strategies that are most robust to uncertainty are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16323331227110622398", "cites_id": ["16323331227110622398"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal-conservation-forum/article/competing-harvesting-strategies-in-a-simulated-population-under-uncertainty/C8AD19AF7B26304A595C5A9D626E2CC8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vkT4LkQfiOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
