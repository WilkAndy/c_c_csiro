Quantitative analysis of spatial management options in particular is complicated, as information on spatial fleet and stock dynamics is often unavailable and spatial models are difficult to construct. In this paper, a qualitative framework is presented that aids in the analysis of alternative spatial management options in coastal fisheries. The framework combines expert opinion and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine which options perform best taking into account the multiple objectives inherent in fisheries management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14325753933033678373", "cites_id": ["14325753933033678373"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569108001397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JaYgDk1Nz8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
