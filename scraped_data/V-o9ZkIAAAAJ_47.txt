However, empirical evidence indicates many metapopulations are driven by habitat succession and disturbance. We develop a stochastic metapopulation model, incorporating habitat disturbance and recovery, coupled with patch colonization and extinction, to investigate the effect of habitat dynamics on persistence. We discover that habitat dynamics play a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics. The mean number of suitable habitat patches is not adequate for characterizing the dynamics of the metapopulation. For a fixed mean number of suitable patches, we discover that the details of how disturbance affects patches and how patches recover influences metapopulation dynamics in a fundamental way. Moreover, metapopulation persistence is dependent not only on the average lifetime of a patch, but also on the variance in patch lifetime and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3706251588339031185", "cites_id": ["3706251588339031185"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/05-0587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kdws2y5AbzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 14, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
