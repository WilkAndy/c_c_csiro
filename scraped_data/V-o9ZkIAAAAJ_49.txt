While much of the bycatch problem is technological in nature due to imperfect selectivity of the fishing gear, fisher behaviour also plays a major role. How, when and where fishers choose to fish can influence catch composition and thereby the quantity of bycatch. Behavioural changes can be encouraged through the development of an appropriate set of incentives\u2014both economic and social\u2014to avoid bycatch and reduce discarding. In this paper, a number of alternative incentive-based bycatch management systems are reviewed. The potential applicability of these systems to quota species, non-commercial species and threatened or conservationdependent species (such as turtles, seals, dolphins) is reviewed, and examples of their application are presented. The review concludes that incentive-based approaches can reduce the level of bycatch and discarding in most fisheries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9377043635857182166", "cites_id": ["9377043635857182166"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42584746/Use_of_Incentive-Based_Management_System20160211-21005-6hmetq.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1s2aToHzIYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
