Plastic production is increasing exponentially and causing an unprecedented growth of plastic pollution entering the marine environment. Hence, a thorough assessment of debris accumulation areas is required to address the longstanding question about where is all the missing plastic. Most research on marine debris sinks to date has focused on oceanic gyres, the water column, seabeds and wildlife. Relatively little has focused on the potential of coastal areas as debris sinks. To address this knowledge gap, the spatial distribution of debris from the waterline to the backshore was modelled from a continental-scale dataset of coastal debris distribution from 635 surveys across Australia. Results showed that the distribution of debris is significantly correlated with oceanic and atmospheric processes (ie onshore Stokes drift and wind), and coastal usage for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9571229125638704915", "cites_id": ["9571229125638704915"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7836/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E0-R4S3W04QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 14, "2021": 23, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
