We consider how metapopulation persistence is affected by different disturbance regimes and the way in which disturbances spread, when metapopulations are compact or elongated, using a stochastic spatially explicit model which includes metapopulation and habitat dynamics. We discover that the risk of population extinction is larger for spatially aggregated disturbances than for spatially random disturbances. By changing the spatial configuration of the patches in the system\u2014leading to different proportions of edge and interior patches\u2014we demonstrate that the probability of metapopulation extinction is smaller when the metapopulation is more compact. Both of these results become more pronounced when colonization connectivity decreases. Our results have important management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17523654120102437", "cites_id": ["17523654120102437"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580906001614", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jdr-qqtBPgAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 11, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
