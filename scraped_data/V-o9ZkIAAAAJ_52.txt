The western tussock moth Orgyia vetusta, a defoliator with flightless adult females, forms localized outbreaks within larger areas of its habitat. These outbreaks may persist for several (> 10) years with little tendency to spread. 2. According to reaction-diffusion models, spatial patterns in population density may arise from the interaction between a mobile predator and a less-mobile prey. This occurs because predators `spill over' around the edges of prey populations, creating zones in which ratios of predators to prey are elevated. 3. To test this `predator diffusion' hypothesis for tussock moths, we placed their eggs and larvae along a 500-m transect leading away from the edge of a tussock moth outbreak, through suitable but sparsely occupied habitat. We measured attack rates by a wasp egg parasitoid and four species of tachinid fly larval-to-pupal parasitoids on these experimental immature moths. 4.
