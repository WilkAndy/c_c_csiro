Spending those dollars effectively and efficiently is of pivotal importance (Wilson et al., 2006). Martins et al.(2006) present an analysis of economic costs of invasive mammal eradications on islands that they claim \u2018provide conservation planners with a robust, if preliminary, estimate of the cost of any proposed eradication programme.\u2019Given that invasive mammal eradication is one society\u2019s most powerful conservation tools, this is a badly needed instrument (Donlan et al., 2003). However, while we commend Martins and colleagues\u2019 efforts and goal, the available data are simply and sadly insufficient to provide such a tool. More importantly, providing a na\u0131ve tool is potentially misleading and dangerous for land managers, conservation practitioners and philanthropists who may turn to the pages of conservation journals for guidance. The costing of eradication campaigns is a complex process. As quantitatively demonstrated by Martins and colleagues, island area plays a major factor in the variation of costs. Using general linear models with a dataset that included 41 eradication campaigns, the authors conclude \u2018decision makers considering potential eradication programmes need only know island area, distance from airport (at least in the New Zealand region), and species to be eradicated to make internally consistent and robust first-pass estimates of likely costs.\u2019In reality, a number of factors and examples strongly suggest that this is not the case. We briefly address five of those issues here. First is the issue of fixed costs. Martins and colleagues claim that due to efficiency gains in the ability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14940123851009219603", "cites_id": ["14940123851009219603"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43081061/Complexities_of_costing_eradications20160225-3067-16o5v2q.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E9y-f3z7Vc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
