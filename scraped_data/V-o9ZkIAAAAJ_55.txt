Most predators do not complete their life cycle in ephemeral aquatic systems, thus colonization processes may have a strong effect on the patterns of predation in these communities. I used an artificial pond experiment and surveys of vertebrate and invertebrate species in a system of natural ephemeral pools to study the effect of habitat size and isolation on the colonization patterns of predatory aquatic insects. Artificial pond experiments demonstrated that the two main predatory aquatic insect taxa in ponds were affected by the size and isolation of the pond from semipermanent wetlands. The effect of pond size was nonlinear, fitting a saturating function with size, and it interacted with isolation in determining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16426659005728123628", "cites_id": ["16426659005728123628"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1560/92B4-15TH-U7WM-LLTW", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7GrlYlU39-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
