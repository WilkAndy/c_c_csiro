Much of the crew was ill with scurvy. A highborn Tahitian who assisted with their treatment was later presented with a \u201ccat in litter\u201d as a gesture of thanks (Salmond 2003)\u2014a nice idea, but one in a parade of \u201cintroductions\u201d of non-native species. Two years later, Captain James Cook followed on Endeavour, which was loaded with \u201ccattle, sheep, goats, chickens, ducks in pens, while dogs and cats ran underfoot and rats and cockroaches swarmed throughout the vessel\u201d(Salmond 2003). Much of the livestock was also donated to locals or released onto islands throughout the Pacific. By 1777, Cook\u2019s ship Resolution was likened to a floating menagerie of \u201ccattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, turkeys, geese, ducks and peafowl,\u201d some of which were destined for deliberate release as alternative food sources for M\u0101ori in New Zealand (Salmond 2003). Benjamin Franklin similarly wished to \u201cconvey the conveniences of life, as fowls, hogs, goats, cattle, corn, iron, &c., to those remote regions which are destitute of them, by personally delivering such items to the South Seas\u201d(Strauss 1963). These gentlemen scientists could not have dreamed that their benign intentions would ultimately result in widespread damage to native ecosystems. Plants and animals were certainly spread beyond their natural range well before the voyages of eighteenth century explorers, but Cook\u2019s releases were meticulously recorded, largely deliberate, and sanctioned by the Royal Society. This trickle of exotic species released onto islands, and supported by scientific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1035382017387392533", "cites_id": ["1035382017387392533"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G-Byrd-2/publication/281527335_Impacts_of_Introduced_Predators_on_Seabirds/links/630580581ddd44702104d817/Impacts-of-Introduced-Predators-on-Seabirds.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fe4ziXVqXg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 3, "2021": 10, "2022": 4}}
