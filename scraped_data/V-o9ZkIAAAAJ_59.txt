Such \u2018ghost nets\u2019 cause the by-catch of marine fauna and require retrieval from coastlines where they wash up. Identifying the causes of discarded nets and feasible intervention points requires analysis of a complex value chain and the stakeholders within it, yet no studies have attempted this. In this paper we combine Value Chain Analysis, commonly applied to understand value-adding for a commodity, with elements of Life Cycle Assessment and social network analysis to examine the drivers, stakeholders, economic, environmental and social costs and benefits in the life of a trawl net. We use the Arafura Sea as a case study, which is shared by Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, and is the focus of a Trans-boundary Diagnostic Assessment (TDA) within the Arafura \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6832807176683668865", "cites_id": ["6832807176683668865"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479713001606", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gUX46OwB014J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
