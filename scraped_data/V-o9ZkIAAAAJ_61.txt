However, when debris is washed ashore or locally deposited, it may be washed away before it is removed or recorded. Using statistical models to understand the movement of debris in coastal processes may identify potential sinks of anthropogenic debris. We modelled arrival and departure of debris using data from repeated removal and marking experiments. Both the arrival and departure of debris were affected by the substrate of the shoreline and by seasonal changes (e.g. autumn and winter). Different substrates accumulated different types of debris. The backshore, coastal shape and wind exposure had all affected the departure but not the arrival of debris. Our findings suggest that areas with high accumulation have lower departure, rather than higher arrival of debris.
