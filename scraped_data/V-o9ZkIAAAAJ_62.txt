Current theory does not allow for temporal variation in habitat quality, a serious limitation when confronted with real ecological systems. We develop both a stochastic equivalent of the ideal free distribution to study how spatial patterns of habitat use depend on the magnitude and spatial correlation of environmental stochasticity and also a stochastic habitat selection rule. The emerging patterns are confronted with deterministic predictions based on isodar analysis, an established empirical approach to the analysis of habitat selection patterns. Our simulations highlight some consistent patterns of habitat use, indicating that it is possible to make \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1263181560870472968", "cites_id": ["1263181560870472968"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/424532", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CA2C3u-4hxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
