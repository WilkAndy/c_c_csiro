Birds in particular mistake plastic for prey, and millions of wild birds carry small plastic loads in their stomach and are exposed to potential toxicological effects. It is currently unknown how severely the toxicological and endocrine disrupting chemicals in plastic affect avian development, reproduction and endocrine function. To address this question, we conducted multi-generational plastic feeding experiments to test the toxicological consequences of plastic ingestion at environmentally relevant loads in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, investigating parental and two filial generations. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of lasting toxicological effects on mortality, adult body weight, organ histology, hormone levels, fertility, hatch rates and eggshell strength in birds experimentally fed plastic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11640029987480146889", "cites_id": ["11640029987480146889"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719306722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yROmIpqxiaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 24, "2023": 8}}
