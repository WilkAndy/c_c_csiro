We examined the incidence and ecological factors associated with marine debris ingestion in Procellariiformes by examining seabirds collected at a global seabird hotspot, the Australasian-Southern Ocean boundary. We examined marine debris ingestion trends in 1734 individuals of 51 Procellariform species, finding significant variation in the incidence of marine debris abundance among species. Variation in the incidence of marine debris ingestion between species was influenced by the taxonomy, foraging ecology, diet, and foraging range overlaps with oceanic regions polluted with marine debris. Among the ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion variability in Procellariiformes, we demonstrate that the combination of taxonomy, foraging method, diet, and exposure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13082872267785144085", "cites_id": ["13082872267785144085"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-018-37324-w.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FYck8wKzj7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
