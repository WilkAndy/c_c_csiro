However, their establishment can involve substantial social conflict and may not produce the anticipated biological and economic benefits. A crucial factor associated with the success of marine reserves for enhancing fisheries and protecting biodiversity is the spatial distribution of fishing activity. Fishers may be attracted to the perimeter of a reserve in expectation of spillover of adult fishes. This concentration of effort can reduce \u201cspillover\u201d of fish to the surrounding fishery and has major implications for the effectiveness of reserves in achieving ecological and socioeconomic goals. We examined the spatial distribution of fishing activity relative to California's Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve and found no aggregation near the reserve. We discuss the factors driving the spatial distribution of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8281624969169939266", "cites_id": ["8281624969169939266"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023%3C0241:DCFAAM%3E2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QithEgg-7nIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
