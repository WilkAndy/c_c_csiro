We develop a state\u2010dependent decision\u2010making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8620099766953851622", "cites_id": ["8620099766953851622"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00422.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5jq2GRG_oHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
