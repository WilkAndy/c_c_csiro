In diving marine predators, the number of dives within a dive bout, distances between dives in a bout and distances between bouts have been related to prey patch size, density of prey patches and prey encounter rates, respectively. In addition, the predictability of prey encounters can be examined by studying individuals' foraging site fidelity. Based on this, we examined in chick-rearing Masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) from Phillip Island (South-west Pacific), Australia, using GPS and depth\u2013acceleration data logger, how these parameters changed over time (two early breeding phases and one late phase over two years) and according to foraging locations and environmental conditions. Results revealed that birds foraged in two distinct areas: over a nearby shallow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9978239793532529427", "cites_id": ["9978239793532529427"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098114003001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E2ssqTnUeYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
