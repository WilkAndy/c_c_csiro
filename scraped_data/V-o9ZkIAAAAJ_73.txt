These beds were deposited by large and infrequent flows in a low-relief basin plain. An almost complete lack of bed amalgamation aids bed correlation, and resembles some modern abyssal plains, but contrasts with ubiquitous bed amalgamation seen in fan-lobe deposits worldwide. Despite the subdued topography of this basin plain, the beds have a complicated character. Previous work showed that a single flow can commonly comprise both turbidity current and cohesive mud-rich debris flows. The debris flows were highly mobile on low gradients, but their deposits are absent in outcrops nearest to source. Similar hybrid beds have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17118647786254790277", "cites_id": ["17118647786254790277"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article-abstract/8/6/1207/132584", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hW6-jnanke0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
