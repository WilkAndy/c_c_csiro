International efforts to catalogue and quantify the density, extent and nature of mismanaged waste have not yet assessed the heterogeneity of debris between nearby areas. Better understanding of how debris types and density can be used as a proxy between regions and between land and seafloor habitats at a global scale can aid in developing cost effective and representative debris monitoring systems. Using volunteer collected clean-up and survey data, we compared the proportion and density of both total debris and specific items across 19,428 coastal land and seafloor sites from International Coastal Cleanups and Dive Against Debris surveys, from 86 countries between 2011 and 2018. We show that although some items common on land \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7779056119135149230", "cites_id": ["7779056119135149230"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120302141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rhzhPFPC9GsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 15, "2022": 12, "2023": 8}}
