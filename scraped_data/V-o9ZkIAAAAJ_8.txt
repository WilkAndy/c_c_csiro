One threat in particular that has emerged over the last 4 decades is the pollution of oceanic and coastal habitats with plastic debris. The increased occurrence of plastics in marine ecosystems mirrors the increased prevalence of plastics in society, and reflects the high durability and persistence of plastics in the environment. In an effort to guide future research and assist mitigation approaches to marine conservation, we have generated a list of 16 priority research questions based on the expert opinions of 26 researchers from around the world, whose research expertise spans several disciplines, and covers each of the world\u2019s oceans and the taxa most at risk from plastic pollution. This paper highlights a growing concern related to threats posed to marine \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 364, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12086262866487797681", "cites_id": ["12086262866487797681"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v25/n3/p225-247/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sef_kgoIu6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 15, "2016": 33, "2017": 31, "2018": 43, "2019": 57, "2020": 51, "2021": 60, "2022": 50, "2023": 14}}
