We found that the disappearance rates of experimentally placed larvae and pupae were consistently lower in the outbreak area than in non-outbreak areas. For pupae but not larvae, this difference was removed by using tanglefoot to repel nonflying predators. However, the major nonflying predator of pupae, the ant Formica lasioides, was no more abundant in non-outbreak areas than in the outbreak area. We found inverse density-dependence in the rate of attack by F. lasioides on experimental pupae, suggesting this generalist predator is \"satiated\" within the outbreak area, but preys more heavily on the moth where the moth is sparse."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14321026947333686838", "cites_id": ["14321026947333686838"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/4220889", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ngaf7iGCvsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
