We develop a conceptual model which applies this approach to the mitigation of marine megafauna by\u2010catch in fisheries, going from defining an overarching goal with an associated quantitative target, through avoidance, minimization, remediation to offsetting. We demonstrate the framework's utility as a tool for structuring thinking and exposing uncertainties. We draw comparisons between debates ongoing in terrestrial situations and in by\u2010catch mitigation, to show how insights from each could inform the other; these are the hierarchical nature of mitigation, out\u2010of\u2010kind offsets, research as an offset, incentivizing implementation of mitigation measures, societal limits and uncertainty. We explore how economic incentives could be used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15147279170661859533", "cites_id": ["15147279170661859533"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zUD56CbyNdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 12, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
