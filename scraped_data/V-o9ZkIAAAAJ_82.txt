Estimates of the amount of ALDFG entering the ocean have implications for managers and policy makers as they work to tailor solutions at scale. While scientists have worked since the 1970s to develop quantitatively rigorous estimates for ALDFG, the estimate that 640,000 tonnes of ALDFG enters the ocean annually has been repeatedly and erroneously cited for over a decade. We trace the history of this misinformation and discuss the implications of the perpetuation of this estimate. We also discuss major challenges around the creation of statistically robust global ALDFG estimates, and present opportunities to refine and improve estimates of lost fishing gear."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11496892690876229651", "cites_id": ["11496892690876229651"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X21001330", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E2h2PP0qjZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 14, "2023": 12}}
