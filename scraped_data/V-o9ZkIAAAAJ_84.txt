There has been increasing recognition that catastrophes are an important factor in modelling threatened populations. However, density dependence has generally been omitted from models of threatened populations on the assumption that this omission yields conservative predictions. We explore the significance of including density-dependent catastrophes in models of threatened populations. 2. Using an analytical model, we show that density-dependent catastrophes have a significant effect on population persistence, decreasing mean persistence time at large population sizes and causing a relative increase at intermediate sizes. 3. We illustrate our results with empirical data from a disease outbreak in crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus and show that intermediate population sizes have the longest predicted persistence times. 4. The pattern we found is qualitatively different from previous results on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16671679427815110657", "cites_id": ["16671679427815110657"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3505769", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AXgb-Bu0XecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
