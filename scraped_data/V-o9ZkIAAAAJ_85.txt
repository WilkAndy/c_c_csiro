Much evidence now exists that documents island biodiversity impacts by invasive mammals. The technical ability to eradicate invasive mammals from islands has increased exponentially; consequently, strategic planning focused on maximizing the ROI is now a limiting factor for island restoration. We use a regional ROI approach to prioritize eradications on islands for seabird conservation in British Columbia, Canada. We do so by integrating economic costs of interventions and applying a resource allocation approach. We estimate the optimal set of islands for eradication under two conservation objectives each with a series of increasing thresholds of population sizes and breeding locations. Our approach (1) identified the most cost\u2010effective interventions, (2) determined whether or not those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4624229172784841812", "cites_id": ["4624229172784841812"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VMTWs-6PLEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 3}}
