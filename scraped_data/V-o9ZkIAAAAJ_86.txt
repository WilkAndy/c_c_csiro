In the face of limited data, several authors have suggested using diffusion approximations to estimate the mean time to extinction as a means of quantifying the risk of extinction. However, the accuracy of the diffusion approximation for characterizing extinction processes has not been well tested. We develop a simulation model that includes life history parameters and incorporates both demographic and environmental stochasticity in population dynamics. We use the simulation model to study the effects of stochasticity on the accuracy of the diffusion approximation across different life history strategies. Our results show that predictions for mean time to extinction from the diffusion approximation may differ significantly from simulated ones, and that the amount and direction of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7402792701016525209", "cites_id": ["7402792701016525209"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1163:DLHTAT]2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mcnxab0AvGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
