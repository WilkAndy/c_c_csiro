Although researchers have reported on ingestion of anthropogenic debris by marine turtles and implied incidences of debris ingestion have increased over time, there has not been a global synthesis of the phenomenon since 1985. Thus, we analyzed 37 studies published from 1985 to 2012 that report on data collected from before 1900 through 2011. Specifically, we investigated whether ingestion prevalence has changed over time, what types of debris are most commonly ingested, the geographic distribution of debris ingestion by marine turtles relative to global debris distribution, and which species and life\u2010history stages are most likely to ingest debris. The probability of green (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) ingesting debris increased significantly over time, and plastic was the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 344, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11755746945075599162", "cites_id": ["11755746945075599162"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Oled2o_NJKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 19, "2015": 27, "2016": 32, "2017": 35, "2018": 40, "2019": 34, "2020": 45, "2021": 45, "2022": 42, "2023": 13}}
