Marine ecosystems worldwide are affected by human-made refuse, much of which is plastic. The potential impacts of waste mismanagement are broad and deep. Marine debris comes from both land and sea-based sources and can travel immense distances. It can pose a navigation hazard, smother coral reefs, transport invasive species and negatively affect tourism. It also injures and kills wildlife, can transport chemical contaminants and may pose a threat to human health."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5534081019545982226", "cites_id": ["5534081019545982226"], "pub_url": "https://apo.org.au/node/41318", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EhVF0F0BzUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
