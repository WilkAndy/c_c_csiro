Researchers have identified some animal populations that are heavily impacted by marine debris, including several species of turtles in the northern and eastern marine bioregions and seabirds nesting on some offshore islands. Impacts may range result from either ingestion or entanglement, and may result in reduced health, decreased reproductive output and mortality.However, it has remained difficult to develop a synoptic description of the overall threat to ecological systems. This uncertainty is due to three causes: an absence of a national map of the distribution of marine debris, comparative information on exposure of wildlife across taxa and regions, and a clear understanding of the effects of exposure to debris. This project provided an initial step in addressing this uncertainty by identifying available information on debris and developing preliminary analysis of its sources and distribution at a national scale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13497896171577741676", "cites_id": ["13497896171577741676"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/marine-debris-sources.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bBH_mQ0pUrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
