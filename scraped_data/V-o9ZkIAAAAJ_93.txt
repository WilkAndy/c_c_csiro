Understanding patterns of gene flow in these model systems can help us manage species and ecosystems threatened by human impacts. The mound springs of central Australia represent such a natural model ecosystem, supporting a unique aquatic fauna distributed within an inhospitable arid landscape. Moreover, these springs are being impacted by over extraction of groundwater, providing a unique opportunity to look at dispersal in a patchy habitat that is changing. The present study represents the first fine scale analysis of gene flow under different scenarios of habitat connectivity for the endangered mound spring snail, Fonscochlea accepta. Within a single spring group pairwise estimates of F ST between springs were very low (ave 0.015) with no association found \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16118939523392822962", "cites_id": ["16118939523392822962"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-006-9206-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sl7VPxj6sd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
