Data from the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) in the Tasman Sea were used, and the focal species was the flesh-footed shearwater Puffinus carneipes Gould, 1844 (the species most commonly killed in this fishery). Encounters between flesh-footed shearwaters and longline fishing vessels varied with season, distance from Lord Howe Island, and a number of environmental and oceanographic variables. Encounters were most common south-west of Lord Howe Island, in waters associated with the Tasman Front and the East Australian Current. The resulting model was used to predict overlaps between fisheries and flesh-footed shearwaters during 3 years (1997-98, 2003-04 and 2006-07). During 2003-04, high rates of interaction were predicted in areas with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18100040886938732786", "cites_id": ["18100040886938732786"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v447/p231-242/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8ogH3klDMPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
