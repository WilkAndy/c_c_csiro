While this is largely being implemented through Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) other management measures, such as market based instruments (MBIs), have proved to be effective at managing target species catch in fisheries and reducing environmental impacts in industries such as mining and tourism. Market-based management measures aim to mitigate the impacts of activities by better aligning the incentives their participants face with the objectives of management, changing their behavior as a consequence. In this paper, we review the potential of MBIs as management tools to mitigate undesirable environmental impacts associated with commercial fishing. Where they exist, examples of previous applications are described and the factors that influence their applicability and effectiveness are discussed. Several fishing methods and impacts are considered and suggest that whilst no single approach is most appropriate in all circumstances either replacing or complementing existing management arrangements with MBIs has the potential to improve environmental performance. This has a number of implications. From the environmental perspective they should enable levels of undesirable impacts such as damage to sensitive habitat or the bycatch of protected species of turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds to be reduced. The increased flexibility MBIs allow industry when developing solutions also has the potential to reduce costs to both the industry and managers, improving the cost-effectiveness of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3485253178293837973", "cites_id": ["3485253178293837973"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2015.00076/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lWCBzEwbXjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
