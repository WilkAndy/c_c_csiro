Metal (loid) s may interact with plastic in the environment and there is mixed evidence about whether plastic ingested by wildlife affects metal (loid) absorption/assimilation and concentration in the body. We examined ingested plastic and liver concentration of eleven metal (loid) s in two seabird species: fairy (Pachyptila turtur) and slender-billed prions (P. belcheri). We found significant relationships between ingested plastic and the concentrations of aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the liver of prions. We investigated whether the pattern of significant relationships reflected plastic-metal (loid) associations predicted in the scientific literature, including by transfer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8586128572098988388", "cites_id": ["8586128572098988388"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-020-75024-6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZMnK73EOKHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
