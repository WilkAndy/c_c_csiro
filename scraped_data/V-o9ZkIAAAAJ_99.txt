The uncertainties in our knowledge and the difficulty in resolving them satisfactorily can be challenging, given that we are confined to working with largely observational data because experiments at scale are difficult or impossible. To advance this area of research, we suggest applying a conceptual framework that allows us to break the components into smaller parts that can integrate uncertainty and connect variables of interest to outcomes of interest. We identify four specific questions inherent to a risk framework: the first three focus on risk analysis, and the fourth on risk management or mitigation. We present examples that are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1197085234639530417", "cites_id": ["1197085234639530417"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/ay/c6ay02934e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:semNsK3mnBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
