We present the observation details, imaging strategies, and theoretical sensitivity for GLEAM. The survey ran for two years, the first year using 40-kHz frequency resolution and 0.5-s time resolution; the second year using 10-kHz frequency resolution and 2 s time resolution. The resulting image resolution and sensitivity depends on observing frequency, sky pointing, and image weighting scheme. At 154 MHz, the image resolution is approximately 2.5 \u00d7 2.2/cos (\u03b4 + 26.7\u00b0) arcmin with sensitivity to structures up to ~ 10\u00b0 in angular size. We provide tables to calculate the expected thermal noise for GLEAM mosaics depending on pointing and frequency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=640764324435060553", "cites_id": ["640764324435060553"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/gleam-the-galactic-and-extragalactic-allsky-mwa-survey/31003E4628253D7A7BECBE5BCA07DC5D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SeexFsJz5AgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 9, "2016": 43, "2017": 37, "2018": 40, "2019": 45, "2020": 27, "2021": 47, "2022": 56, "2023": 22}}
