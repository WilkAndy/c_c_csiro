The multiple frequency bands provided by the Murchison Widefield Array allow us identify the characteristic spectrum generated by the thermal Bremsstrahlung process in H ii regions. We detect 306 H ii regions between 260\u00b0 < l < 340\u00b0 and report on the positions, sizes, peak, integrated flux density, and spectral indices of these H ii regions. By identifying the point at which H ii regions transition from the optically thin to thick regime, we derive the physical properties including the electron density, ionised gas mass, and ionising photon flux, towards 61 H ii regions. This catalogue of H ii regions represents the most extensive and uniform low frequency survey of H ii regions in the Galaxy to date."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10448893666849223161", "cites_id": ["10448893666849223161"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/largescale-lowfrequency-murchison-widefield-array-survey-of-galactic-h-ii-regions-between-260-l-340/730F44B31EBE12ED8F24D114916BA127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-XFg7G3tAZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
