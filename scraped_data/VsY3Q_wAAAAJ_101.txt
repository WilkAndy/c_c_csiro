The HMXB is located at the geometrical centre of extended soft X-ray emission, which we confirm as an SNR. The HMXB spectrum is consistent with an absorbed power law with spectral index \u223c1.6 and a luminosity of 7 \u00d7 1033\u2009erg\u2009s\u22121 (0.2\u201312\u2009keV). Tentative X-ray pulsations are observed with a periodicity of 4.4\u2009s and the OGLE I-band light curve of the optical counterpart from more than 17.5\u2009yr reveals a period of 2.2324 \u00b1 0.0003\u2009d, which we interpret as the orbital period of the binary system. The X-ray spectrum of the SNR is consistent with non-equilibrium shock models as expected for young/less evolved SNRs. From the derived ionization time-scale we estimate the age of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=743940557638985108", "cites_id": ["743940557638985108"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/490/4/5494/5601393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lOUT4P4BUwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
