Observations took place with a time resolution of 0.5 s and a frequency resolution of 10 kHz. Based on the interesting but highly unlikely suggestion that'Oumuamua is an interstellar spacecraft, due to some unusual orbital and morphological characteristics, we examine our data for signals that might indicate the presence of intelligent life associated with'Oumuamua. We searched our radio data for (1) impulsive narrowband signals,(2) persistent narrowband signals, and (3) impulsive broadband signals. We found no such signals with nonterrestrial origins and make estimates of the upper limits on equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for these three cases of approximately 7 kW, 840 W, and 100 kW \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14755916386091275408", "cites_id": ["14755916386091275408"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab359/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kBRW4MWLx8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
