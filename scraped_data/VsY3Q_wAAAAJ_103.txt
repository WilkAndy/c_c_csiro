Using a low-frequency radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), we measure the free\u2013free absorption of this Galactic synchrotron emission by intervening H\u2009ii regions along the line of sight. These absorption measurements allow us to calculate the Galactic cosmic ray electron emissivity behind and in front of 47 detected H\u2009ii regions in the region 250\u00b0 < l < 355\u00b0, |b| < 2\u00b0. We find that all average emissivities between the H\u2009ii regions and the Galactic edge along the line of sight (\u03b5b) are in the range of 0.39\u2009\u2009\u223c\u2009\u20091.45\u2009\u2009K\u2009\u2009pc\u22121 with a mean of 0.77\u2009\u2009K\u2009\u2009pc\u22121 and a variance of 0.14\u2009\u2009K\u2009\u2009pc\u22121 at 88\u2009\u2009MHz. Our best model, the two-circle model, divides the Galactic disc into three regions using two circles centring on the Galactic Centre.
