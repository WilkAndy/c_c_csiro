We develop a new method of emissivity calculation by taking advantage of the Haslam et al.  map and known spectral indices, which enable us to simultaneously derive the emissivity and the optical depth of H\u2009ii regions at each frequency. We show our derived synchrotron emissivities based on 152 absorption features of H\u2009ii regions using both the method previously adopted in the literature and our improved method. We derive the synchrotron emissivity from H\u2009ii regions to the Galactic edge along the line of sight and, for the first time, derive the emissivity from H\u2009ii regions to the Sun.
