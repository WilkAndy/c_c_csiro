We are observing at a central frequency of 8.7 GHz with a bandwidth of 256 MHz. The first observation took place from 2017-08-17 19: 58UT to 2017-08-18 01: 34UT. Analysis of the data will take place after correlation, in 7-10 days. Two subsequent epochs are planned in the coming three days. We thank the Long Baseline Observatory staff for facilitating these observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1467319033979631334", "cites_id": ["1467319033979631334"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017GCN.21588....1D/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5naGIOP2XBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 15, "2018": 2}}
