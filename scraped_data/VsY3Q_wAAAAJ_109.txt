The source was detected six times between 2020 January and 2020 September as part of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Variables and Slow Transients (ASKAP VAST) survey at 888 MHz. It exhibited a high degree (\u223c 25%) of circular polarization when it was visible. We monitored the source with the MeerKAT telescope from 2020 November to 2021 February on a 2\u20134 week cadence. The source was not detected with MeerKAT before 2021 February 7 when it appeared and reached a peak flux density of 5.6 mJy. The source was still highly circularly polarized, but also showed up to 80% linear polarization, and then faded rapidly with a timescale of one day. The rotation measure of the source varied significantly, from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12109712684281453945", "cites_id": ["12109712684281453945"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2360/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eV2jvoZXDqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
