As with previous radio interferometric observations of this galaxy, no new sources were discovered. By combining the results of this survey with Very Large Array observations at higher frequencies from the literature, spectra were derived and a free\u2013free absorption model was fitted of 20 known sources in NGC 253. The results were found to be consistent with previous studies. The supernova remnant, 5.48-43.3, was imaged with the highest sensitivity and resolution to date, revealing a two-lobed morphology. Comparisons with previous observations of similar resolution give an upper limit of 10 4 km s\u2212 1 for the expansion speed of this remnant. We derive a supernova rate of< 0.2 yr\u2212 1 for the inner 300 pc using a model that improves on previous methods by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=411966221381544720", "cites_id": ["411966221381544720"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/147/1/5/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ECvofBiZtwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
