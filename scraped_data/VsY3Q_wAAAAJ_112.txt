The VLBI observations have detected compact regions of synchrotron emission in the kiloparsec-scale jet that coincide with three stationary features identified from previous VLA monitoring observations. Each of these stationary features is associated with strong localized X-ray emission. The VLBI results strengthen arguments made by previous authors suggesting that the stationary features may be the result of stellar objects or gas clouds traversing the jet flow, intercepting the jet and causing strong shocks. The VLBI data show that the most strongly shocked regions in these features are resolved but have extents no larger than a few pc, reducing the required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18156632922426100783", "cites_id": ["18156632922426100783"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/138/3/808/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L8xe6nFR-fsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
