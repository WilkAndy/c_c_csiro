As a part of the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey, this cluster was observed at 88, 118, 154, 188, and 215 MHz. The known radio relics, towards the eastern and western peripheries of the cluster, were detected at all the frequencies. The relics, with a linear extent of \u223c1 Mpc each, are separated by \u223c2 Mpc. Combining the current observations with those in the literature, we have obtained the spectra of these relics over the frequency range 80\u20131400 MHz. The spectra follow power laws, with \u03b1 = \u22121.17 \u00b1 0.06 and \u22121.37 \u00b1 0.08 for the west and east relics, respectively (S\u221d\u03bd\u03b1). Assuming the break frequency to be near the lower end of the spectrum we estimate the age of the relics to be \u223c0.4 Gyr. No diffuse radio emission from the central \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16413760416075314872", "cites_id": ["16413760416075314872"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/451/4/4207/1106257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uHaJdCJkyeMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
