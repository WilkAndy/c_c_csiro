We conducted an untargeted search over a 30 deg2 field, with multiple 10-h observations separated by days to months, at a central frequency of 945 MHz. We discovered six rapid scintillators from 15-min model-subtracted images with sensitivity of Jy/beam; two of them are extreme intra-hour variables with modulation indices up to  and timescales as short as tens of minutes. Five of the variables are in a linear arrangement on the sky with angular width \u223c1 arcmin and length \u223c2 degrees, revealing the existence of a huge plasma filament in front of them. We derived kinematic models of this plasma from the annual modulation of the scintillation rate of our sources, and we estimated its likely physical properties: a distance of \u223c4 pc and length of \u223c0.1 pc.
