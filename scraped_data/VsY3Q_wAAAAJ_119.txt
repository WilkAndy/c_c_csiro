In this paper, we discuss the overall radio continuum morphology between 76 and 227 MHz and compare them with neutral hydrogen maps, 1.4 GHz continuum maps and optical images. Variation of diffuse emission is noticeable across the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) but absent across the bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We also measure the integrated flux densities and derive the spectral indices for the MCs. A double power-law model with fixed \u03b11 = \u22120.1 fit between 19.7 MHz and 8.55 GHz yields \u03b10 = \u22120.66 \u00b1 0.08 for the LMC. A power-law model yields  for the SMC. The radio spectral index maps reveal distinctive flat and steep spectral indices for the H\u2009ii regions and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2070792871990969406", "cites_id": ["2070792871990969406"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/480/2/2743/5057489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PsRuQiXvvBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
