We introduce several novel analysis techniques, such as cable reflection calibration, hyper-resolution gridding kernels, diffuse foreground model subtraction, and quality control methods. Each change to the analysis pipeline is tested against a two-dimensional power spectrum figure of merit to demonstrate improvement. We incorporate the new techniques into a deep integration of 32 hours of MWA data. This data set is used to place a systematic-limited upper limit on the cosmological power spectrum of  mK 2 at k= 0.27 h Mpc\u2212 1 and z= 7.1, consistent with other published limits, and a modest improvement (factor of 1.4) over previous MWA results.
