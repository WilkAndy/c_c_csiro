The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) has localised 11 FRBs with sub-arcsecond to arcsecond precision, leading to sub-galaxy localisation regions in some cases and those covering much of the host galaxy in others. The method used to astrometrically register the FRB image frame for ASKAP, in order to align it with images taken at other wavelengths, is currently limited by the brightness of continuum sources detected in the short-duration (\u2018snapshot\u2019) voltage data captured by the Commensal Real-Time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) software correlator, which are used to correct for any frame offsets due to imperfect calibration solutions and estimate the accuracy of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10054631139166884879", "cites_id": ["10054631139166884879"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/astrometric-accuracy-of-snapshot-fast-radio-burst-localisations-with-askap/62FE0D4D1D5A96A592A866EA296C62F6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D5Sf1b85iYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
