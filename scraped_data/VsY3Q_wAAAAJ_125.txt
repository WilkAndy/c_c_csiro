We have carried out 10 epochs of observation spanning 2\u2013655 d post-merger at a frequency of 944\u2009MHz. Each observation covered 30\u2009deg2, corresponding to 87 per\u2009cent of the posterior distribution of the merger\u2019s sky location. We conducted an untargeted search for radio transients in the field, as well as a targeted search for transients associated with known galaxies. We find one radio transient, ASKAP J005022.3\u2212230349, but conclude that it is unlikely to be associated with the merger. We use our observations to place constraints on the inclination angle of the merger and the density of the surrounding environment by comparing our non-detection to model predictions for radio emission from compact binary coalescences.
