The MPI-based package is the primary software for storing and processing raw data, and initiating the archiving of resulting science data products into the data archive (CASDA). The processing pipelines within ASKAPsoft are largely written in C++ built on top of casacore (ascl: 1912.002) and other third party libraries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1372305605016215475", "cites_id": ["1372305605016215475"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ascl.soft12003G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s99ETq1oCxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
