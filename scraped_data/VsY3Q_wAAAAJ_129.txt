Our search used the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, covering the entire celestial sphere south of declination +41\u25cb, and three epochs of the Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey (Phase 1), covering \u223c5000 square degrees per epoch. The observations we used from these surveys spanned a nine-month period from 2019 April 21 to 2020 January 11. We cross-matched radio sources found in these surveys with 779 well-localized (to \u226415 arcsec) long gamma-ray bursts occurring after 2004 and determined whether the associations were more likely afterglow- or host-related through the analysis of optical images. In our search, we detected one radio afterglow candidate associated with GRB 171205A, a local low-luminosity gamma-ray burst with a supernova counterpart \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10623883006648425077", "cites_id": ["10623883006648425077"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/503/2/1847/6129796", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dZqWik6db5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
