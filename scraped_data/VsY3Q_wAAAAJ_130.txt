The pulsar is located about 1 from the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and has a significant fractional circular polarization of\u223c 20%. We discovered pulsations with a period of 322.5 ms, dispersion measure (DM) of 157.5 pc cm\u2212 3, and rotation measure (RM) of+ 456 rad m\u2212 2 using observations from the MeerKAT and the Parkes telescopes. This DM firmly places the source, PSR J0523\u2212 7125, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This RM is extreme compared to other pulsars in the LMC (more than twice that of the largest previously reported one). The average flux density of\u223c 1 mJy at 1400 MHz and\u223c 25 mJy at 400 MHz places it among the most luminous radio pulsars known. It likely evaded previous discovery \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12654558714216965230", "cites_id": ["12654558714216965230"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac61dc/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:buQ5lhoGnq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
