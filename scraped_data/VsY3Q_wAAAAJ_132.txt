The observations were conducted at a frequency of 943 MHz on 2019-08-16 and 2019-08-23 (see GCN 25445 and GCN 25472 for details). We searched for sources with a rising flux density between the two observations that are spatially coincident with known galaxies selected from the GLADE catalogue (D\u00e1lya et al. 2018). One candidate is ASKAP 005547-270433, reported as AT2019osy on the Transient Name Server, at RA= 00: 55: 47, Dec=-27: 04: 33, offset~ 1 arcsecond from 2dFGRS TGS211Z177. ASKAP 005547-270433 has a 943 MHz integrated flux density of 376+/-33 uJy in epoch 1 and 550+/-34 uJy in epoch 2. The redshift of 2dFGRS TGS211Z177 is 0.0738, which is consistent with the luminosity distance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7750683467724733866", "cites_id": ["7750683467724733866"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019GCN.25487....1S/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qr05jIz1j2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
