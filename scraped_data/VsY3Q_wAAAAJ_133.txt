It uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of the w-snapshot algorithm. It supports full-sky imaging and proper beam correction for homogeneous dipole arrays such as the MWA. WSClean allows Hogbom and Cotton-Schwab cleaning, and can clean polarizations joinedly. All operations are performed on the CPU; it is not specialized for GPUs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8219478357611141321", "cites_id": ["8219478357611141321"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ascl.soft08023O/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yVhsgAR0EXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
