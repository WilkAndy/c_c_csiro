The survey region consisted of five fields covering  (350\u25cb \u2272 l \u2272 10\u25cb, |b| \u2272 10\u25cb). Each field was observed for 12\u2009min, with between 7 and 9 repeats on cadences of between one day and four months. We detected eight highly variable sources and seven highly circularly polarized sources (14 unique sources in total). Seven of these sources are known pulsars including the rotating radio transient PSR J1739\u20132521 and the eclipsing pulsar PSR J1723\u20132837. One of them is a low-mass X-ray binary, 4U 1758\u201325. Three of them are coincident with optical or infrared sources and are likely to be stars. The remaining three may be related to the class of Galactic Centre Radio Transients (including a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16754312992678914187", "cites_id": ["16754312992678914187"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/4/5972/6696018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i6hWEOZGg-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
