By using data from several radio surveys of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly 23h field and from a dedicated follow-up, we were able to constrain the radio spectrum of VIK J2318\u22123113 in the observed range \u223c0.1\u201310 GHz. At high frequencies (0.888\u20135.5 GHz in the observed frame) the QSO presents a steep spectrum (\u03b1r\u2004=\u20041.24, with S\u03bd\u2004\u221d\u2004\u03bd\u2212\u03b1r), while at lower frequencies (0.4\u20130.888 GHz in the observed frame) it is nearly flat. The overall spectrum can be modelled by either a curved function with a rest-frame turnover around 5 GHz, or with a smoothly varying double power law that is flat below a rest-frame break frequency of about 20 GHz and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12950023813929903575", "cites_id": ["12950023813929903575"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/07/aa42733-21/aa42733-21.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1yUk7gu6t7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
