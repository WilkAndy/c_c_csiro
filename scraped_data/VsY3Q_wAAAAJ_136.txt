Bandpass correction is typically performed by comparing measurements of a strong calibrator source to an assumed model, typically an isolated point source. The wide field-of-view and high sensitivity of modern interferometers means that additional sources are often detected in observations of calibrators. This can introduce errors into bandpass corrections and subsequently the target data if not properly accounted for. Focusing on the standard calibrator PKS B1934-638, we perform simulations to asses this effect by constructing a wide-field sky model. The cases of ASKAP (0.7\u20131.9\u2009GHz), MeerKAT (UHF: 0.58\u20131.05\u2009GHz; L-band: 0.87\u20131.67\u2009GHz) and Band 2 (0.95\u20131.76\u2009GHz) of SKA-MID are examined.
