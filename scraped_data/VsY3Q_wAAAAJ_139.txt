We have observed a single 30 sq. deg. field centered on RA= 00: 50: 37.5 Dec=-25: 16: 57.4 which covers approximately 85% of the sky localisation from the LALInference skymap (GCN 25333), with a median rms of 34 uJy. We have searched for radio emission within 5 arcseconds of the location of the 124 optical transients reported on the Transient Name Server by the DECam-GROWTH and DESGW teams between 2019-08-16 and 2019-08-22 as at 2019-08-22 03: 00 UTC.
