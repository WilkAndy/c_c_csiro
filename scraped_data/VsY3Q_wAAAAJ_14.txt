We describe the automated radio-frequency interference detection strategy implemented for the Murchison Widefield Array, which is based on the aoflagger platform, and present 72\u2013231 MHz radio-frequency interference statistics from 10 observing nights. Radio-frequency interference detection removes 1.1% of the data. Radio-frequency interference from digital TV is observed 3% of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric propagation. After radio-frequency interference detection and excision, almost all data can be calibrated and imaged without further radio-frequency interference mitigation efforts, including observations within the FM and digital TV bands. The results are compared to a previously published Low-Frequency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4673260959645254175", "cites_id": ["4673260959645254175"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/lowfrequency-environment-of-the-murchison-widefield-array-radiofrequency-interference-analysis-and-mitigation/DCBEF7DF93C8452FDF7E15E8398EED9D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H0JbMhXC2kAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 23, "2017": 25, "2018": 25, "2019": 23, "2020": 22, "2021": 15, "2022": 23, "2023": 10}}
