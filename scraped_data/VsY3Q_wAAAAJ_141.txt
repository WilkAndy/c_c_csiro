In-beam calibration was used to calibrate each field, the process was simplified by imaging the calibrators in DIFMAP and transferring the calibration solutions to AIPS using the newly developed DIFMAP task - cordump. We detected and imaged 13 out of the 141 sources originally detected by the low resolution (54\") WENSS survey of the same two fields. The sources were detected at 7-12 sigma levels above the image noise, had total flux densities ranging between 85-1640 mJy and were between 16'-58' from the phase centre of each field. This is the first systematic (and non-biased), deep, high resolution survey of the low frequency radio sky. These initial results suggest that new instruments such as LOFAR should detect many compact radio sources and that plans to extend these arrays to baselines of several thousand kilometres are warranted."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15318746507483235477", "cites_id": ["15318746507483235477"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612618", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lUTLTskel9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
