We found a spatial coincidence between the northern H\u202fI tail and a depolarized structure observed for the first time with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 1.2 GHz. We analyzed the properties of the rotation measure (RM) image obtained with ASKAP data at the location of the H\u202fI tail and in its neighborhood. We modeled the observed RM structure function to investigate the magnetic field power spectrum at the location of the H\u202fI tail and in a nearby control region. We found that the observed RM, in the control region and in a region enclosing the H\u202fI tail, cannot be due to the intracluster Faraday screen caused by the Fornax cluster. An intragroup magnetized medium with a central magnetic field strength of 18.5 \u03bcG can explain the control \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17573639978716516760", "cites_id": ["17573639978716516760"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/04/aa42879-21/aa42879-21.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mFEAlnMc4vMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
