Perley et al. use Very Large Array and VLBA archival data (between 1989 and 1997) to show that the transient rises in flux density by a factor of at least 5 in less than approximately 20 yr. With the additional data presented here, we revise the rise time to between approximately 4 and 6 yr, based on a new detection of the source at 15.4 GHz from 2011 October. Our results strengthen the interpretation of Cyg A-2 as the result of a tidal disruption event (TDE), as we can identify the location of the compact object responsible for the TDE and can estimate the angular expansion speed of the resulting radio-emitting structures, equivalent to an apparent expansion speed of< \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3765240948941595164", "cites_id": ["3765240948941595164"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb60d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HCJrp7HSQDQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
