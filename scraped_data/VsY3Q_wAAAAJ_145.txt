We select eight sources from deep radio observations that have radio spectra characteristic of a GPS or CSS source and an angular size of \u03b8 \u2272 2\u2009arcsec, and detect six of them with the Australian Long Baseline Array. We determine their linear sizes, and model their radio spectra using synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) and free\u2013free absorption (FFA) models. We derive statistical model ages, based on a fitted scaling relation, and spectral ages, based on the radio spectrum, which are generally consistent with the hypothesis that GPS and CSS sources are young and evolving. We resolve the morphology of one CSS source with a radio luminosity of , and find what appear to be two hotspots spanning 1.7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8231289714646345951", "cites_id": ["8231289714646345951"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/477/1/578/4919642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:32jSXGJqO3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
