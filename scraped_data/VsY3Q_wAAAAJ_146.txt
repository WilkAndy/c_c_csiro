LVC GCN 21529) we conducted further observations of NGC 4993 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 5.5 and 9 GHz. Observations started at 2017-09-04 22: 43: 04 UT and ended at 2017-09-05 10: 03: 04 UT with approximately 9.5 hours of on-source time. We did not make a robust detection, although there is marginal emission at the 4-sigma level, at a position consistent with that reported by Mooley at al. and Corsi et al. This could be associated with the host galaxy or the optical transient. Analysis is ongoing, and subsequent epochs are planned. Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18004624995860965073", "cites_id": ["18004624995860965073"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017GCN.21842....1M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0WZpiApH3fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
