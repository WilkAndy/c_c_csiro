Summarising, instrumental on-axis polarization levels of P/I% 0.1% can be achieved with standard calibration techniques, and without splitting the 2 GHz band into smaller sub-bands. Off-axis leakages can be suppressed by mosaicking, basing the pointing distance on the half-power beamwidth at 3.1 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5493046720239547545", "cites_id": ["5493046720239547545"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30782364/AT39.9_129.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mbSAfuM4O0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
