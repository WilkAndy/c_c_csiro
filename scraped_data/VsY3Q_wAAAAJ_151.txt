The tenth DWF observing run was carried out in near real-time during September 2021, and consisted of six consecutive days of observations of the NGC\u20096744 galaxy group and a field containing the repeating fast radio burst FRB\u2009190711 with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Dark Energy Camera, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, and the Parkes 64-m \u2018Murriyang\u2019 radio telescope. In this work, we present the results of an image-domain search for transient, variable, and circularly polarized sources carried out with ASKAP, using data from the observing run along with test observations prior to the run and follow-up observations carried out during and after the run. We identified eight variable radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14510355995118148507", "cites_id": ["14510355995118148507"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/519/3/4684/6960579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mxt6_eUjX8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
