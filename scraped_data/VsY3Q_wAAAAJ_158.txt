From the conservative assumption that this value exceeds the Eddington limit by at most a factor of 10, the minimum mass is then 500 solar masses. The X-ray luminosity varies by a factor of 40 with an apparent recurrence timescale of approximately one year. This X-ray variability is associated with spectral state transitions similar to those seen in black hole X-ray binaries. Here we discuss our recent modelling of all the X-ray data for HLX-1 and show that it supports the idea that this ULX is powered by sub- and near Eddington accretion onto an intermediate mass black hole. We also present evidence for transient radio emission which is consistent with a discrete jet ejection event as well as comment on the nature of the environment around HLX-1 in light of recent Hubble Space Telescope photometry."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=517909555056314913", "cites_id": ["517909555056314913"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0831", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IYrpDv_7LwcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
