We investigate the signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements. These wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes impact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most desirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a dipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array observations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the largest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3074582054566303635", "cites_id": ["3074582054566303635"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/14/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kxc3uxYcqyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 9, "2016": 30, "2017": 19, "2018": 25, "2019": 25, "2020": 20, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 11}}
