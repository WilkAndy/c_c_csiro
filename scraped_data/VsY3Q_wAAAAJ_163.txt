A starburst is triggered by the rapid accumulation of gas in a small volume, causing large numbers of massive stars to form. The accumulation of gas can be caused by interactions between galaxies, for example the merger of gas rich spiral galaxies can result in the accumulation of 60% of the gas within the inner 100 pc of the merger product (Barnes & Hernquist, 1996). Gas can be funnelled into the nuclear region of a galaxy by dynamical processes associated with bar instabilities (Combes, 2000).Once formed, the starburst hosts large numbers of massive stars that ionise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17581210363991018701", "cites_id": ["17581210363991018701"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17581210363991018701&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zcwZQ60B_fMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
