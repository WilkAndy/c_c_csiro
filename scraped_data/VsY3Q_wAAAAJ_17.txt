They have been observed from stellar-mass black holes (~3 to 20 solar masses, M\u2609) as well as supermassive black holes (~106 to 109 M\u2609) found in the centers of most galaxies. Jets should also be produced by intermediate-mass black holes (~102 to 105 M\u2609), although evidence for this third class of black hole has, until recently, been weak. We report the detection of transient radio emission at the location of the intermediate-mass black hole candidate ESO 243-49 HLX-1, which is consistent with a discrete jet ejection event. These observations also allow us to refine the mass estimate of the black hole to be between ~9 \u00d7 103 M\u2609 and ~9 \u00d7 104 M\u2609."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16576284081223492163", "cites_id": ["16576284081223492163"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1222779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q-JJBYzKCuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 19, "2015": 19, "2016": 16, "2017": 15, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 18, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 12}}
