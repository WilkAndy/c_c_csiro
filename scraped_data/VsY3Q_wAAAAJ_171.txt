Our search used the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, which covered the entire sky south of declination ( square degrees) at a central frequency of 887.5 MHz, the Variables and Slow Transients Pilot Survey, which covered square degrees per epoch (887.5 MHz), and other ASKAP pilot surveys, which covered 200\u20132000 square degrees with 2\u201312 h integration times. We crossmatched radio sources found in these surveys over a two\u2013year period, from 2019 April to 2021 August, with 440 previously identified optical novae, and found radio counterparts for four novae: V5668 Sgr, V1369 Cen, YZ Ret, and RR Tel. Follow-up observations with the Australian Telescope Compact Array confirm the ejecta thinning across all observed bands with spectral analysis indicative of synchrotron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/classical-novae-in-the-askap-pilot-surveys/A050027C6592CD3C863E220CBE18254F", "cites_per_year": {}}
