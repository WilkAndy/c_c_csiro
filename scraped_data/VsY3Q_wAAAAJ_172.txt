Discovering more pulsars emitting at low radio frequencies is crucial to further our understanding of spectral properties and emission mechanisms. The Murchison Widefield Array Voltage Capture System (MWA VCS) has been routinely used to study pulsars at low frequencies and discover new pulsars. The MWA VCS offers the unique opportunity of recording complex voltages from all individual antennas (tiles), which can be off-line beamformed or correlated/imaged at millisecond time resolution. Devising imaged-based methods for finding pulsar candidates, which can be verified in beamformed data, can accelerate the complete process and lead to more pulsar detections. Image-based searches for pulsar candidates can reduce the number of tied-array beams required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/imagebased-searches-for-pulsar-candidates-using-mwa-vcs-data/D79208D48F08957426C14E09678888A5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jmkzmloXl_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
