Each observation lasted 2 hours. From our preliminary analysis, no source is detected with a> 3 sigma significance at a position consistent with previous detections (de Wet et al., GCN 32289; Izzo et al., GCN 32291; Gropp et al., GCN 32296; Nicuesa Guelbenzu et al., GCN 32304; Leung et al., GCN 32341). The rms noise is approximately 9 and 14 uJy/beam, in the first and second epoch, respectively. Further observations are planned. We would like to thank the MeerKAT personnel for approving, executing, and processing these observations.
