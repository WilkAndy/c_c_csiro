We detected a radio source with a preliminary flux density of~ 0.4 mJy at a central frequency of 17 GHz at RA= 13: 25: 28.48 Dec=-32: 25: 32.14 with positional uncertainty of~ 1.5 arcsec. The position of the radio source is consistent with the candidate optical (de Wet et al., GCN Circ. 32289) and X-ray afterglow (Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 32296) positions. Further observations with several facilities at different frequencies are ongoing. We thank CSIRO staff for rapidly scheduling and supporting these observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022GCN.32341....1L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
