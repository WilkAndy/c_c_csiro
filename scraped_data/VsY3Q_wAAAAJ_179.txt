We calculate the synchrotron emissivities both behind and in front of 152 HII regions at six frequencies of 76.2, 83.8, 91.5, 99.2, 106.9, and 114.6 MHz. This new method enables us to derive the HII region optical depth and estimate the amount of flux density missing from our observations at each frequency. We find that the emissivities increase towards the Galactic centre."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022yCat..74794041S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
