The GLEAM-6dFGS sample contains 1590 sources with a median redshift of 0.064 and 200MHz radio luminosities in the range~ 10 22-10 27 W/Hz. The optical spectra indicate that 73 per cent of the sources are fuelled by AGN activity and 27 per cent by star formation. The vast majority (81 per cent) of the AGN have pure absorption-line spectra typical of giant elliptical galaxies. The AGN with emission-line spectra typically have lower luminosities and overlap in luminosity with the SF galaxies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021yCatp019003801F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
