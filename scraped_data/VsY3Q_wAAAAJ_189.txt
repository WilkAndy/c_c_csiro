Here, we present the discovery of an extreme flaring event from Proxima Cen by the the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of> 1000 and> 14000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://assets.pubpub.org/ht9rcpcw/0e38621f-6b98-4268-917a-646b623a7032.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
