Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Our observations demonstrate that the radio afterglow peaked at 149\u00b12 days post-merger and is now declining in flux density. We see no evidence for evolution in the radio-only spectral index, which remains consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission connecting the radio, optical, and X-ray regimes. The peak implies a total energy in the synchrotron-emitting component of a few\u00d7 10 50 erg. The temporal decay rate is most consistent with mildly or non-relativistic material and we do not see evidence for a very energetic off-axis jet, but we cannot distinguish between a lower-energy jet and more isotropic emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1520601025698719984", "cites_id": ["1520601025698719984"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aac105/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8OjdjZNCGhUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 24, "2019": 40, "2020": 26, "2021": 28, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
