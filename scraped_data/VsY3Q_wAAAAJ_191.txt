We report flux densities of: 369+/-23 uJy at 5.0 GHz 335+/-19 uJy at 6.0 GHz 307+/-15 uJy at 8.5 GHz 278+/-14 uJy at 9.5 GHz Fitting a power-law to these values we find a spectral index of alpha=-0.39+/-0.11, consistent with the value of-0.42 found by Mooley et al.(GCN 25539). Comparing to the VLA observations reported by Mooley et al.(GCN 25539), we find that the flux density has increased by~ 40% in 1.5 days across 4.5-10 GHz. Additional epochs are required to separate intrinsic variability from contamination from propagation effects and systematics due to differing spatial resolution between the ATCA, VLA and ASKAP. Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019GCN.25621....1D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
