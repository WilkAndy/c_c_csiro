The 3-sigma upper limits at the position of this source are 75 uJy on 2019-08-16 and 96 uJy on 2019-08-23. Both observations were a 30 sq. deg. field of the localisation region of S190814bv (LVC, GCN 25324) centered on RA= 00: 50: 37.5 Dec=-25: 16: 57.4 with a central frequency of 943 MHz with a bandwidth of 288 MHz, as reported in GCN 25445. Further analysis of these ASKAP observations are ongoing and future epochs are planned. Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019GCN.25472....1D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
