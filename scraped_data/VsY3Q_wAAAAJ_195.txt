The radio spectral energy distribution obtained with the Murchison Widefield Array, together with the surveys at other radio continuum frequencies is discussed. In addition, we have also examined an archival XMM-Newton observation which allowed us to detect an X-ray emission from this remnant for the first time. Finally, a detailed X-ray spectral analysis will be presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019sros.confE..55O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
