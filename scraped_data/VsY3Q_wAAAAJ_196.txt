Observations took place with time resolution of 0.5 s and frequency resolution of 10 kHz. %This observation was undertaken for another purpose but due to the MWA's extremely large field-of-view, 'Oumuamua was serendipitously observed simultaneously. Based on the interesting but highly unlikely suggestion that 'Oumuamua is an interstellar spacecraft, due to some unusual orbital and morphological characteristics, we examine our data for signals that might indicate the presence of intelligent life associated with 'Oumuamua. We searched our radio data for: 1) impulsive narrow-band signals; 2) persistent narrow-band signals; and 3) impulsive broadband signals. We found no such signals with non-terrestrial origins and make estimates of the upper limits on Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) for these three cases of approximately 7 kW, 840 W, and 100 kW, respectively. These transmitter powers are well within the capabilities of human technologies, and are therefore plausible for alien civilizations. While the chances of positive detection in any given Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) experiment are vanishingly small, the characteristics of new generation telescopes such as the MWA (and in the future, the Square Kilometre Array) make certain classes of SETI experiment easy, or even a trivial by-product of astrophysical observations. This means that the future costs of SETI experiments are very low, allowing large target \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uPtrXXxQLrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
