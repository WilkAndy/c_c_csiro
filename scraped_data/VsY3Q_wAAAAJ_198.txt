The FWHM of the antenna beam is approximately 20, but sources in the edges of the beam and first few side lobes are clearly visible and should be subtracted (Thyagarajan et al., 2015ApJ... 804... 14T, 2015ApJ... 807L.. 28T; Pober et al., 2016ApJ... 819.... 8P). For this catalogue we concentrate on identifying sources in the primary beam but go out to the 5 per cent power point (nearly first beam null,~ 1400deg 2). The data for this catalogue include 752min snapshot observations (112s consecutive integrations with 8s gaps) from the night of 2013 August 23. The observations were made at 182MHz with 31MHz bandwidth and cover 2.5 h in total."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018yCat..74614151C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
