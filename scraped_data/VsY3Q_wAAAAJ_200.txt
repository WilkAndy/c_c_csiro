We also use the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon+ 1998, VIII/65) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS; See Mauch+ 2008, VIII/81). Since the combination of NVSS and SUMSS cover the entire GLEAM survey and are an order of magnitude more sensitive, this study is sensitive to peaked-spectrum sources that peak anywhere between 72MHz and 843MHz/1.4 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017yCat..18360174C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
