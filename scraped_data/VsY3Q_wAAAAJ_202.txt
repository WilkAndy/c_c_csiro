Many types of variable and transient sources are predicted and observed at low frequencies. For example, flares from low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, magnetars, and flares associated with state transitions in accreting stellar-mass and intermediate-mass black holes. In addition, possible non-repeating transient sources, such as merging black holes and tidal disruption events, are expected to emit at MWA frequencies. The MWA is extremely well-suited for blind transient surveys due to its large instantaneous field of view and high sensitivity. We propose to continue our survey of transient and variable sources in the EOR (Epoch of Reionisation) fields. This is a commensal project, sharing data with the EOR collaboration and targets transient events on time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017mwa..prop..A04M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
