The GLEAM survey is the widest fractional bandwidth all-sky survey to date, ideal for identifying peaked-spectrum sources at low radio frequencies. Our peaked-spectrum sources are the low-frequency analogs of gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) and compact-steep spectrum (CSS) sources, which have been hypothesized to be the precursors to massive radio galaxies. Our sample more than doubles the number of known peaked-spectrum candidates, and 95% of our sample have a newly characterized spectral peak. We highlight that some GPS sources peaking above 5 GHz have had multiple epochs of nuclear activity, and we demonstrate the possibility of identifying high-redshift (z> 2) galaxies via steep optically thin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10251507276152183925", "cites_id": ["10251507276152183925"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/836/2/174/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dRxih42rRI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 15, "2019": 27, "2020": 19, "2021": 31, "2022": 27, "2023": 13}}
