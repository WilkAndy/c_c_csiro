Using a low-frequency radio telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), we measure the free-free absorption of this Galactic synchrotron emission by intervening HII regions along the line of sight. These absorption measurements allow us to calculate the Galactic cosmic-ray electron emissivity behind and in front of 47 detected HII regions in the region , . We find that all average emissivities between the HII regions and the Galactic edge along the line of sight () are in the range of 0.240.70Kpc with a mean of 0.40Kpc and a variance of 0.10Kpc at 88MHz. Our best model, the Two-circle model, divides the Galactic disk into three regions using two circles centring on the Galactic centre. It shows a high emissivity region near the Galactic centre, a low emissivity region near the Galactic edge, and a medium emissivity region between these two regions, contrary to the trend found by previous studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XbWZBeSnkQUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
