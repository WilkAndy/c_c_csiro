Projects are already making use of data from the MWA-128T to search for many transient events. Data from G0001 (MWATS) is being used to search for pulsars based on their scintillating behavior (Bell et al., 2016). Project G0026 is searching for intrinsic emission associated with fireballs. Project G0005 has used data from EoR observations to search for fast radio bursts and conduct a blind survey for radio transients (see Rowlinson et al., 2016). These areas of research are still of great interest, and we would like to be able to continue these programs into 2017A, however the feasibility of the MWA-Hex configuration for these projects has not yet been demonstrated. We are asking for 20h of observations to demonstrate the feasibility of the MWA-Hex configuration for fast radio transient detection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016mwa..prop..B03H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
