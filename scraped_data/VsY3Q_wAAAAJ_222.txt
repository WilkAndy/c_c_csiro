With a flux density limit of 4 Jy this sample is significantly larger than the canonical fully-complete sample, 3CRR (Laing, Riley & Longair 1983). In analysing this small bright subset of the GLEAM survey we are also providing a first user check of the GLEAM catalogue ahead of its public release (Hurley-Walker et al. in prep). Whilst significant work remains to fully characterise our new bright source sample, in time it will provide important constraints to evolutionary behaviour, across a wide redshift and intrinsic radio power range, as well as being highly complementary to results from targeted, small area surveys."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yYUkUcNdp1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
