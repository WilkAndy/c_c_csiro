These two fields have previously been observed at 1.4 GHz as part of the ATLAS project and are described by Hales et al.(2014, Cat. J/MNRAS/441/2555). Both of these fields were originally targeted for radio observations as they overlap with SWIRE which includes infrared and optical data for the majority of the radio objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016yCat..74534020F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
