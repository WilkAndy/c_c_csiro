This article empirically explores the effect of foreground spectra on EoR experiments by measuring high-resolution full-polarization spectra for the 586 brightest unresolved sources in one of the MWA EoR fields using 45 h of observation. A novel peeling scheme is used to subtract 2500 sources from the visibilities with ionospheric and beam corrections, resulting in the deepest, confusion-limited MWA image so far. The resulting spectra are found to be affected by instrumental effects, which limit the constraints that can be set on source-intrinsic spectral structure. The sensitivity and power-spectrum of the spectra are analysed, and it is found that the spectra of residuals are dominated by PSF sidelobes from nearby undeconvolved sources. We release a catalogue describing the spectral parameters for each measured source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R0rDS_fBWcwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
