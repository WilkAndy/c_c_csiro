Each antenna is equipped with linearly polarized feeds used to measure all four polarization products (XX, YY, XY, YX), from which all four Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V) can be derived. Noise diodes in the feed horns of each antenna replace the need to observe a polarization position angle calibrator to derive absolute XY phase."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015yCat..74412555H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
