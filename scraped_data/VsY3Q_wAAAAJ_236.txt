A simple model that accounts for inter-element mutual coupling is presented which explains the false polarization leakage in Stokes Q (\u201cfalse Q\u201d) seen when the array is scanned away from zenith in the principal planes. On these planes the model predicts current imbalance in the X (E-W) and Y (N-S) dipoles and hence the false Q. More sophisticated models intended to calibrate actual observation data will be briefly discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6887732/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VCtdis0euJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
