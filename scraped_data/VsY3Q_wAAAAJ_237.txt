These techniques are used to target three specific science areas: (i) a sub-parsec-scale study of compact radio sources in nearby starburst galaxies, (ii) a study of jet interactions in active radio galaxies, and (iii) an unbiased study of the sub-arcsecond, 90 cm sky."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4791", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lvSH7qRjI8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
