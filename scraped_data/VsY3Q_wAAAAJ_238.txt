This observation was prompted by X-ray observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which revealed a highly collimated jet over 1.9'long (Wilson et al. 2001) that was only recently clearly detected at 4.8 GHz with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (Marshall et al. 2010). HST observations were taken using the WFC3 at 1600nm, 814nm, and 475nm. After subtracting a model of the host galaxy, a giant elliptical, we measured the core flux, the tidal tail and the jet feature. The formation of the tidal tail provides possible insight to what triggered AGN activity within Pictor A. The jet knot at 30\" from the core is clearly extended about 5\" along the jet at 1600nm but is faint and point-like at 814nm and not detected at 475nm. The fluxes from the HST images are compared to models of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22325006G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
