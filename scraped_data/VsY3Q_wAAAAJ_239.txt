Their feedback can enrich the IGM of metals and regulate galactic-scale processes like suppressing star formation or taking out low angular momentum gas from the galaxy centre. They can also generate galactic-scale magnetic fields. But what about normal and moderate starburst galaxies? They were believed not to posses any, but the recent discovery of the Milky Way's lobes, giant star formation-driven outflows from the centre of the Galaxy, has changed the scenario. Here we propose to observe a sample of normal and starburst galaxies to first detect full galactic-scale polarised lobes from nuclear starbursts in external galaxies. This will help understand whether the extraplanar emission of starburst galaxies and the Milky Way's lobes are of the same nature, how common such outflows are in normal galaxies, and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5878C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
