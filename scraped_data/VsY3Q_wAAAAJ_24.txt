Here we describe the Cosmological H i Power Spectrum Estimator (CHIPS), an algorithm developed and implemented with data from the Murchison Widefield Array, to compute the two-dimensional and spherically-averaged power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations. The principal motivations for CHIPS are the application of realistic instrumental and foreground models to form the optimal estimator, thereby maximizing the likelihood of unbiased signal estimation, and allowing a full covariant understanding of the outputs. CHIPS employs an inverse-covariance weighting of the data through the maximum likelihood estimator, thereby allowing use of the full parameter space for signal estimation (\" \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3135700695552456103", "cites_id": ["3135700695552456103"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/818/2/139/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p3VZQCs_hCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 16, "2017": 14, "2018": 21, "2019": 30, "2020": 14, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 10}}
