Single-pointing HI 21-cm studies exist, but fail to cover the full extent of this remarkable galaxy. Peculiar halo filaments near the edge of the stellar disk hint at extraplanar HI gas. We propose to complete our 6-point mosaic with ATCA at high velocity resolution and good sensitivity to investigate the gas dynamics of NGC 253 over its full extent."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5859K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
