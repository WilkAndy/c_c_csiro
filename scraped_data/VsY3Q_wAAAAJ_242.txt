On the other hand, it has a radio-loud AGN embedded in its core. We have imaged this radio source with the Australian LBA, and show that it consists of two jets just 7 pc across, which are presumably boring their way out through the dust and gas surrounding them, and will eventually break out, quenching the star formation and signalling the appearance of a radio-loud quasar or radio galaxy. IRAS F00183-711 therefore appears to have been caught in the fleeting transition from \u201ccold-mode\u201d accretion to \u201chot-mode\u201d accretion, showing a radio-loud AGN ramping up its activity while the host is still undergoing a vigorous starburst. The``standard model''suggests that this activity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5882N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
