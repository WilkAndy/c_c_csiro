This source appears to be a rare example of a ULIRG glimpsed in the (presumably) brief period as it changes from \"quasar mode\" to \"radio mode\" activity. Such transition stages probably account for many of the high-redshift radio-galaxies and extreme high-redshift ULIRGs, and so this object at the relatively low redshift of 0.328 offers a rare opportunity to study this class of objects in detail. We have also detected the CO signal from this galaxy with the ATCA, and here describe the implications of this detection for future ULIRG studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3953", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R09LPzduiocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
