We have observed the extended Chandra Deep Field South at 5.5 GHz using a mosaic of 42 pointings with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our image reaches an almost uniform sensitivity of~ 12 \u03bcJy rms over 0.25 deg^ 2 with a restoring beam of 4.9\u00d7 2.0 arcsec, making it one of the deepest 6cm surveys to date. We present the 5.5 GHz source counts from this field. We take advantage of the large amounts of ancillary data in this field to study the 1.4 to 5.5 GHz spectral indices of the sub-mJy population. For the full 5.5 GHz selected sample we find a flat median spectral index, \u03b1_med=-0.40, consistent with previous results. However, the spectral index appears to steepen at the faintest flux density \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AAS...22114714H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
