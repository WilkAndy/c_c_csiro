The proximity of Circinus allows us to observe in striking detail the structure of the radio lobes, revealing for the first time edge-brightened emission both in X-rays and radio. After considering various other possible scenarios, we show that this extended emission in Circinus is most likely caused by a jet-driven outflow, which is driving shells of strongly shocked gas into the halo of the host galaxy. In this context, we estimate Mach numbers M=2.7-3.6 and M=2.8-5.3 for the W and E shells respectively. We derive temperatures of 0.74 (+0.06, -0.05) keV and 0.8-1.8 keV for the W and E shells, and an expansion velocity of ~900-950 km/s. We estimate that the total energy (thermal and kinetic) involved in creating both shells is ~2x10^55 erg, and their age is ~10^6 years. Comparing these results with those we previously obtained for Centaurus A, NGC 3801 and Mrk 6, we show that these parameters scale approximately with the radio power of the parent AGN. The spatial coincidence between the X-ray and edge-brightened radio emission in Circinus resembles the morphology of some SNR shocks. This parallel has been expected for AGN, but has never been observed before. We investigate what underlying mechanisms both types of systems may have in common, arguing that, in Circinus, the edge-brightening in the shells may be accounted for by a B field enhancement caused by shock compression, but do not preclude some local particle acceleration.
