ESO 243-49 hosts the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) HLX-1, the strongest candidate intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) currently known with an estimated mass of\u223c 10,000 Msun. IMBHs may be the building blocks of supermassive black holes, and thus may play an important role in galaxy formation. The origin of IMBHs is unknown, however they may form in globular clusters or in the nuclei of dwarf galaxies. Through the requested observations we will search for signatures of a recent gas-rich merger event (such as tidal tails, a distorted HI disc, peculiar velocity field, and extra-planar gas) associated with the location of the IMBH. With this data we will test the hypothesis that HLX-1 is the stripped nucleus of a dwarf satellite \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4882F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
