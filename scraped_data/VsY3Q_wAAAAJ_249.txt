This project aims to search for new supernova remnants (SNRs) and monitor the structure and evolution of existing SNRs, to improve estimates of the nuclear supernova and star formation rates, and the spectral models of the SNRs. The sensitivity and resolution of these observations will enable a more accurate estimation on both upper and lower limits on these rates. From the models of supernova and star formation rates by Lenc & Tingay, it is clear that frequent, high sensitivity monitoring is required to maximise the chances of detecting remnants whose light curves peak briefly above the detection limits of VLBI images. Our observations will also enable a study of a jet-like structure at the nucleus of NGC4945, by measuring the spectral index of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4736R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
