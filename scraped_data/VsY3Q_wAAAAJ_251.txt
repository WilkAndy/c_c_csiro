This spiral galaxy is also peculiar in that it is radio-loud, with a pair of lobes spanning 7 kpc, and has a starburst ring and an ionisation cone. Our new deep (200 ks) Chandra data show, in a detail never achieved before for this kind of object, shells of shocked gas outside the radio lobes, with a temperature kT= 0.74^{+ 0.07} _ {-0.11} keV. Thanks to the exceptional spatial resolution achievable for Circinus, we have discovered that, unlike what has been observed in Centaurus A, the radio and X-ray emission in Circinus are spatially coincident, and notably edge-brightened, implying that we may be seeing the shock in radio (synchrotron) as well as in X-rays. This morphology is closely related to what is seen in SNR, and has been expected for AGN outflows, but it has never been observed before \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011sacm.confE..23M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
