This source appears to be a rare example of a ULIRG glimpsed in the brief period as it changes from \u201cquasar mode\u201d to \u201cradio mode\u201d activity. We have already detected the CO signal from this galaxy with the ATCA, and here propose to start a program of studies of the CO to pin down the dynamics and star formation processes in this object, to test models of the evolution of ULIRGs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4350N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
