We have analysed a short (25 ks) Chandra exposure and have found striking evidence for interaction between the radio lobes and large-scale features in the X-ray emitting gas. With this long exposure we will be able to determine physical conditions in the rims of the Eastern and Western lobes, and calculate temperatures and pressures for the external regions of the galaxy, to evaluate the shock conditions. These results will enable us to calculate the total energy output from the AGN, estimate the source lifetime and see how they relate to the current models of AGN and galaxy evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010cxo..prop.3165M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
