The new wide-field capabilities of the DiFX software correlator present the possibility of imaging the entire primary beam of a VLBI array, thus enabling a high resolution wide-field study of the entire galaxy. Using the VLBA and EVN, pilot observations of M31 have been carried out with the aim of using these new wide-field techniques to characterise the population of compact components at VLBI resolution both within and behind one of our nearest neighbours. This contribution describes the observations carried out, the preliminary processing and first results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5283", "cites_per_year": {}}
