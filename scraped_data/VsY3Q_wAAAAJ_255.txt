The upgrade results in a 16-fold increase in bandwidth at 6 cm, 3 cm and at millimetre wavelengths, while also providing 600 MHz at 20 cm and 500 MHz at 13 cm (simultaneous 20 cm and 13 cm observations are currently not available), see Figure 1. At all bands, full stokes and 1 MHz channels are available as standard, so in effect CABB has been delivering 8 GHz total bandwidth since normal operation began in April 2009 and thus has provided valuable experience for upcoming instruments such as the eVLA and eMERLIN."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pos.sissa.it/112/037/pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KauG9R6rzpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
