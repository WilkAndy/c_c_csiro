We report on the scientific achievements of ATLAS to date and plans to extend the project as a path finder for the proposed EMU (Evolutionary map of the Universe) project which has been designed to use ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CBY-J4kpSW0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
