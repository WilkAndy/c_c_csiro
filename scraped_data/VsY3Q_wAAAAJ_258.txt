Radio monitoring over the first 100 days after merger ruled out a simple (top-hat) off-axis jet and established that the panchromatic afterglow emission, as well as the \u03b3-rays, were produced in a mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow (Mooley et al. 2018b). Such an outflow could be explained by a cocoon (eg, Lazzati et al. 2017; Gottlieb et al. 2018) formed due to the interaction between an ultrarelativistic jet (as seen in SGRBs) and the merger dynamical/wind ejecta or due to the fast tail of the (fairly isotropic) dynamical ejecta. The afterglow emission peaked and started to decline approximately 160 days post-merger (Dobie et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2018; D\u2019Avanzo et al. 2018; Nynka et al. 2018; Troja et al. 2018). While the steeply declining light curve disfavored the isotropic ejecta model, the light curve and polarization measurements remained inconclusive as to whether a putative jet successfully penetrated the merger ejecta or was completely choked by it (eg, Margutti et al. 2018; Alexander et al. 2018; Corsi et al. 2018; Nakar & Piran 2018; Lamb et al. 2018). The degeneracy between the successful-and chokedjet models (eg Nakar et al. 2018; Gill & Granot 2018) was finally broken through the measurement of superluminal motion, at four times the speed of light between 75\u2013230 d post-merger, of the radio source using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)(Moo-"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/15904/8/The%20Panchromatic%20Afterglow%20of%20GW170817%20The%20Full%20Uniform%20Data%20Set%2C%20Modeling%2C%20Comparison%20with%20Previous%20Results%2C%20and%20Implications.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
