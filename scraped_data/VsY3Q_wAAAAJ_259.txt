The system is the nearest, radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) to our galaxy, and shows a wealth of structure on all scales and wavelengths at which it has been observed. In particular, the inner and middle radio lobes present an unrivalled opportunity to study how supermassive black holes transfer energy and material to the broader cosmos. Here, we present new radio observations of the inner radio lobes, taken with the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), spanning a frequency range of 747-1027 MHz and observed in full polarization. Previous work has been limited by being unable to resolve the polarization of the inner lobes of Cen A in detail over a broad frequency band. Radio polarimetry provides a means of calculating the magnetic field and determining the ratio of random to ordered components of the system. Qualitative observation of the rotation measure (RM) maps of the inner lobes reveal RM enhancement of a bow shock located in the Southwest (SW) inner lobe, previously only visible in X-ray frequencies. The RM analysis serves as a direct probe of the magnetic field strength, which we measured to be approximately 40\u03bcG. This value is substantially higher than previous estimates derived from X-ray observations, but our revised values remain too low for the shock front to act as an important source of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Furthermore, depolarized features within the inner lobes system are suggestive of the presence of one or more Faraday rotating regions along the line of sight to the radio source \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nrao.edu/students/2021/Reports/dePoloDonna.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:msco14tVWDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
