The survey has a 15.6 arcmin angular resolution and achieves a noise level of 15 mJy beam\u2212 1. We demonstrate a novel interferometric data analysis that involves calibration of drift scan data, integration through the co-addition of warped snapshot images, and deconvolution of the point-spread function through forward modeling. We present a point source catalog down to a flux limit of 4 Jy. We detect polarization from only one of the sources, PMN J0351-2744, at a level of 1.8%\u00b10.4%, whereas the remaining sources have a polarization fraction below 2%. Compared to a reported average value of 7% at 1.4 GHz, the polarization fraction of compact sources significantly decreases at low frequencies. We find a wealth of diffuse polarized emission across a large area of the survey with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14750982486641652215", "cites_id": ["14750982486641652215"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/771/2/105/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:97FI5GoEtswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 18, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
