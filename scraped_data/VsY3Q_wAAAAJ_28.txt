In this paper, we compare the outputs of multiple pipelines for the purpose of validating statistical limits cosmological hydrogen at redshifts between 6 and 12. Multiple independent data calibration and reduction pipelines are used to make power spectrum limits on a fiducial night of data. Comparing the outputs of imaging and power spectrum stages highlights differences in calibration, foreground subtraction, and power spectrum calculation. The power spectra found using these different methods span a space defined by the various tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and systematic control. Lessons learned from comparing the pipelines range from the algorithmic to the prosaically mundane; all demonstrate the many pitfalls of neglecting reproducibility. We briefly discuss the way these different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15920212498629594134", "cites_id": ["15920212498629594134"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/114/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FgyNKev079wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 14, "2018": 12, "2019": 25, "2020": 17, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
