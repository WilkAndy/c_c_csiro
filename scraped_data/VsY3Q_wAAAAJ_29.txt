A long-standing issue that has been seen here is significant instrumental Stokes leakage after calibration, particularly in Stokes Q at high frequencies. A simple model that accounts for interelement mutual coupling is presented which explains the prominence of Q leakage seen when the array is scanned away from zenith in the principal planes. On these planes, the model predicts current imbalance in the X (E-W) and Y (N-S) dipoles and hence the Q leakage. Although helpful in concept, we find that this model is inadequate to explain the full details of the observation data. This finding motivates further experimentation with more rigorous models that account for both mutual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7344854912519501016", "cites_id": ["7344854912519501016"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7771801/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2PSB06Aq7mUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 16, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
