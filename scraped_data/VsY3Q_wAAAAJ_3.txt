The SKA will be 50 times more sensitive than any existing radio facility. A majority of the key science for the SKA will be addressed through large-area imaging of the Universe at frequencies from 300 MHz to a few GHz. The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is aimed squarely in this frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phase-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. This large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope poised to achieve substantial advances in SKA key science. The central core of ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of the sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 562, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7088840304288910560", "cites_id": ["7088840304288910560"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10686-008-9124-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4MyczrKeYGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 19, "2010": 23, "2011": 43, "2012": 36, "2013": 33, "2014": 36, "2015": 36, "2016": 41, "2017": 29, "2018": 39, "2019": 50, "2020": 47, "2021": 61, "2022": 43, "2023": 20}}
