We begin with a heuristic formalism for understanding the mapping of sky coordinates into the cylindrically averaged power spectra measurements used by 21 cm experiments, with a focus on the effects of the instrument beam response and the associated sidelobes. We then demonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and observed data from the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that removing a foreground model that includes sources in both the main field of view and the first sidelobes reduces the contamination in high k\u2225 modes by several per cent relative to a model that only includes sources in the main field of view, with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=132146070560677805", "cites_id": ["132146070560677805"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/819/1/8/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rZ87qiZ61QEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 17, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 20, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
