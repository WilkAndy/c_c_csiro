This is due to the inherent response of a wide-field instrument and is characterized by enhanced power from foreground emission in Fourier modes adjacent to those considered to be the most sensitive to the cosmological H i signal. In our recent paper, many signatures from the simulation that predicted this feature were validated against Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) data, but this key pitchfork signature was close to the noise level. In this paper, we improve the data sensitivity through the coherent averaging of 12 independent snapshots with identical instrument settings and provide the first confirmation of the prediction with a signal-to-noise ratio . This wide-field effect can be mitigated by careful antenna \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17525381288242373826", "cites_id": ["17525381288242373826"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/807/2/L28/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wuT2nm2pNvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 23, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
