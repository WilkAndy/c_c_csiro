The data were taken as meridian drift scans with two different 32-antenna sub-arrays that were available during the commissioning period. The survey covers approximately 20.5 h < Right Ascension (RA) < 8.5 h, -58 deg < Declination (Dec) < -14 deg over three frequency bands centred on 119, 150 and 180 MHz, with image resolutions of 6--3 arcmin. The catalogue has 3-arcmin angular resolution and a typical noise level of 40 mJy/beam, with reduced sensitivity near the field boundaries and bright sources. We describe the data reduction strategy, based upon mosaiced snapshots, flux density calibration and source-finding method. We present a catalogue of flux density and spectral index measurements for 14,110 sources, extracted from the mosaic, 1,247 of which are sub-components of complexes of sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17224631323579661577", "cites_id": ["17224631323579661577"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0790", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CT0Ixe0uCu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 18, "2016": 25, "2017": 19, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
