PKS B0008-421 is characterized by the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, close to the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest known spectral width of any GPS source. Spectral coverage of the source spans from 0.118 to 22 GHz, which includes data from the Murchison Widefield Array and the wide bandpass receivers on the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have implemented a Bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data with internal free\u2013free absorption (FFA), single-and double-component FFA in an external homogeneous medium, FFA in an external inhomogeneous medium, or single-and double-component synchrotron self-absorption models, all with and without a high-frequency exponential break.
