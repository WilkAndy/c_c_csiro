The plasmasphere is believed to be embedded with cylindrical density structures (ducts) aligned along the Earth's magnetic field, but direct evidence for these remains scarce. Here we report the first direct wide\u2010angle observation of an extensive array of field\u2010aligned ducts bridging the upper ionosphere and inner plasmasphere, using a novel ground\u2010based imaging technique. We establish their heights and motions by feature tracking and parallax analysis. The structures are strikingly organized, appearing as regularly spaced, alternating tubes of overdensities and underdensities strongly aligned with the Earth's magnetic field. These findings represent the first direct visual evidence for the existence of such structures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6521720239449209404", "cites_id": ["6521720239449209404"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL063699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PHrYFAHOgVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
