The sensitivity available in our deep observations allows an in-band, frequency-dependent analysis of polarized structure for the first time at long wavelengths. Our analysis suggests that the polarized structures are dominated by intrinsic emission but may also have a foreground Faraday screen component. At these wavelengths, the compactness of the MWA baseline distribution provides excellent snapshot sensitivity to large-scale structure. The observations are sensitive to diffuse polarized emission at\u223c 54\u2032 resolution with a sensitivity of 5.9 mJy beam\u2212 1 and compact polarized sources at\u223c 2.\u2032 4 resolution with a sensitivity of 2.3 mJy beam\u2212 1 for a subset (400 deg 2) of this field. The sensitivity allows the effect of ionospheric Faraday rotation to be spatially and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6622742346121528010", "cites_id": ["6622742346121528010"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/830/1/38/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ysKCMxO16FsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 14, "2018": 22, "2019": 22, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
