This article empirically explores the effect of foreground spectra on EoR experiments by measuring high-resolution full-polarization spectra for the 586 brightest unresolved sources in one of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) EoR fields using 45 h of observation. A novel peeling scheme is used to subtract 2500 sources from the visibilities with ionospheric and beam corrections, resulting in the deepest, confusion-limited MWA image so far. The resulting spectra are found to be affected by instrumental effects, which limit the constraints that can be set on source-intrinsic spectral structure. The sensitivity and power-spectrum of the spectra are analysed, and it is found that the spectra of residuals are dominated by point spread function sidelobes from nearby \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13832555850777894869", "cites_id": ["13832555850777894869"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/458/1/1057/2622550", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1R9eHUIc978J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 10, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
