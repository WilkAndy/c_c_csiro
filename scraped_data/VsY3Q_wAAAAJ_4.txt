The catalogue covers 24\u2009831 square degrees, over declinations south of +30\u00b0 and Galactic latitudes outside 10\u00b0 of the Galactic plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds. It contains 307 455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72\u2013231 MHz, selected from a time- and frequency-integrated image centred at 200 MHz, with a resolution of \u22482\u2009arcmin. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the catalogue is 90 per cent complete at 170 mJy, and 50 per cent complete at 55 mJy, and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its reliability is 99.97 per \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 497, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13387950783755349020", "cites_id": ["13387950783755349020"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/464/1/1146/2280761", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HGwmME6Oy7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 38, "2018": 79, "2019": 99, "2020": 65, "2021": 92, "2022": 83, "2023": 35}}
