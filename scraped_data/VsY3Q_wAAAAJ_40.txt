The new X-ray data have a factor of 4 more exposure than observations previously presented and span a 15 yr time baseline, allowing a detailed study of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of the AGN, jet, hotspot and lobes. We present evidence for further time variation of the jet, though the flare that we reported in previous work remains the most significantly detected time-varying feature. We also confirm previous tentative evidence for a faint counterjet. Based on the radio through X-ray spectrum of the jet and its detailed spatial structure, and on the properties of the counterjet, we argue that inverse-Compton models can be conclusively rejected, and propose that the X-ray emission from the jet is synchrotron emission from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3668789505453317509", "cites_id": ["3668789505453317509"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/455/4/3526/1266169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hd05_J0o6jIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 13, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
