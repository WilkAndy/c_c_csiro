Six sources were detected, all corresponding to sources identified in higher frequency (> 5 GHz) VLA images. One of the sources, supernova remnant 5.48-43.3, is resolved into a shell-like structure approximately 90 mas (1.7 pc) in diameter. From these data and data from the literature, the spectra of 20 compact radio sources in NGC 253 were modeled and found to be consistent with free-free absorbed power laws. Broadly, the free-free opacity is highest toward the nucleus but varies significantly throughout the nuclear region (\u03c4 0\u223c 1 to> 20), implying that the overall structure of the ionized medium is clumpy. Of the 20 sources, 9 have flat intrinsic spectra associated with thermal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17559684307130904507", "cites_id": ["17559684307130904507"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/506475/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u--JlteHsPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
