These data combine the observations at 1.4\u2009GHz before and after upgrades to the Australia Telescope Compact Array reaching a sensitivity of 14\u2009\u03bcJy beam\u22121 in 3.6 deg2 over the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and of 17\u2009\u03bcJy beam\u22121 in 2.7 deg2 over the European Large Area ISO Survey South 1 (ELAIS-S1). We used a variety of array configurations to maximize the uv coverage resulting in a resolution of 16 by 7 arcsec in CDFS and of 12 by 8 arcsec in ELAIS-S1. After correcting for peak bias and bandwidth smearing, we find a total of 3034 radio source components above 5\u03c3 in CDFS, of which 514 (17 per cent) are considered to be extended. The number of components detected above 5\u03c3 in ELAIS-S1 is 2084, of which 392 (19 per cent) are classified as extended. The catalogues include reliable spectral indices (\u0394\u03b1 < 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8382424333030247158", "cites_id": ["8382424333030247158"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/453/4/4020/2593691", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9srb1oRaVHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 12, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
