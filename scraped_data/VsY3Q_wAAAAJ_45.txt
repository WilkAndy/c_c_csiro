We use two versions of the radio image covering 2176 \u00d7 2176 with point sources brighter than 0.05\u2009Jy subtracted, with and without filtering of Galactic emission. As tracers of the LSS, we use the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Wide-field InfraRed Explorer redshift catalogues to produce galaxy number density maps. The cross-correlation functions all show peak amplitudes at 0\u00b0, decreasing with varying slopes towards zero correlation over a range of 1\u00b0. The cross-correlation signals include components from point source, Galactic, and extragalactic diffuse emission. We use models of the diffuse emission from smoothing the density maps with Gaussians of sizes 1\u20134 Mpc to find limits on the cosmic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4917121700096314374", "cites_id": ["4917121700096314374"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/467/4/4914/3038252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BgybWyIgPUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 8}}
