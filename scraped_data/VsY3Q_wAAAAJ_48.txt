The survey uses the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to cover 30\u2009900 sq deg, over declinations south of +30\u00b0 and north of \u221286\u00b0 centred at 200\u2009MHz (over a 169\u2013231\u2009MHz band). We achieve a spatial resolution of \u223c3 arcmin and a typical sensitivity of 3.0\u2009mJy\u2009PSF\u22121 over most of the survey region. We demonstrate a new leakage mitigation technique that reduces the leakage from total intensity into circular polarization by an order of magnitude. In a blind survey of the imaged region, we detect 14 pulsars in circular polarization above a 6\u03c3 threshold. We also detect six transient sources associated with artificial satellites. A targeted survey of \u20092376 pulsars within the surveyed region yielded 33 detections above 4\u03c3. Looking specifically at pulsars previously detected at 200 MHz in total intensity, this represents a 35\u2009per\u2009cent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16418256851582858432", "cites_id": ["16418256851582858432"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/478/2/2835/4999917", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wDS4bZ5d2eMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 20, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
