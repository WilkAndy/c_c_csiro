The MWA is the low-frequency precursor to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and is the first of three SKA precursors to be operational, supporting a varied science mission ranging from the attempted detection of the Epoch of Reionization to the monitoring of solar flares and space weather. In this paper we explore the possibility that the MWA can be used for the purposes of Space Situational Awareness (SSA). In particular we propose that the MWA can be used as an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5\u2013108 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast band). In this scenario the MWA can be considered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM broadcast stations serving as non-cooperative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4374430103490236826", "cites_id": ["4374430103490236826"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/146/4/103/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mpFPnQAZtTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 5}}
