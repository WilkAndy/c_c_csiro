We imaged a 30 deg 2 field at \u0394T= 2, 9, and 33 days post-merger at a frequency of 944 MHz, comparing them to reference images from the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey observed 110 days prior to the event. Each epoch of our observations covers 89% of the LIGO/Virgo localization region. We conducted an untargeted search for radio transients in this field, resulting in 21 candidates. For one of these, AT2019osy, we performed multiwavelength follow-up and ultimately ruled out the association with S190814bv. All other candidates are likely unrelated variables, but we cannot conclusively rule them out. We discuss our results in the context of model predictions for radio emission from NSBH mergers and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9301683671098003360", "cites_id": ["9301683671098003360"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab59db/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oA_ZNAQ4FoEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 15, "2021": 16, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
