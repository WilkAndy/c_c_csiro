The proximity of Circinus allows us to observe in striking detail the structure of the radio lobes, revealing for the first time edge-brightened emission in both X-rays and radio. After considering various other possible scenarios, we show that this extended emission in Circinus is most likely caused by a jet-driven outflow, which is driving shells of strongly shocked gas into the halo of the host galaxy. In this context, we estimate Mach numbers \u20133.6 and \u20135.3 for the W and E shells, respectively. We derive temperatures of 0.74+ 0.06\u2212 0.05 keV and 0.8\u20131.8 keV for the W and E shells and an expansion velocity of\u223c 900\u2013950 km s\u2212 1. We estimate that the total energy (thermal and kinetic) involved in creating both shells \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10215160427048867609", "cites_id": ["10215160427048867609"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/758/2/95/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GRfgQUmKw40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 12, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
