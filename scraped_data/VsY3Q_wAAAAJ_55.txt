A3667 is one of the best known examples of a galaxy cluster hosting a double radio relic and has been reported to contain a faint radio halo and bridge. The origin of radio haloes, relics and bridges is still unclear, however galaxy cluster merger seems to be an important factor. We clearly detect the north-west (NW) and south-east radio relics in A3667 and find an integrated flux density at 149\u2009MHz of 28.1 \u00b1 1.7 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.1\u2009Jy, respectively, with an average spectral index, between 120 and 1400\u2009MHz, of \u22120.9 \u00b1 0.1 for both relics. We find evidence of a spatial variation in the spectral index across the NW relic steepening towards the centre of the cluster, which indicates an ageing electron population. These properties are consistent with higher frequency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11030392770734432067", "cites_id": ["11030392770734432067"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/445/1/330/985956", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q5-pkMjTE5kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
