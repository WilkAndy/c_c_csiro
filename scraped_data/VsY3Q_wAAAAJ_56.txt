DR2 improves upon the first data release by maintaining consistent data reductions across the two regions, including polarization analysis, and including differential number counts in total intensity and linear polarization. Typical DR2 sensitivities across the mosaicked multipointing images are 30 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 at approximately 12\u2009arcsec \u00d7 6\u2009arcsec resolution over a combined area of 6.4 deg2. In this paper we present detailed descriptions of our data reduction and analysis procedures, including corrections for instrumental effects such as positional variations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=476921717488712571", "cites_id": ["476921717488712571"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/441/3/2555/1106756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e3uVdMZdngYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
