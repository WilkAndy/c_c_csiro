In this paper, we develop a model for the compact foreground sources in one of the target fields of the MWA\u2019s EoR key science experiment: the \u2018EoR1\u2019 field. The model is based on both the MWA\u2019s GLEAM survey and GMRT 150 MHz data from the TGSS survey, the latter providing higher angular resolution and better astrometric accuracy for compact sources than is available from the MWA alone. The model contains 5 049 sources, some of which have complicated morphology in MWA data, Fornax A being the most complex. The higher resolution data show that 13% of sources that appear point-like to the MWA have complicated morphology such as double and quad structure, with a typical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4170510855461328255", "cites_id": ["4170510855461328255"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/highresolution-foreground-model-for-the-mwa-eor1-field-model-and-implications-for-eor-power-spectrum-analysis/E20D955FC00BA9968AFCDD71094C3455", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f9Wu14ah4DkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
