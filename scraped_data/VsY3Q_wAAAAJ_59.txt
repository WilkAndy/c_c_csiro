This sample includes 13 systems that have not previously been targeted with radio observations. We detected no radio emission at 154 MHz, and put 3\u03c3 upper limits in the range 15.2\u2013112.5 mJy on this emission. We also searched for circularly polarized emission and made no detections, obtaining 3\u03c3 upper limits in the range 3.4\u201349.9 mJy. These are comparable with the best low-frequency radio limits in the existing literature and translate to luminosity limits of between 1.2 \u00d7 1014 and 1.4 \u00d7 1017 W if the emission is assumed to be 100\u2009per\u2009cent circularly polarized. These are the first results from a larger program to systematically search for exoplanetary emission with the MWA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1393253615607317547", "cites_id": ["1393253615607317547"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/3/2560/2892420", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K4RNGMjUVRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 13, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 3}}
