Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We report the detection of radio emission at the location of HLX-1 during its hard X-ray state using the ATCA. Assuming that the \u2018Fundamental Plane\u2019 of accreting black holes is applicable, we provide an independent estimate of the black hole mass of  M\u2299 at 90\u2009per\u2009cent confidence. However, we argue that the detected radio emission is likely to be Doppler-boosted and our mass estimate is an upper limit. We discuss other possible origins of the radio emission such as being due to a radio nebula, star formation, or later interaction of the flares with the large-scale environment. None of these were found adequate. The VLA observations were carried out during the X-ray outburst. However, no new radio flare was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17460245568869445917", "cites_id": ["17460245568869445917"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/4/3268/2892791", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HTGNJ9ZAT_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
