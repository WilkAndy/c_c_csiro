The survey area consists of two overlapping 28 deg 2 fields centered on the quasar J0226+ 3421 and the gravitational lens B0218+ 357. A total of 618 sources were targeted in these fields, based on identifications from Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) data. Of these sources, 272 had flux densities that, if unresolved, would fall above the sensitivity limit of the VLBI observations. A total of 27 sources were detected as far as 2 from the phase center. The results of the survey suggest that at least 10% of moderately faint (S\\sim 100 mJy) sources found at 90 cm contain compact components smaller than\u223c 0.1''-0.3''and stronger than 10% of their total flux densities. A\u223c 90 mJy source was detected in the VLBI data that was not seen in the WENSS and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data and may be a transient or highly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16312424468311302733", "cites_id": ["16312424468311302733"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/524295/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TeIVg6BfYeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 9, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
