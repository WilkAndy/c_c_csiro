FRB 191001 was detected at a dispersion measure (DM) of 506.92 (4) pc cm\u2212 3 and its measured fluence of 143 (15) Jy ms is the highest of the bursts localized to host galaxies by ASKAP to date. The subarcsecond localization of the FRB provided by ASKAP reveals that the burst originated in the outskirts of a highly star-forming spiral in a galaxy pair at redshift z= 0.2340 (1). Radio observations show no evidence for a compact persistent radio source associated with the FRB 191001 above a flux density of 15 \u03bcJy. However, we detect diffuse synchrotron radio emission from the disk of the host galaxy that we ascribe to ongoing star formation. FRB 191001 was also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5906727842834678833", "cites_id": ["5906727842834678833"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abb462/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MQQSia3p-FEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 17, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
