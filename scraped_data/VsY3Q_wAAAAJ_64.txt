Using a Bayesian framework, we find the radio continuum is rarely characterized well by a single power law, instead often exhibiting low-frequency turnovers below 500\u2009MHz, steepening at mid to high frequencies, and a flattening at high frequencies where free\u2013free emission begins to dominate over the synchrotron emission. These higher order curvature components may be attributed to free\u2013free absorption across multiple regions of star formation with varying optical depths. The decomposed synchrotron and free\u2013free emission components in our sample of galaxies form strong correlations with the total-infrared bolometric luminosities. Finally, we find that without \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17898807772690106562", "cites_id": ["17898807772690106562"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/474/1/779/4411835", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wsgxWtZWZfgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 12, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
