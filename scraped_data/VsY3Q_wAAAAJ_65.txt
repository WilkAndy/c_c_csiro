This image provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object to date, the maximum angular resolution of 23 mas corresponding to a spatial resolution of 16 pc, more than three times better than previous VLBI observations of similar objects. The northwest Pictor A hot spot is resolved into a complex set of compact components, seen to coincide with the bright part of the hot spot imaged at arcsecond-scale resolution with the Very Large Array (VLA). In addition to a comparison with VLA data, we compare our VLBA results with data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra telescopes, as well as new Spitzer data.
