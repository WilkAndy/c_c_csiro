Fifteen sources were detected, 13 of which correspond to sources identified in higher frequency (3 cm and 12 mm) Australian Telescope Compact Array images. Four of the sources are resolved into shell-like structures ranging between 60 and 110 mas (1.1 to 2.1 pc) in diameter. From these data the spectra of 13 compact radio sources in NGC 4945 were modelled; nine were found to be consistent with free-free absorbed power laws and four with a simple power law spectrum. The free-free opacity is highest toward the nucleus but significantly varies throughout the nuclear region (\u03c4 0\u223c 6\u2212 23), implying that the overall structure of the ionized medium is clumpy.
