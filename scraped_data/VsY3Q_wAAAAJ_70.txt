We present a catalogue of 7394 extragalactic sources at 182 MHz detected in the RA = 0 field of the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionization observation programme. Motivated by unprecedented requirements for precision and reliability we develop new methods for source finding and selection. We apply machine learning methods to self-consistently classify the relative reliability of 9490 source candidates. A subset of 7466 are selected based on reliability class and signal-to-noise ratio criteria. These are statistically cross-matched to four other radio surveys using both position and flux density information. We find 7369 sources to have confident matches, including 90 partially resolved sources that split into a total of 192 sub \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5681305207672179381", "cites_id": ["5681305207672179381"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/461/4/4151/2608728", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tYrgS_wM2E4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 10, "2018": 2, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
