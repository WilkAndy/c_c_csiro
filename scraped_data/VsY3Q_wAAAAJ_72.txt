However, the new generation of low-frequency telescopes, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (the precursor for the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array) offers an opportunity to probe the physics of radio sources at very low radio frequencies. In this paper, we present a catalogue of linearly polarised sources detected at 216 MHz, using data from the Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array survey. Our catalogue covers the Declination range \u201317\u00b0 to \u201337\u00b0 and 24 h in Right Ascension, at a resolution of around 3 arcminutes. We detect 81 sources (including both a known pulsar and a new pulsar candidate) with linearly polarised flux densities in excess of 18 mJy across a survey area of approximately 6 400 deg2, corresponding to a surface density of 1 source per \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14355456169908083351", "cites_id": ["14355456169908083351"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/polarised-gleam-survey-pogs-i-first-results-from-a-lowfrequency-radio-linear-polarisation-survey-of-the-southern-sky/4B9B5B7A2DF3E3E04F6ADD99F48E21AB", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l5oP_FPTOMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 7}}
