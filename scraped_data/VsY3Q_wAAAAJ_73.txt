In this work, we empirically assess the effects of the ionosphere on data taken by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope. We directly examine 51 h of data observed over 10 nights under quiet geomagnetic conditions (global storm index Kp < 2), analysing the behaviour of short-time-scale angular position and peak flux density variations of around ten thousand unresolved sources. We find that while much of the variation in angular position can be attributed to ionospheric refraction, the characteristic displacements (10\u201320 arcsec) at 154 MHz are small enough that search radii of 1\u20132 arcmin should be sufficient for cross \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2938240198671445281", "cites_id": ["2938240198671445281"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/453/3/2731/1750400", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ia2VquS5xigJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 14, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
