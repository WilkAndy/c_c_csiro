The feature was not detected in a follow-up observation in 2009. The jet itself is over 150 kpc long and about 1 kpc wide, so finding year-long variability is surprising. Assuming a synchrotron origin of the observed high-energy photons and a minimum energy condition for the outflow, the synchrotron loss time of the X-ray emitting electrons is of order 1200 years, which is much longer than the observed variability timescale. This leads to the possibility that the variable X-ray emission arises from a very small sub-volume of the jet, characterized by a magnetic field that is substantially larger than the average over the jet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15576513986963656381", "cites_id": ["15576513986963656381"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/714/2/L213/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vU7fd_HkKtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
