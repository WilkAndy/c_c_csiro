Although we detected all previously reported intervening systems towards PKS B1830\u2212211, in the case of MG J0414+0534, three systems were not found, indicating that the original identifications may have been confused with radio frequency interference. Given the sensitivity of our data, we find that our detection yield is consistent with the expected frequency of intervening H\u2009i systems estimated from previous surveys for 21-cm emission in nearby galaxies and z \u223c 3 damped Lyman \u03b1 absorbers. We find spectral variability in the z = 0.886 face-on spiral galaxy towards PKS B1830\u2212211 from observations undertaken with the Westerbork Synthesis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8775272788557714890", "cites_id": ["8775272788557714890"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/465/4/4450/2447818", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ylUimRsIyHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
