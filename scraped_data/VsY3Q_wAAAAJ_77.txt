The flares have flux densities between 10 and 65 mJy\u2014a factor of 100 fainter than most flares in the literature at these frequencies\u2014and are only detected in polarization. The circular polarized fractions are limited to % at 3\u03c3 confidence and two of the flares exhibit polarity reversal. We suggest that these flares occur periodically on a timescale consistent with the rotational period of UV Ceti. During the brightest observed flare, we also detect significant linear polarization with a polarization fraction %. Averaging the data in 6 minute, 10 MHz frequency bins we find that the flux density of these flares does not vary over the 30 MHz bandwidth of the Murchison Widefield Array; however, we cannot rule out finer time-frequency structure. Using the measured flux densities for the flares, we estimate brightness temperatures between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13230184540490947723", "cites_id": ["13230184540490947723"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa5ffd/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i9zTOL4Om7cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
