However, coherent bursts from active M dwarfs have often been difficult to interpret in the solar activity paradigm. We present Australian Square Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations of UV Ceti at a central frequency of 888 MHz. We detect several periodic, coherent pulses occurring over a time-scale consistent with the rotational period of UV Ceti. The properties of the pulsed emission show that they originate from the electron cyclotron maser instability, in a cavity at least 7 orders of magnitude less dense than the mean coronal density at the estimated source altitude. These results confirm that auroral activity can occur in active M dwarfs, suggesting that these stars mark the beginning of the transition from solar-like to auroral magnetospheric behaviour \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6273480877067413620", "cites_id": ["6273480877067413620"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/488/1/559/5525090", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dCjPjp7hD1cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
