Radio emission directly traces the planetary magnetic fields and radio detections can place constraints on the physical parameters of these features. Large comparative studies of predicted radio emission characteristics for the known population of exoplanets help to identify what physical parameters could be the key for producing bright, observable radio emission. Since the last comparative study, many thousands of exoplanets have been discovered. We report new estimates for the radio flux densities and maximum emission frequencies for the current population of known exoplanets orbiting pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars with spectral types F-M. The set of exoplanets predicted to produce observable radio emission are Hot Jupiters orbiting young stars. The youth of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11722896014193438705", "cites_id": ["11722896014193438705"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/478/2/1763/4992335", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8a_XeNAXsKIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 7}}
