It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been proposed that the observed \u03b3-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight (off-axis),,,. The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-\u03b3-ray bursts,. Here we report that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet directed away from the line of sight, the observed \u03b3-ray emission could not have originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 356, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1693163075724194963", "cites_id": ["1693163075724194963"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25452", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kzRZu9hSfxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 96, "2019": 92, "2020": 47, "2021": 53, "2022": 48, "2023": 16}}
