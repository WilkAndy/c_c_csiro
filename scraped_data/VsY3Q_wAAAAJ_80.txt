We model the broadband radio spectral energy distribution for the total flux density of NGC 253 between 76 MHz and 11 GHz. The spectrum is best described as a sum of a central starburst and extended emission. The central component, corresponding to the inner 500 pc of the starburst region of the galaxy, is best modeled as an internally free\u2013free absorbed synchrotron plasma, with a turnover frequency around 230 MHz. The extended emission component of the spectrum of NGC 253 is best described as a synchrotron emission flattening at low radio frequencies. We find that 34% of the extended emission (outside the central starburst region) at 1 GHz becomes partially absorbed at low radio frequencies. Most of this flattening occurs in the western region of the southeast halo \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6866267754054494422", "cites_id": ["6866267754054494422"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa5f5d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1igjrSTiSV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
