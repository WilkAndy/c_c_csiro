Spectral indices are an important tool for understanding the emission mechanism of the faint radio sources. We have observed the extended Chandra Deep Field South at 5.5 GHz using a mosaic of 42 pointings with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Our image reaches an almost uniform sensitivity of \u223c12 \u03bcJy rms over 0.25\u2009deg2 with a restoring beam of 4.9\u2009arcsec \u00d7 2.0\u2009arcsec, making ATLAS 5.5\u2009GHz survey one of the deepest 6 cm surveys to date. We present the 5.5 GHz catalogue and source counts from this field. We take advantage of the large amount of ancillary data in this field to study the 1.4 to 5.5 GHz spectral indices of the sub-mJy population.
