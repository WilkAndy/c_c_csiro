Here we present a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)_ image which shows a compact core\u2013jet active galactic nucleus (AGN) in its core, with a radio luminosity (L2.3\u2003GHz= 6 \u00d7 1025 W Hz\u22121) typical of powerful radio galaxies. Although already radio loud, the quasar jets are only 1.7\u2003kpc long, boring through the dense gas and starburst activity that confine them. This source therefore appears to be powered by a combination of a compact radio-loud AGN surrounded by vigorous starburst activity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8362734097711392178", "cites_id": ["8362734097711392178"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/422/2/1453/1036767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:smUirVpmDnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
