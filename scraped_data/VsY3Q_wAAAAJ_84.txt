In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of> 1000 and> 14,000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Surprisingly, optical emission associated with the event peaks at a much lower level with a time delay. The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for< \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15103660314849766428", "cites_id": ["15103660314849766428"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abf14c/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HOzIogj7mtEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
