However, a renaissance in low-frequency polarimetry has been enabled by pathfinder and precursor instruments for the Square Kilometre Array. In this second paper from the POlarised GaLactic and Extragalactic All-Sky MWA Survey-the POlarised GLEAM Survey, or POGS-we present the results from our all-sky MWA Phase I Faraday Rotation Measure survey. Our survey covers nearly the entire Southern sky in the Declination range rad m\u22122. The Faraday rotation measures are broadly consistent with results from higher-frequency surveys, but with typically more than an order of magnitude improvement in the precision, highlighting the power of low-frequency polarisation surveys to accurately study Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields. We discuss the properties of our extragalactic and known-pulsar source population, how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18415805236621016630", "cites_id": ["18415805236621016630"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/polarised-gleam-survey-pogs-ii-results-from-an-allsky-rotation-measure-synthesis-survey-at-long-wavelengths/99511EEEEBA1DF49F141031BC85AE5A7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nv6SpUoVkv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
