These images are the first of their kind, and we introduce an algorithm to mitigate an instrumental artifact by which the total intensity signal contaminates the polarimetric images due to calibration errors. We then survey the range of circular polarization (Stokes ) features detected in over 100 observing runs near solar maximum during quiescent periods. First, we detect around 700 compact polarized sources across our dataset with polarization fractions ranging from less than 0.5% to nearly 100%. These sources exhibit a positive correlation between polarization fraction and total intensity, and we interpret them as a continuum of plasma emission noise storm (Type I burst) continua sources associated with active regions.
