By compiling all archival data and reprocessing a subset of it, we have evaluated the impact of differences in data processing or flux determination methods used by different groups and attempted to mitigate these differences to provide a more uniform data set. Simple power-law fits to the uniform afterglow light curve indicate a t 0.86\u00b10.04 rise, a t\u2212 1.92\u00b10.12 decline, and a peak occurring at 155\u00b14 days. The afterglow is optically thin throughout its evolution, consistent with a single spectral index (\u2212 0.584\u00b10.002) across all epochs. This gives a precise and updated estimate of the electron power-law index, p= 2.168\u00b10.004. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission from the host galaxy, we place a conservative upper limit on the hot ionized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12824202954494534111", "cites_id": ["12824202954494534111"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1ffc/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:32EpPqS4-LEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
