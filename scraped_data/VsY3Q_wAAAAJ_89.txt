This can be traced by both 21 cm H\u2009i absorption and soft X-ray absorption, offering new insight into the physical nature of the circumnuclear medium of these distant galaxies. To better understand this relationship, we investigate soft X-ray absorption as an indicator for the detection of associated H\u2009i absorption, as part of preparation for the First Large Absorption Survey in H\u2009i to be undertaken with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We present the results of our pilot study using the Boolardy Engineering Test Array, a precursor to ASKAP, to search for new absorption detections in radio sources brighter than 1 Jy that also feature soft X-ray absorption. Based on this pilot survey, we detected H\u2009i absorption towards the radio source PKS 1657\u2212298 at a redshift of z = 0.42. This source also features the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17253531969310756813", "cites_id": ["17253531969310756813"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/471/3/2952/3930854", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zQ-dt-nbcO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
