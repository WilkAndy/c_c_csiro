RACS is a survey of the entire sky south of \u03b4 = +41\u25cb being conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope (ASKAP) over a 288\u2009MHz wide band centred on 887.5\u2009MHz. The data we analyse include Stokes I and V polarization products to an RMS sensitivity of 250\u2009\u03bcJy\u2009PSF\u22121. We searched RACS for sources with fractional circular polarization above 6 per cent, and after excluding imaging artefacts, polarization leakage, and known pulsars we identified radio emission coincident with 33 known stars. These range from M-dwarfs through to magnetic, chemically peculiar A- and B-type stars. Some of these are well-known radio stars such as YZ CMi and CU Vir, but 23 have no previous radio detections. We report the flux density and derived brightness temperature of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15072497738192597115", "cites_id": ["15072497738192597115"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/4/5438/6129319", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ezDZ2tVELNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 18, "2023": 4}}
