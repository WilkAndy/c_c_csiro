We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to observe a new 198 pointing mosaic, covering 3\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0, and present the highest-sensitivity full-Stokes data of W50 to date using wide-field, wide-band imaging over a 2 GHz bandwidth centred at 2.1 GHz. We also present a complementary H\u03b1 mosaic created using the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H\u03b1 Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane. The magnetic structure of W50 is consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that the nebula is a reanimated shell-like supernova remnant (SNR), which has been re-energized by the jets from SS433. We observe strong depolarization effects that correlate with diffuse H\u03b1 emission, likely due to spatially varying Faraday rotation measure (RM) fluctuations of \u226548\u201361 rad m\u22122 on scales \u22644.5\u20136 pc. We also report the discovery of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1428361351722321109", "cites_id": ["1428361351722321109"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/467/4/4777/3045397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1URO5BSP0hMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
