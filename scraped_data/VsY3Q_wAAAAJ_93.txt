Because interferometers are not sensitive to a spatially invariant global average, they cannot be used to detect this signal using standard techniques. However, lunar occultation of the radio sky imprints a spatial structure on the global signal, allowing us to measure the average brightness temperature of the patch of sky immediately surrounding the Moon. In this paper, we present one night of Moon observations with the MWA between 72\u2013230 MHz and verify our techniques to extract the background sky temperature from measurements of the Moon\u2019s flux density. We improve upon previous work using the lunar occultation technique by using a more sophisticated model for reflected \u2018earthshine\u2019 and by employing image \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15639780925494205966", "cites_id": ["15639780925494205966"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/481/4/5034/5091824", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dh4DfeOpC9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
