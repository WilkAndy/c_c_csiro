The first-order ionosphere manifests itself as a bulk position shift of the observed sources across an MWA field of view. These effects can be computed from global ionosphere maps provided by GPS analysis centres, namely the CODE. However, for precision radio astronomy applications, data from local GPS networks needs to be incorporated into ionospheric modelling. For GPS observations, the ionospheric parameters are biased by GPS receiver instrument delays, among other effects, also known as receiver DCBs. The receiver DCBs need to be estimated for any non-CODE GPS station used for ionosphere modelling. In this work, single GPS station-based ionospheric modelling is performed at a time resolution of 10 min. Also the receiver DCBs are estimated for selected Geoscience Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=928569012087902592", "cites_id": ["928569012087902592"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/ionospheric-modelling-using-gps-to-calibrate-the-mwa-i-comparison-of-first-order-ionospheric-effects-between-gps-models-and-mwa-observations/5AD4292C5D6A5C2CA7D63EE0F039E99F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gFHvwpjw4gwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
