The images used for this study were obtained from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey which was carried out at five frequencies, viz. 88, 118, 154, 188 and 215 MHz. We detect diffuse radio emission in eight of these clusters. We have estimated the spectra of haloes and relics in these clusters over the frequency range 80\u20131400 MHz; the first such attempt to estimate their spectra at low frequencies. The spectra follow a power law with a mean value of \u03b1 = \u22121.13 \u00b1 0.21 for haloes and \u03b1 = \u22121.2 \u00b1 0.19 for relics, where S \u221d \u03bd\u03b1. We reclassify two of the cluster sources as radio galaxies. The low-frequency spectra are thus an independent means of confirming the nature of cluster sources. Five of the nine clusters host radio haloes. For the remaining four clusters, we place upper \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16520983151849202111", "cites_id": ["16520983151849202111"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/467/1/936/2929280", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v2EvCqVSRuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 4}}
