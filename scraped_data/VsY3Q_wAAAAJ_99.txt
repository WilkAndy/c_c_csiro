In this paper, we propose a general method, based on the delay spectrum approach, to extract H i power spectra that are applicable to tracking observations using an imaging radio interferometer (\" Delay Spectrum with Imaging Arrays\"). Our method is based on modeling the H i signal taking into account the impact of wide field effects such as the w-term, which are then used as appropriate weights in cross-correlating the measured visibilities. Our method is applicable to any radio interferometer that tracks a phase center and could be utilized for arrays such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), and HERA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "VsY3Q_wAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1976024786014265023", "cites_id": ["1976024786014265023"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/213/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v16_zRJAbBsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
