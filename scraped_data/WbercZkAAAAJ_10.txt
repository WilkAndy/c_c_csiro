We developed Australia\u2010wide 0.01\u00b0 resolution daily u grids by interpolating measurements from an expanded anemometer network for 1975\u20132006. These new grids represented the magnitude and spatial\u2010variability of observed u trends, whereas grids from reanalysis systems (NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE and ERA40) essentially did not, even when minimising the sea\u2010breeze impact. For these new grids, the Australian\u2010averaged u trend for 1975\u20132006 was \u22120.009 m s\u22121 a\u22121 (agreeing with earlier site\u2010based studies) with stilling over 88% of the land\u2010surface.
