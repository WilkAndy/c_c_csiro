If evapotranspiration (Et) is reduced, it may subsequently increase soil water storage (\u0394S) or surface runoff (R) and drainage (Dg), although these could be offset or even reversed by changes in vegetation structure, mainly increased leaf area index (L). To understand the effect of eCa in a water\u2010limited ecosystem, we tested whether 2 years of eCa (~40% increase) affected the hydrological partitioning in a mature water\u2010limited Eucalyptus woodland exposed to Free\u2010Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE). This timeframe allowed us to evaluate whether physiological effects of eCa reduced stand water\u2010use irrespective of L, which was unaffected by eCa in this timeframe. We hypothesized that eCa would \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12707309372870883291", "cites_id": ["12707309372870883291"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2_f1ZIxuWbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 12, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
