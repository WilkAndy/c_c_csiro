How canopy\u2010level transpiration and assimilation fluxes respond to increased \u03c9 is currently unclear. We present a simple, resource\u2010availability\u2010based hypothesis of how equilibrium (or mature) leaf and canopy transpiration and assimilation rates, along with leaf area index (L), respond to elevated CO2. We quantify this hypothesis in the form of a model and test it against observations from eight Free Air CO2 Enrichment sites that span a wide range of resource availabilities. Sites were grouped according to vegetation disturbance status. We find the model adequately accounts for the responses of undisturbed vegetation (R2\u2009=\u20090.73, 11% error) but cannot account for the responses of disturbed vegetation (R2\u2009=\u20090.47, 17% error). At undisturbed sites, the responses of L and of leaf and canopy transpiration vary predictably (7% error) with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6565251883174112387", "cites_id": ["6565251883174112387"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JG003505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g6yOtc11HFsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
