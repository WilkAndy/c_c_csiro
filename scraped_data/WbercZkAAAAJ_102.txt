Actual GPP (climatological mean from 1982 to 2010) is calculated as a function of the balance between two GPP potentials defined by the climate (i.e., precipitation and solar radiation) and a third parameter that encodes other environmental variables and modifies the GPP\u2010climate relationship. The model was tested using observed GPP from 94 flux sites and modeled GPP (using the model tree ensemble approach) at 48,654 (0.5\u00b0) grid cells globally. Results show that the model could account for the spatial GPP patterns, with a root\u2010mean\u2010square error of 0.70 and 0.65\u2009g\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009d\u22121 and R2 of 0.79 and 0.92 for the flux site and grid cell scales, respectively. This analytical GPP model shares a similar form with the Budyko hydroclimatological model, which opens the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14313775019458039810", "cites_id": ["14313775019458039810"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015gl066835", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AhCo5Yq-pMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 1, "2023": 5}}
