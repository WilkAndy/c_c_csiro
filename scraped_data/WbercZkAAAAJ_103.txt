Climate model outputs project an increase in drought frequency and severity by the end of the 21st century. However, there is a large uncertainty related to the extent of the global land area that will be impacted by enhanced climatological and hydrological droughts. Although climate metrics suggest a likely strong increase in future drought severity, hydrologic metrics do not show a similar signal. In the literature, numerous attempts have been made to explain these differences using several physical mechanisms. This study provides evidence that characterization of drought from different statistical perspectives can lead to unreliable detection of climatological/hydrological droughts in model projections and accordingly give a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d of the impacts of future climate change. In particular, this study analyses future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16198447801541103010", "cites_id": ["16198447801541103010"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.6350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oo2Q03NyzOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 11, "2023": 10}}
