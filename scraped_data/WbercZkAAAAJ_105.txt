We developed a simple temperature domain two\u2010source energy balance (TD\u2010TSEB) model within a hybrid two\u2010source model scheme by coupling \u201clayer\u201d and \u201cpatch\u201d models to estimate surface heat fluxes from Landsat thematic mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) imagery. For estimating latent heat flux (LE) of full soil, we proposed a temperature domain residual of the energy balance equation based on a simplified framework of total aerodynamic resistances, which provides a key link between thermal satellite temperature and subsurface moisture status. Additionally, we used a modified Priestley\u2010Taylor model for estimating LE of full vegetation. The proposed method was applied to TM/ETM+ imagery and was validated using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11266526006448837510", "cites_id": ["11266526006448837510"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JD026370", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hlMV07W9WpwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
