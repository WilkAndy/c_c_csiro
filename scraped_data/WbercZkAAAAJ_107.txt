Two homogenized data sources are used: (1) observed wind speed from nine land-based stations (1981\u20132014), including one mountain weather station (Iza\u00f1a) located above the trade-wind inversion layer; and (2) simulated wind speed from two atmospheric hindcasts over ocean (i.e., SeaWind I at 30 km for 1948\u20132014; and SeaWind II at 15 km for 1989\u20132014). The results revealed a widespread significant negative trend of trade-winds over ocean for 1948\u20132014, whereas no significant trends were detected for 1989\u20132014.
