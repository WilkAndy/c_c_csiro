Physically, evaporative demand is driven by four key variables \u2013 net radiation, vapour pressure, wind speed, and air temperature \u2013 each of which have been changing across the globe over the past few decades. In this research we examine five formulations of potential evaporation, testing for how well each captures the dynamics in evaporative demand. We generated daily potential evaporation datasets for Australia, spanning 1981\u20132006, using the: (i) Penman; (ii) Priestley\u2013Taylor; (iii) Morton point; (iv) Morton areal; and (v) Thornthwaite formulations. These represent a range in how many of the key driving variables are incorporated within modelling. The testing of these formulations was done by analysing the annual and seasonal trends in each against changes in precipitation (a proxy for actual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 478, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12979664370774096385", "cites_id": ["12979664370774096385"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410001460", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AbrI2_kHIbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 13, "2011": 27, "2012": 44, "2013": 30, "2014": 27, "2015": 39, "2016": 37, "2017": 45, "2018": 41, "2019": 39, "2020": 51, "2021": 41, "2022": 25, "2023": 6}}
