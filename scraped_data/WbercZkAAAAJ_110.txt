Given that in most spatial environmental research (eg, hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation prediction, and land-use monitoring, see Wilson and Gallant 2000) hydrologically correct DEMs are critical input, many researchers in developing countries are forced to generate their own DEMs to meet research needs.While a DEM can be considered any digital representation of the topographic landscape, it must also meet the criteria for which it will be used. While there are potentially many relatively new data sources from which to generate moderate resolution DEMs (ranging from ground survey with kinematic GPS to airborne photogrammetry, interferometry, and radar or laser altimetry, see Hutchinson and Gallant 2000), by far the most popular data source is digital topographic data used in an interpolation algorithm to generate a DEM. These data typically include contours, spot heights, rivers and lakes, and while this use of such topographic data appears straightforward, results can vary greatly as a function of both the quality of the input data and of the processing algorithm used. For example, while a DEM can be generated using a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) approach, the resultant DEM will often not be hydrologically correct. This can be seen by artificial features being present such as spurious triangular-shaped \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5852218527198388462", "cites_id": ["5852218527198388462"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/41197398/0fcfd50b847fe8dfa0000000.pdf20160115-19908-10stavh.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7qCefb5BN1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 9, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3}}
