It has similar spatial resolution to Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), with three additional spectral bands. We developed new algorithms for estimating both land surface broadband albedo and leaf area index (LAI) from ALI data. A recently developed atmospheric correction algorithm for ETM+ imagery was extended to retrieve surface spectral reflectance from ALI top-of-atmosphere observations. A feature common to these algorithms is the use of new multispectral information from ALI. The additional blue band of ALI is very useful in our atmospheric correction algorithm, and two additional ALI near-infrared bands are valuable for estimating both broadband albedo and LAI.
