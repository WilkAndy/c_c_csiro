The current DAFF/TERN-sponsored project \u2018Ground cover monitoring for Australia\u2019aims to operationalise the existing MODIS fractional cover product, perform field measurements to both validate and re-calibrate the existing algorithm, and make improvements to the algorithm to improve its accuracy. The primary objective of this report is to provide an assessment of the accuracy of the vegetation fractional cover estimates derived from the MODIS algorithm. This is achieved by: 1-Assessing the distribution of the pixels in the SR76/NDVI space using MODIS data across Australia 2-Testing the validity of the assumptions using field vegetation and spectral data acquired in NSW in 2010. 3-Comparing the estimates with field data obtained in a large number of sites in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8775257359631161161", "cites_id": ["8775257359631161161"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116314&sb=RECENT&n=12&rpp=25&page=113&tr=4064&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SZdyRRP6x3kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
