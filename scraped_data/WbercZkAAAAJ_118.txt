The current study was conducted to facilitate the operational use of remote sensing for field-level rice monitoring in Australia by determining (i) whether existing methods relating to simple moisture-based rice classification could be further simplified, and (ii) whether the high accuracies resulting from that moisture-based methodology could be further increased. First, the impact of removing the most complicated processing step, atmospheric correction, on rice classification accuracies was assessed for the 2000\u201301 summer growing season at the Coleambally Irrigation Area, New South Wales. The primary error sources of rice classification were then identified and simple rules developed in an attempt to reduce errors associated with confusion between unharvested winter cereals and flooded rice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1183752018160600503", "cites_id": ["1183752018160600503"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/EA02182", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t0WdUDCIbRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
