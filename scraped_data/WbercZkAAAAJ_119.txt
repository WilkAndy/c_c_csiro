To monitor and model this impact, monthly hydrometeorological databases were collated at 58 stations for 21 years (January 1980 to December 2000; a total of 252 months) in, and around, the Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) of the Loess Plateau, China. This report describes the spatial interpolation, using ANUSPLIN, of monthly surfaces (for the entire 21-year time series, not just average monthly conditions) of maximum and minimum air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, vapor pressure and sunshine hours. Vapor pressure was calculated at the stations from measurement of relative humidity and the monthly air temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12254946730361364756", "cites_id": ["12254946730361364756"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:ab8a151f-1119-4a56-ac60-70d1aaaa3216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FCGGLB9REqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
