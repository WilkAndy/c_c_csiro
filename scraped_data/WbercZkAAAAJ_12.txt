Understanding of the effects of vegetation on long-term catchment flows is growing, yet incorporation of these effects into hydrological models has typically been empirical and qualitative, or deterministic and quantitative \u2013 but at the cost of simplicity. Here we present a new ecohydrological model (the Budyko\u2013Choudhury\u2013Porporato, or BCP, model) that is the combination of two pre-existing models. It is simple, quantitative and process-based. As well as accounting for the well established roles played by average precipitation (P) and potential evaporation (Ep) on long-term catchment flows (R), the BCP model also provides estimates of n \u2013 a catchment-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 394, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7361509929980924367", "cites_id": ["7361509929980924367"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412001461", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zxEGQ0dWKWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 16, "2015": 23, "2016": 24, "2017": 32, "2018": 30, "2019": 34, "2020": 53, "2021": 57, "2022": 82, "2023": 28}}
