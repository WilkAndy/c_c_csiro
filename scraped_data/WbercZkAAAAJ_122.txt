BackgroundA key component of the Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA) is developing fundamental gridded water data products for actual evapotranspiration across Australia. To date. To date there has been no opportunity to assess the suitability of various actual evapotranspiration products. By critically a variety of existing AET products, project 2.2 aims to develop the evapotranspiration data products required by the Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) to achieve better hydrologic monitoring and modelling, and assist in their delivery of improved water management and reporting."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1878006493687854501", "cites_id": ["1878006493687854501"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wgm-Bastiaanssen/publication/237733716_Actual_Evapotranspiration_Datasets_for_Inter-Comparison_and_Evaluation/links/5978e645a6fdcc30bdc3283b/Actual-Evapotranspiration-Datasets-for-Inter-Comparison-and-Evaluation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pTUktvQEEBoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
