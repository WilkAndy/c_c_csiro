Hyperion can provide effective measures of agricultural performance through the use of spectral indices if systematic and random noise is managed and such noise management methods have been established for Coleambally. Among the sources of noise specific to Hyperion is the spectral \u201csmile\u201d which affects the location of the red-edge -- an important index in agricultural assessment. We show how this phenomenon, which arises from the pushbroom technology of Hyperion, affects the data and discuss how its effects can be overcome to provide stable and accurate measures of the red-edge and related indices. HyMap airborne data are used to evaluate the results of the methods studied. This paper also shows how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=225367257294469393,17261311332011941531", "cites_id": ["225367257294469393", "17261311332011941531"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/4898/0000/Improving-the-analysis-of-Hyperion-red-edge-index-from-an/10.1117/12.472696.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EXkKk1OqIAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
