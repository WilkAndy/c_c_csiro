Satellite remote sensing has the capacity to monitor both plant available moisture and land cover type and condition at regional scales over extended periods. It provides an excellent strategic monitoring tool to assess the level of drought stress and to indicate the need to respond at a regional scale.In recognition of this background, a cooperative international project combining satellite remote sensing measurements with regional water balance modelling has been carried out in China and Australia between 1991 and 1997 under the framework of the Australia-China Joint Science and Technology Commission. It has been implemented by CSIRO Land and Water and the CSIRO Earth Observation Centre in Australia and the Institute of Remote Sensing Application of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The objective of the work has been to investigate and demonstrate the potential for an operational system based on satellite and other geographic data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7542632152898379364", "cites_id": ["7542632152898379364"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fuqin-Li/publication/228910406_Soil_Moisture_and_Drought_Monitoring_Using_Remote_Sensing_Theoretical_Background_and_Methods/links/09e4150f77f00c2732000000/Soil-Moisture-and-Drought-Monitoring-Using-Remote-Sensing-Theoretical-Background-and-Methods.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZJ7yAPvPrGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
