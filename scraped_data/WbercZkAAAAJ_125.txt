We also compare the simulations of these models under doubled CO 2 and a range of climate scenarios. For contemporary conditions, the biogeography models successfully simulate the geographic distribution of major vegetation types and have similar estimates of area for forests (42 to 46% of the conterminous United States), grasslands (17 to 27%), savannas (15 to 25%), and shrublands (14 to 18%). The biogeochemistry models estimate similar continental-scale net primary production (NPP; 3125 to 3772\u00d7 10 12 gC yr\u2212 1) and total carbon storage (108 to 118\u00d7 10 15 gC) for contemporary conditions. Among the scenarios of doubled CO 2 and associated equilibrium climates produced by the three general circulation models (Oregon State University (OSU), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO)), all three biogeography models show both gains and losses of total forest area depending on the scenario (between 38 and 53% of conterminous United States area). The only consistent gains in forest area with all three models (BIOME2, DOLY, and MAPSS) were under the GFDL scenario due to large increases in precipitation. MAPSS lost forest area under UKMO, DOLY under OSU, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8976854528694352335", "cites_id": ["8976854528694352335"], "pub_url": "https://scholarworks.umt.edu/ntsg_pubs/46/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z_ku56ExlHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 6, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
