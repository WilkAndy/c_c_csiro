They provide important environmental services for society and ecosystems, regulating water supply and quality, flood mitigation, and the biological diversity of aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates how the drivers of streamflow characteristics vary at the level of regional management (regional [104 km2] and continental scales [107 km2]) in eastern Australia. Three hydrological signatures were used to represent streamflow characteristics: runoff coefficient, baseflow index, and zero flow ratio. Long\u2010term streamflow data and 24 spatially distributed biophysical properties from 354 catchments in eastern Australia were analysed with random forest and generalized additive beta regression models to determine the dominant drivers of streamflow characteristics.
