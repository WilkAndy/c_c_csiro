The reliability and utility of the physically based Penman\u2013Monteith approach to generate ETpot has been recently advocated. Assuming land-surface conditions, spatial surfaces of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) can be generated taking into account the topographic influence of forcing meteorological variables. This was performed in this paper by spatially interpolating maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperatures, wind speed (u) and vapor pressure (ea), using a spline model with a linear sub-model dependency on elevation, and modelling the radiation environment, taking topography (i.e., elevation, slope and aspect) into account, prior to calculating ET0 at each grid-cell. In accordance with previous research, resultant lapse rates showed a strong seasonal pattern; values were steeper in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 394, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6999022934451550089", "cites_id": ["6999022934451550089"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216940700114X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iffLxkaGIWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 14, "2009": 21, "2010": 22, "2011": 34, "2012": 23, "2013": 29, "2014": 18, "2015": 28, "2016": 27, "2017": 34, "2018": 40, "2019": 19, "2020": 23, "2021": 25, "2022": 20, "2023": 13}}
