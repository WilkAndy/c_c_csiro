To understand their respective roles, a large number of partitioning studies were conducted. However, each of the scattered case studies may only provide local-to-regional understanding of the contributions from climate-induced changes and human-induced changes to streamflow variations over various study periods. To address if it is possible to reveal the relative contribution of climate-induced changes (dQ_CIC) and human-induced changes (dQ_HIC) from the spatially distributed case studies, and then to predict regional to global spatial pattern of streamflow changes due to climate-induced changes, we reviewed 103 studies providing access to 1321 catchment cases, and performed a meta-analysis which characterized how that population varied with the number of catchment cases per study and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9631678876842112939", "cites_id": ["9631678876842112939"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420308477", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q7fOXOiYqoUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
