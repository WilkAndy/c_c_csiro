However, available methods: to estimate these two parameters, especially LAD, are limited. In this study, we propose a field measurement method using multi-angular digital images to estimate LAI and LAD simultaneously from the area proportions of: (i) sunlit soil; (ii) sunlit leaves; (iii) shaded soil; and (iv) shaded leaves. A new expression of the fraction of sunlit leaves is developed based on the radiative transfer theory. Coupling the measured and modeled fractions with an optimization scheme, LAI and the LAD parameters are derived from inverting a fractional model of sunlit and shaded leaves and soil. Through four tests using simulated scenes and in situ measurements for row crops, it is determined that our method performs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3746290886727715055", "cites_id": ["3746290886727715055"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192317302083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:70iweLZ__TMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
