Development was started in 2008, and the system currently runs operationally in BoM as well as in CSIRO. The primary focus is integrating observations from on-ground measurement networks and satellite remote sensing. Hydrological models are needed to do this: to integrate and reconcile the observations; to fill in gaps in space and time; and to estimate water balance terms not (well) observed. AWRA includes a grid-based landscape hydrological model (AWRA-L) and a river hydrological model (AWRA-R, based on the Source IMS software). Both have a groundwater representation, but for complex groundwater systems a new model component (AWRA-G) is being developed.
