Alongside the basic meteorological data of Jones et al.(2009) and the remotely sensed vegetation cover data of Donohue et al.(2008), these datasets constitute a valuable resource for characterizing and modelling of dynamics in ecological and hydroclimatological processes across Australian landscapes. The point of this note is to briefly describe these new datasets and draw attention to their availability. All data consist of daily 0.05 resolution grids, covering continental Australia, and spanning the period from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2006 (to be updated on a research-need basis). Using the aforementioned meteorological and vegetation cover data, as well as a specifically developed wind speed dataset"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5970024253731849318", "cites_id": ["5970024253731849318"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43489061/A_data_resource_for_analysing_dynamics_i20160307-28235-1cs33g.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZkQnoG3J2VIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
