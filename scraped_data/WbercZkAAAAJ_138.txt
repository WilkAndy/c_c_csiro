Our radiometric calibration method uses the Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) algorithm to statistically select invariant features over land areas from multiple image-pairs that are compared to assess changes in the instrument's calibration. This method requires no a priori regional knowledge and is globally applicable. A calibrated time series from Pseudo-Invariant Features located in central Australia are shown to have long-term trends removed. The resulting MAD-based calibration has a root mean squared error of \u223c5\u20136% for both channels 1 and 2 and is in alignment with other approaches."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11261850900093163655", "cites_id": ["11261850900093163655"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425707003422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h1h3zbkhSpwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
