How have vegetation dynamics responded to these changes and what are the implications for hydrology? To answer these questions, we examine the impacts of changes in mean air temperature (T mean), precipitation (P) and winter snow cover extent (SCE) in the headwaters of the Yellow River basin (HYRB) on two important vegetation dynamic metrics:(i) the maximum growing-season greenness (represented by the monthly maximum NDVI); and (ii) the beginning of growing season (BGS). Satellite-derived NDVI and SCE, along with observation-based gridded climate data, show that during the past 34 years (1982\u20132015) the HYRB experienced widespread vegetation greening, while no significant trend in BGS was observed. Spring greenness and phenology were significantly affected by SCE change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15584737608036539399", "cites_id": ["15584737608036539399"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9466/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B1ywdEgcSNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
