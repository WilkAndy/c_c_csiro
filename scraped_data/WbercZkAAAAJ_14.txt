Several AVHRR-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets exist, each based on the AVHRR Global Area Coverage archive but differing in their processing to correct for sensor and atmospheric effects. This paper presents a global comparative analysis for the land surface involving four AVHRR-derived NDVI data sets: (1) Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL); (2) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS); (3) Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 (V3); and (4) Fourier-Adjustment, Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated Reconstructed (FASIR). Our aims are two-fold: (1) to assess the level of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 359, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11822811658621764972", "cites_id": ["11822811658621764972"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425711001957", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bEV_RpAQE6QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 17, "2013": 32, "2014": 34, "2015": 46, "2016": 37, "2017": 23, "2018": 24, "2019": 36, "2020": 32, "2021": 31, "2022": 28, "2023": 11}}
