In this paper, we developed a semi-empirical model (Crop-SI) to estimate the yield of the three major crops in the dryland Australian wheatbelt by combining a radiation use efficiency approach with meteorology driven Stress Indices (SI) at critical crop growth stages (e.g., anthesis and grain filling). These crop-specific SI (e.g., drought, heat and cold stress) help explain the impact of high spatial agro-environmental heterogeneity, which lead to substantial improvement in grain yield prediction. Crop-SI explains 87%, 69% and 83% of the observed field-scale grain yield variability with root mean square error of ~0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 t/ha for canola, wheat, and barley, respectively. At the pixel-level, Crop-SI reduces the relative error in grain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3045235928146427203", "cites_id": ["3045235928146427203"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192319304885", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q71sOvHZQioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 9}}
