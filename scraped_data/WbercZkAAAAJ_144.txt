This study investigates changes in near\u2010surface wind speed over northern China from 1961 to 2016, and analyzes the associated physical mechanisms using station observations, reanalysis products and model simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5). The homogenized near\u2010surface wind speed shows a significantly (p < 0.05) decline trend of \u22120.103 m s\u22121 decade\u22121, which stabilized from the 1990s onwards. Similar negative trends are observed for all seasons, with the strongest trends occurring in the central and eastern parts of northern China. Fast warming has occurred at high\u2010latitudes (i.e., >50\u00b0N) in recent decades, which has weakened the annual and seasonal meridional air temperature gradient (\u22120.33\u00b0C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9208458777539161093", "cites_id": ["9208458777539161093"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JD033637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BawMPHgEy38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
