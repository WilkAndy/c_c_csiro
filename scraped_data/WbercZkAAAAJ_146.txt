This revolution led to increases in yield potential of 2 to 3 times that of traditional varieties (Khush, 1987). Similar trends have also been seen in the Irrigation Areas and Districts of southern New South Wales (NSW) as the local breeding program has produced many improved varieties of rice adapted to local growing conditions since the 1960\u2019s (Brennan et al., 1994). Increases in area of rice planted, rice quality, and paddy yield resulted (Brennan et al., 1994). Increased rice area, however, has led to the development of high water tables and risk of large tracts of land becoming salt-affected in southern NSW (Humphreys et al., 1994b). These concerns have led to various environmental regulations on rice in the region, culminating in 1994 when restrictions on rice area, soil suitability, and water consumption were fully enacted (Humphreys et al., 1994b). Strict environmental restrictions in combination with large areas of land make the management of this region a difficult task. Land managers require, among other things, a way of regulating water use, assessing or predicting crop area and productivity, and making management decisions in support of environmentally and economically sustainable agriculture. In the search for more time and cost effective methods for attaining these goals, while monitoring complex management situations, many have turned to remote sensing and Geographic Information System \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15410137767654457370", "cites_id": ["15410137767654457370"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/175", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GgDgPKfO29UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
