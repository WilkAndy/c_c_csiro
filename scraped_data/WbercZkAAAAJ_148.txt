These models were made by the CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship for the Murray Darling Basin Authority.The River Murray Floodplain Inundation Model (RiM-FIM) method links measurements of water height at flow gauges to the extent of inundation mapped from Landsat satellite images and interpolates the distribution of inundation across the landscape using a lidar digital elevation model (DEM). RIM-FIM enables the distribution of inundation to be predicted at 5m spatial resolution over large areas, and at flow levels that were not observed in the Landsat images. The RIM-FIM models in this project show flood extents at 1GL increments in total daily flow ranging from the smallest flood shown in the images to the largest recorded flow with a measured height."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16235094710723941519", "cites_id": ["16235094710723941519"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16235094710723941519&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jxSGR5-kTuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
