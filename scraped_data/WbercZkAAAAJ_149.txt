To better capture effective domain dynamics, a suite of algorithms have recently been developed that blend high spatial resolution/low temporal density imagery (eg, Landsat TM/ETM+) with low spatial resolution/high temporal density imagery (eg, MODIS). The output is a series of simulated surface reflectance imagery with high spatial resolution and high temporal density. As yet, there has been no definitive comparison of advanced algorithms (ie, STARFM and ESTARFM) to each other over sites with vastly different domain characteristics, or when compared to computationally efficient simple algorithms used as a performance benchmark. Using a series of Landsat-MODIS pairs, we evaluated STARFM and ESTARFM against two simple algorithms to characterise their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8274634574271892378", "cites_id": ["8274634574271892378"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP128838&sb=RECENT&n=25&rpp=25&page=45&tr=4079&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mkuk7U1o1XIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
