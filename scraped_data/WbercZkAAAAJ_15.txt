Trends in vegetation cover are interpreted within Budyko's energy \u2013 water limitation framework. Results from an Australia\u2010wide analysis indicate that vegetation cover (as described by the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation; fPAR) has increased, on average, by 0.0007 per year \u2013 an increase of \u223c8% over the 26 years. The majority of this change is due to a 0.0010 per year increase in persistent fPAR (representing nondeciduous perennial vegetation types; up 21%). In contrast, recurrent fPAR (representing deciduous, annual and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 359, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3479728944335951207", "cites_id": ["3479728944335951207"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01746.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZxXK2Ql7SjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 10, "2010": 18, "2011": 27, "2012": 27, "2013": 33, "2014": 24, "2015": 24, "2016": 31, "2017": 27, "2018": 23, "2019": 31, "2020": 19, "2021": 26, "2022": 19, "2023": 10}}
