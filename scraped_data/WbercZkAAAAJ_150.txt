Physically, evaporative demand is driven by four key variables\u2014net radiation, vapour pressure, wind speed, and air temperature\u2014each of which have been changing across the globe over the past few decades. Analyses of long-term changes in potential evaporation require a fully dynamic formulation where the effects of changes in each of the driving variables are accounted for. Often, however, adequate input data describing all four variables are unavailable.In this research we sought to produce a potential evaporation data set suitable for the analysis of long-term dynamics in evaporative demand. Prior to the calculation of potential evaporation, we tested the temporal accuracy of the surface-based input data, by comparing trends derived from the input surfaces with equivalent trends from the underlying observation data. Another test of the input data compared trends in modelled US Class A pan evaporation, generated using the input surfaces, with observed trends in pan evaporation. Results indicated that the input data were suitable for looking at long-term temporal dynamics in evaporative demand."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16268708879118686882", "cites_id": ["16268708879118686882"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43489055/wfhc-evaporative-demand-dynamics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:otocvocQxuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
