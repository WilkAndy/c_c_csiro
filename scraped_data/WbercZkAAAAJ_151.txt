Better forecasting skill by catchment models will enable better management decisions by river managers and planners. A key element in this project is to improve catchment-scale hydrologic models through utilisation of multiple types of high frequency spatial data including:(1) reflective, thermal and microwave remote sensing;(2) ground-based radar-rainfall;(3) gauge measurements of stream flow;(4) distributed observations of soil moisture; and (5) 0\u20137 day forecasts from Numerical Weather Prediction models. Outputs from this work will deliver into two eWater CRC Product Development Programs, being:(1) River OPerationS (RiverOPS); and (2) the Water and Constituent Accounting Simulation Tool (WaterCAST).There are multiple benefits for developing an improved capability for stream flow forecasting. These include improved efficiencies of water use through better anticipation of river inflows (particularly associated with flows from unregulated tributaries); a concomitant reduction in water losses and shortfalls on irrigation orders; better targeting of environmental flows by augmenting releases with natural flow events; basin wide consistency in management operations based on a thorough knowledge of variation in inflows and off-takes in time and space; an enhanced capability for predicting and monitoring flood events; and a better understanding of past catchment water dynamics through reanalysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5331971898573789344", "cites_id": ["5331971898573789344"], "pub_url": "https://users.monash.edu.au/~jpwalker/reports/eWater08.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oBjbFjH4_kkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
