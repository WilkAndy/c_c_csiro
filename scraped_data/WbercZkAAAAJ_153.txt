The project aims to (1) establish and validate measures of WUE arrived at by water balance modelling, applying the WAVES (water, atmosphere, vegetation, energy, solute) model;(2) establish and validate measures of land degradation by understanding soil processes through detailed analysis of toposequences;(3) derive regional assessments of both water and soil processes (and their interrelationships) by using spatial information systems and remote sensing; and (4) convey the findings to local farmers and local, regional and national policy makers by developing practical management manuals for farmers and technology transfer methods based on indicators for policy makers. The volume is divided into four sections: water balance modelling, soil-environment impacts, spatial information systems and technology transfer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15494642287384027191", "cites_id": ["15494642287384027191"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023098253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N2BF9RAHCNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2}}
