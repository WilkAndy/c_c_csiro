The product includes 10 meteorological variables: precipitation, air temperature, daily minimum and maximum air temperature, surface pressure, relative and specific humidity, wind speed, and downward shortwave and longwave radiation. The historical part of the record starts 1 January 1979 and is based on ERA5 data bias corrected and downscaled using high-resolution reference climatologies. The data extension to within \u223c3 h of real time is based on analysis data from GDAS. The 30-member medium-range forecast ensemble is based on GEFS and updated daily. Finally, the 51-member long-range forecast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13428856194957389750", "cites_id": ["13428856194957389750"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/3/BAMS-D-21-0145.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ti89aI_hXLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
