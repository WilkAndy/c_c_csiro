Herein we calibrated and applied the CMRSET (CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling EvapoTranspiration) model at the continental scale in Australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m (MODIS, VIIRS), 30 m (Landsat) to 20 m (Sentinel-2), and temporal frequencies ranging from daily (MODIS, VIIRS) to multi-days (Landsat and Sentinel-2). The five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor (kc) based on two vegetation indices which modify Priestley-Taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates (ETp; calculated from nation-wide daily meteorological grids) to obtain ETa. CMRSET was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across Australia, representing a wide variety of land covers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15009672129776434778", "cites_id": ["15009672129776434778"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421013688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wr5nAkcRTdAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 7}}
