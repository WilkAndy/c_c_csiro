However, the existing scientific studies focused on observed wind gusts are relatively few compared to those on mean wind speed. In Australia, previous studies found a slowdown of near-surface mean wind speed, termed \u201cstilling,\u201d but a lack of knowledge on the multidecadal variability and trends in the magnitude (wind speed maxima) and frequency (exceeding the 90th percentile) of wind gusts exists. A new homogenized daily peak wind gusts (DPWG) dataset containing 548 time series across Australia for 1941\u20132016 is analyzed to determine long-term trends in wind gusts. Here we show that both the magnitude and frequency of DPWG declined across \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18081245716074348594", "cites_id": ["18081245716074348594"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/8/JCLI-D-20-0590.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MkAqIy597foJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
