However, these data are often contaminated by different kinds of optical noise (e.g. cloud, cloud shadow, snow, aerosol), making accurate phenology extraction challenging. We present an open\u2010source state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art R package called phenofit$$ phenofit $$ to extract vegetation phenological information from satellite\u2010derived VIs. phenofit$$ phenofit $$ adopts state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art phenology extraction methods, such as a weight updating function for reducing optical noise contamination, a growing season division function for separating the VI time series into different vegetation cycles, and rough and fine fitting functions for reconstructing VI time series. They work together to make phenology extraction from frequently contaminated VIs easier and more accurate.
