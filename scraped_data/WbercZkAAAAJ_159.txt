Results for three virtual dual-view sensors constructed from Himawari-8/AHI (one of the next generation of geostationary sensors) paired with MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS are reported. Over 1270 representative Hyperion passes were used to reproduce, by spectral band integration, \u201csimultaneous\u201d observations by the three pairs of sensors, and linear relationships between AHI-MODIS and AHI-VIIRS were established, allowing the conversion of MODIS bands and VIIRS bands to AHI bands. For 95% of the sample pixels, a maximum reflectance conversion error\u202f<\u202f0.004 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13906700144205373124", "cites_id": ["13906700144205373124"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718300750", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xB48rRmG_sAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
