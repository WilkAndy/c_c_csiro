To assess how remotely sensed data can be used, a review of current international uses of remotely sensed data was made and several topics requiring further research by remote sensing specialists identified. Consequently, the review focuses on current techniques used by Australian agencies, and also assesses current international methods, as well as proposing some possible new research directions that may use remote sensing for drought assessment and management. The primary scientific information that remote sensing can provide is the estimation of vegetation cover and condition, soil moisture, and the spatial limits to drought exceptional circumstances."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 351, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13032655668279257487", "cites_id": ["13032655668279257487"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X98000262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jynEw0dL3bQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 8, "2001": 6, "2002": 7, "2003": 1, "2004": 10, "2005": 12, "2006": 9, "2007": 15, "2008": 24, "2009": 16, "2010": 14, "2011": 17, "2012": 24, "2013": 19, "2014": 20, "2015": 15, "2016": 23, "2017": 28, "2018": 14, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 12}}
