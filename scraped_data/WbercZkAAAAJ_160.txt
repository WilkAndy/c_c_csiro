Stationarity is the concept that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability (Milly et al., 2008), and is a fundamental principle of much water resource management. In an ecohydrological context, stationarity assumes that the envelope of variability of vegetation water use will be constant in the face of changing:(i) forcing meteorological data (eg, precipitation, net radiation, vapor pressure, wind speed and air temperature);(ii) atmospheric composition (eg, CO2 changes);(iii) fire frequency and intensity; and (iv) other factors (eg, management of forests). As vegetation can physiologically adapt this stationary vegetation response is increasingly being questioned within Australia\u2019s water resource management agencies. With the unprecedented low streamflow observed in the current \u2018Big Dry\u2019drought, when vegetation in many forested catchments in south-east Australia was actively recovering from widespread bushfires earlier in the decade (eg, Lane et al., 2010, Mannik et al., 2009), many managers are acknowledging that streamflow from the high rainfall catchments is changing in a non-stationary manner. Non-stationarity acknowledges that there are longerterm changes, with the \u2018envelope of variability\u2019governing ecohydrological responses itself changing.There are two distinct classes of non-stationarity that influence the volume of streamflow yielded from the high rainfall catchments, they are:(i) hydro-climatic non-stationarity; and (ii) vegetation-functioning non-stationarity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1417104776547265225", "cites_id": ["1417104776547265225"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/81203032/wfhc-climatic-changes-high-rainfall-mdb.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yeqbP0mRqhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
