We emphasise ways that the long-term (20-year) Australia-wide database of satellite images can be used to extract information and to enhance the knowledge used to forecast the behaviour of Australia\u2019s biophysical landscape. We focus on data that covers the entire Australian landmass, on at least a daily basis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11645665548594863078", "cites_id": ["11645665548594863078"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/44241528/A_review_of_predictive_modelling_from_a_20160330-9873-n0i0n9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5lsAdR23naEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
