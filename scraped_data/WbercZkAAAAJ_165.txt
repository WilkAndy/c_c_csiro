This debate, in part, can be avoided by evaluating the spatial accuracy of geospatial data, leading to heightened confidence in both the data and the decisions made from the data. To increase the effectiveness of environmental compliance monitoring, the spatial accuracies of 2 Geographic Information System datasets were estimated at the Coleambally Irrigation Area, New South Wales. The first, high-resolution digital aerial photography acquired in January 2000, is the Geographic Information System baseline data for Coleambally Irrigation Area. The second, Digital Topographic Data Base roads data, although not a reference dataset at Coleambally Irrigation Area, is often used as a baseline dataset across Australia.
