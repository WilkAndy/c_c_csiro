Vegetation, flow regime and sediment retention are critical components for the formation, evolution and stability of these rivers; however, the connections relating river dynamics with riparian vegetation development and distribution are still not well known. This review discusses the relationship between anabranching rivers and riparian vegetation, showing examples of how vegetation affects anabranching rivers and how it is also affected by river dynamics. Consequences of poor management and human activities that can disrupt river\u2013vegetation systems are also explored, presenting some examples of modifications to the stability and longevity of anabranching rivers. Challenges to design and implement appropriate policy and management practices in anabranching rivers are most frequently driven by poor experimental evidence due to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17677330292384472750", "cites_id": ["17677330292384472750"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ECO.2370", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rh7UDj5-UvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 8}}
