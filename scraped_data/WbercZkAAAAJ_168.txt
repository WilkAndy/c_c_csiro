NDTI is derived by linking meteorological point data and optical (both thermal and reflective) remotely sensed data in a way that optimally utilises process understanding of ma and the inherent strengths of these different data types. NDTI is generated using a \u2018calculate-theninterpolate\u2019approach to best use the strengths of the two primary datasets-meteorological data are temporally dense (and spatially sparse), whereas remotely sensed data are spatially dense (and temporally sparse). The spatial interpolation is performed using covariates that are heavily governed by the spatially dense remotely sensed data, which allow for better modelling of ma in-between meteorological stations (eg, over water bodies, which would otherwise not be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17797538064637497842", "cites_id": ["17797538064637497842"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d1cbb7ec21f5464ad5cac02323f866c81975960d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8hE2C5OO_fYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
