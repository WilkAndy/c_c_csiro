Managers at these five levels of government need access to information to assist them to plan the land use change prior to making on-the-ground decisions. To this end, the suitability of 38 predominately native species in the 113,000 km2 Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) study site has been mapped at a 100 m resolution. This was achieved by using a quint-variate spatial overlay approach as we were able to readily access the required environmental variables and rules defining the species\u2019 requirements (or tolerances). As the rules did not consider optimal growth they were possibly \u2018too inclusive\u2019, so the spatial extent of areas suggested for re-planting were refined by defining \u2018target areas\u2019 for trees \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13224884487253874022", "cites_id": ["13224884487253874022"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a6f3ba928cfd06e94160fc69230b4c154405323f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZlVXal86iLcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
