This data, in conjunction with other remotely sensed and ancillary datasets collected over the site, is being used to develop a range of applications in precision agriculture. This paper evaluates the potential of Hyperion hyperspectral data for providing improved yield prediction. A number of hyperspectral indices were derived from a processed Hyperion images and compared with the rice yield data over several paddocks. Results show that new hyperspectral indices such as the first derivative value and wavelength position of the red edge inflection point are more sensitive to within-paddock variations in yield than commonly used indices such as NDVI. It was also shown that the relationship between indices and yield varied among the paddocks.
