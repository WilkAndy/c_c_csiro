Accurate geometric correction, to known standards, of satellite images is crucial for many remote sensing applications, especially those using a time series of images and integrating other spatially referenced datasets. It is critical that data acquired by satellites with short repeat intervals (e.g., daily) are geolocated using methods that are both automatic and reliable. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) high-resolution imagery was used to establish ground control point (GCP) networks for two coastal regions of Australia, one tropical with 40 GCPs and one temperate with 60 GCPs. The geolocation accuracy was assessed for a total of 12 and 13 AVHRR images, respectively, against the GCPs for each region, respectively, totalling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11474550677289200737", "cites_id": ["11474550677289200737"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5589/m08-064", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YWwK1QvLPZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
