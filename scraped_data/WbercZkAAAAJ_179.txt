Herein a time series based radiative transfer model was developed to simultaneously retrieve properties of clouds, aerosols and surface albedo, which were in turn used to calculate the components of SSI: i.e., global, direct and diffuse irradiance. The calculated results were calibrated across the Australian continent against in-situ measurements to account for minor factors (e.g., water vapor) not considered by the physics-based method. Detailed validation of the SSI components was performed against three years of in-situ measurements at 11 sites across Australia, at a range of time scales (i.e., instantaneous, hourly, daily and monthly) and under both all-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The main advantage of the present method is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16762480374500326205", "cites_id": ["16762480374500326205"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X21002176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PXuM1BZLoOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
