However, despite water and carbon cycle coupling, there are few diagnostic global evapotranspiration models that have complete carbon constraint on water flux run at a high spatial resolution. Here we estimate 8-day global ET and gross primary production (GPP) at 500\u202fm resolution from July 2002 to December 2017 using a coupled diagnostic biophysical model (called PML-V2) that, built using Google Earth Engine, takes MODIS data (leaf area index, albedo, and emissivity) together with GLDAS meteorological forcing data as model inputs. PML-V2 is well calibrated against 8-day measurements at 95 widely-distributed flux towers for 10 plant functional types, indicated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias being 0.69\u202fmm\u202fd\u22121 and \u22121.8% for ET respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 323, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15231515110473353594", "cites_id": ["15231515110473353594"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442571830590X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eknC_ko2YdMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 10, "2020": 27, "2021": 88, "2022": 133, "2023": 63}}
