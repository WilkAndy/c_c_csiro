EP13058 Australia", "abstract": "High frequency, spatially explicit ground cover information is required to improve wind and water erosion modelling and monitoring, and our understanding of the impact of climate variability and changing management practice on pasture condition, particularly in the rangelands. Ultimately, a national network of sensor independent reference sites is required to improve validation of land cover products derived from remotely sensed data and which are monitored using agreed standardised sampling approaches.To meet these needs the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has funded delivery of a validated remotely sensed time-series of fractional cover for Australia using MODIS satellite data based on the method of Guerschman et al.(2009). The fractional cover product will provide monthly ground cover data to better parameterise the CEMSYS (Shao et al. 2007) wind erosion model and the SedNet (Wilkinson et al. 2004) water erosion model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7777124385836896343", "cites_id": ["7777124385836896343"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP13058&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VxDWh2zl7WsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
