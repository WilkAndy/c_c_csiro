The climatologies were produced using neural networks trained with daily P observations from 93,138 gauges and hourly P observations (resampled to 3-hourly) from 11,881 gauges worldwide. Mean validation coefficient of determination (R2) values ranged from 0.76 to 0.80 for the daily P occurrence indices, and from 0.44 to 0.84 for the daily peak P intensity indices. The neural networks performed significantly better than current state-of-the-art reanalysis (ERA5) and satellite (IMERG) products for all P indices. Using a 0.1\u2009mm 3\u2009h\u22121 threshold, P was estimated to occur 12.2%, 7.4%, and 14.3% of the time, on average, over the global, land, and ocean domains \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6072639098577472306", "cites_id": ["6072639098577472306"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00631-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Msvb_xVZRlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
