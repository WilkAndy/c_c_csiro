However, the underlying causes of maximum wind speed variability in urbanized regions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated how rapid urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, impacted daily maximum wind speed (DMWS) between 1990 and 2015, based on near-surface (10 m height) DMWS observations, reanalysis datasets, and night-time lighting data (a proxy for urbanization). The station observation shows that annual DMWS in the YRD significantly (p < 0.05) declined during 1990\u20132015, by \u22120.209 m s\u22121 decade\u22121, while slightly (p > 0.1) positive trends were found in NCEP-NCAR1 (+0.048 m s\u22121 decade\u22121) and ERA5 (+0.027 m s\u22121 decade\u22121). An increasing divergence between the reanalysis output and the station observation since 2005 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4338175981751296419", "cites_id": ["4338175981751296419"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095522000657", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o-FqHRJMNDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
