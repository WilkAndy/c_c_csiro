On basis of geomorphological theory, targeting to read all the information from topographic map data, including contours, spot heights and stream-line, and to describe the terrain features efficiently, the breakpoint from steep to flatten in the diagram of the RMS slope and resolutions could be regarded as an optimal resolution. The method was introduced and demonstrated with DEM interpolating based on 1\u2236 250,000 and 1\u2236 10,000 topographic datasets with contour intervals of 100 m and 5 m respectively in loess plateau. The results show that the resolutions for the two scales of topographic maps are 50 m and\ue008 2.5 m\ue009."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9620997872627164726", "cites_id": ["9620997872627164726"], "pub_url": "http://ckyyb.crsri.cn/EN/abstract/abstract1056.shtml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nia7RpemhIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
