We hypothesize that the sub-diurnal AET-VPD hysteresis results from the interplay between evaporative demand and soil moisture supply limitations. To test our hypothesis, we quantify the sub-diurnal AET-VPD hysteresis across a broad range of biomes and climates based on the observations from the 89 FLUXNET sites (703 site-years) across the globe. We find that the magnitude of hysteresis varies with biomes and climates and is mostly attributable to evaporative demand limitation in all ten sampled biomes.
