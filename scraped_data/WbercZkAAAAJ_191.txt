LIRAs are important to Australia\u2019s water balance, as they transfer and store a disproportionately large amount of water relative to their area. Examples of LIRAs are irrigated areas, loodplains, off\u2011reach wetlands, off\u2011reach storages and groundwater\u2011dependent ecosystems. Often these areas do not have enough ground\u2011based metering to determine their water use with enough confidence to support national water accounts. For much of Australia\u2019s rural landscape AET is limited by water availability, with precipitation (P) being the only source of water. However, due to inlows above or below\u2011ground, whether natural or anthropogenic, there are areas where AET exceeds P (ie the LIRAs). Using gridded P data, we can determine how much of the LIRA\u2011AET can be attributed to lateral inlow. Having access to this information assists in reconciling national water accounts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7669004666937092706", "cites_id": ["7669004666937092706"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43489081/Estimating_Actual_Evapotranspiration_of_20160307-29926-olvz6u.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YiqZyRzHbWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
