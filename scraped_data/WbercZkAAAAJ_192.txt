The transition from a warm El Ni\u00f1o phase at the beginning of the year to a cool La Ni\u00f1a phase by July contributed to many notable events, ranging from record wetness across much of Australia to historically low Eastern Pacific basin and near-record high North Atlantic basin hurricane activity. The remaining five main hurricane basins experienced below- to well-below-normal tropical cyclone activity. The negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation was a major driver of Northern Hemisphere temperature patterns during 2009/10 winter and again in late 2010. It contributed to record snowfall and unusually low temperatures over much of northern Eurasia and parts of the United States, while bringing above-normal temperatures to the high northern latitudes. The February Arctic Oscillation Index value was the most negative since records began in 1950. The 2010 average global land and ocean surface temperature was among the two warmest years on record. The Arctic continued to warm at about twice the rate of lower latitudes. The eastern and tropical Pacific Ocean cooled about 1\u00b0C from 2009 to 2010, reflecting the transition from the 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o to the 2010/11 La Ni\u00f1a. Ocean heat fluxes contributed to warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Global integrals of upper ocean heat content for the past several years have reached values consistently higher than for all prior times in the record, demonstrating the dominant role of the ocean in the Earth's energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8728767678510454989,912450297250536404", "cites_id": ["8728767678510454989", "912450297250536404"], "pub_url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9p31j9mb", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zdiG5PTPInkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
