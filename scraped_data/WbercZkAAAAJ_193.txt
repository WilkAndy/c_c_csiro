Some effort was made to assess the adequacy of the models for the project and to identify major sources of uncertainty, both in the scenarios assumed (external uncertainty) and in the river models used to estimate the resulting hydrological changes (internal uncertainty). The assessment addressed data availability, prior model review and testing, and new analysis. In particular, monthly river water balance terms simulated by the baseline river model (representing past climate and current development) were compared reach by reach with largely independent river water balance accounts.  Monthly river water balance accounts were developed for the period 1990-2006 wherever possible, by integrating direct streamflow measurements with diversion records, remote \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14854485305002916364", "cites_id": ["14854485305002916364"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.591516026585848", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DHr1ta67Jc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
