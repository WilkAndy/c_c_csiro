These data are used to support environmental management, and in most locations are the only historical spatial dataset. The Web-CATS (CSIRO AVHRR Time Series) system provides access to the Australasian Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data archive using the World Wide Web. The data archive consists of multiple daily satellite overpasses from several receiving stations in Australia since July 1981. The data are held online enabling the use of state-of-the-art algorithms to generate on-demand user-customized products. This novel design for operational and dynamic remote sensing data product generation enables Web-CATS users to browse the entire metadata-database and produce consistent time series information from on-line data in near real time. As these algorithms improve, users have the ability to easily re-process their dataset (s)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13061388636103023967", "cites_id": ["13061388636103023967"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Schmidt-20/publication/233727949_A_User-customized_Web-based_Delivery_System_of_Hypertemporal_Remote_Sensing_Datasets_for_Australasia/links/09e4150acf3833cf28000000/A-User-customized-Web-based-Delivery-System-of-Hypertemporal-Remote-Sensing-Datasets-for-Australasia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X50-KMNfQ7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
