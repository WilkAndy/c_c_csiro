This debate, in part, can be avoided by assessing the positional accuracy of geospatial data, leading to increased confidence (decreased uncertainty) in both the data and the decisions made from the data. In this study, we assessed the positional accuracy of two Geographic Information System (GIS) baseline datasets at the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA); high-resolution digital aerial photography acquired in January 2000, and the Digital Topographic Data Base (DTDB) roads data. We also assessed areal error of paddock measurements from an improved accuracy version of the high-resolution digital aerial photography. Positional accuracies were assessed by comparing well-defined features from both baseline datasets (original aerial photography and DTDB roads) to high-level accuracy Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) data for the same features. This assessment showed that neither baseline dataset met the National Mapping Council of Australia\u2019s standards of map accuracy. Consequently, we processed the original digital photography to create an improved dataset, which was over 2.5 times more accurate than the original photography, and over 4 times more accurate than the DTDB data. The improved dataset also met the map accuracy standard for Australia. We also assessed areal error by comparing paddock boundaries delineated from the improved dataset to those delineated from a DGPS associated with paddock \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10643905518289037893", "cites_id": ["10643905518289037893"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RSpw0Ky_tpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
