Assuming (near) full vegetation cover, it follows that this gross difference could be largely explained by either;(a) the leaves of woody plants reflecting less light, and/or (b) a larger amount of shaded surface in woody vegetation visible to satellite instruments.No general trend has emerged of differences in reflectance between tree and grass leaves (McCloy and Hall, 1991, Asner, 1998). Knapp and Carter (1998) found no consistent pattern in the reflectance and transmittance of beam near-infrared (NIR) light by leaves of 26 species with habitat; their leaves were from open, intermediate and shaded understory habitats.
