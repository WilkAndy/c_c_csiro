Particular attention is given to the validation of such approaches against ground based flux measurements. An assessment of some 30 published validations shows an average root mean squared error value of about 50 W m\u22122 and relative errors of 15\u201330%. The comparison also shows that more complex physical and analytical methods are not necessarily more accurate than empirical and statistical approaches. While some of the methods were developed for specific land covers (e.g. irrigation areas only) we also review methods developed for other disciplines, such as hydrology and meteorology, where continuous estimates in space and in time are needed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 1232, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=967050704260352869", "cites_id": ["967050704260352869"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-008-9037-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zcs6632naw0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 14, "2010": 41, "2011": 62, "2012": 88, "2013": 105, "2014": 89, "2015": 91, "2016": 101, "2017": 116, "2018": 124, "2019": 102, "2020": 95, "2021": 99, "2022": 71, "2023": 25}}
