Model inputs consist of Geographic Information System (GIS) maps of land use, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), soil texture, crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) which is retrieved from the 10-day maximum composite National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2013Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, and daily interpolated meteorological variables. The model is run at 92367 30\u2033\u00d730\u2033. resolution grids at an hourly time-step for energy balance and daily time-step for crop growth simulation. Simulated winter wheat and summer maize yields in 1992 and 1993 are compared with both the point samples and the county-level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 323, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18020043792713834905", "cites_id": ["18020043792713834905"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380004004855", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:meGw7VoOFPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 15, "2008": 15, "2009": 11, "2010": 21, "2011": 17, "2012": 16, "2013": 17, "2014": 35, "2015": 34, "2016": 15, "2017": 15, "2018": 26, "2019": 23, "2020": 21, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
