The lack of global near-real-time satellite-based products restricts the application of FVC in ecosystem modeling, climate change, and vegetation phenology studies. Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft provides daily spectral reflectance of the entire sunlit Earth in the near Hotspot directions. Hotspot observations (i.e., observation in Hotspot direction which has the peak backscattering reflected radiation) with only sunlit vegetation and sunlit soil components are more suitable for FVC estimation with a two-endmember mixture model as such observations exclude contributions from shaded vegetation and soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3770732538319560059", "cites_id": ["3770732538319560059"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425721005551", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e12L8UNVVDQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
