We demonstrate these effects using simulation modelling at two contrasting sites supporting Eucalyptus globulus Labill. or Pinus radiata D.Don plantations. The APSIM Eucalyptus and Pinus models simulated plantation growth within 2% of observed growth where the water table was at 4 m depth for eucalypts (height 28 m, MAI 32 m3 ha\u22121 year\u22121) and at 23 m for pines (height 37 m, MAI 20 m3 ha\u22121 year\u22121). In simulations without an aquifer, observed growth could only be matched using unrealistically high surface soil nitrogen (N) supply, suggesting this is an unlikely mechanism. Simulated aquifer N concentrations, evapotranspiration, and net N mineralization and leaching (emergent properties of modelling) were similar to measured values. These results strengthen the plausibility that aquifer N uptake by plantations could be contributing to tree growth. This hypothesis warrants further research that quantifies these processes at multiple sites. Simulations included growth of herbaceous and tree weed species, and pasture, which demonstrated the utility of the process-based APSIM modelling framework for dynamically simulating carbon, water and N of plantations and other mixed-species systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3307501507283457035", "cites_id": ["3307501507283457035"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1468478", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CxSz0xib5i0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
