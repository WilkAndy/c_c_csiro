Sample actual ET products were solicited from their developers with the specification that they should provide estimates for the whole of Australia at a minimum frequency of monthly, and at a spatial resolution of at least 5km. These time series were then evaluated against independent estimates of actual ET from flux measurement sites and multi-year catchment water balances. The products were also inter-compared to establish relative differences. It was found that for the large areas of Australia where ET is dependent mostly upon precipitation the estimates based on water balance modelling approaches performed best. In regions where lateral inflow contributes a significant fraction of the available water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3977446985400078009", "cites_id": ["3977446985400078009"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116845&sb=RECENT&n=3&rpp=10&page=213&tr=5147&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uU64tfW6MjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
