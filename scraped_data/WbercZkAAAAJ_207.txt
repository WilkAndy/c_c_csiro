Equations on energy balance, evapotranspiration, heat flow, and water balance, as factors in surface temperature, are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5480581458894845220", "cites_id": ["5480581458894845220"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19921967999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JPUErMzvDkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 2}}
