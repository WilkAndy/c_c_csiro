Monitoring the impact that humans have on these resources requires that these two sources of variability be partitioned, removing the natural variability to reveal variability due to management activities. Here, we present Compere, a relative benchmarking framework for monitoring the management\u2010driven impacts on ecosystem resources. The framework identifies locations in a region that share similar biophysical properties to a target location. Taking an attribute of interest, it then compares the value of the target location with those of all its biophysically equivalent locations, with any differences being attributed to variations in management. We provide an example application of Compere, using satellite\u2010derived vegetation cover data to examine the impact of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2766687564330085729", "cites_id": ["2766687564330085729"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.4006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ya1iZK4_ZSYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
