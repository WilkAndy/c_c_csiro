This paper develops the algorithm to estimate FVC at a 30-m/15-day resolution over China by taking advantage of the spatial and temporal information from different types of sensors: the 30-m resolution sensor on the Chinese environment satellite (HJ-1) and the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The algorithm was implemented for each main vegetation class and each land cover type over China. First, the high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was acquired using the continuous correction (CC) data assimilation method. Then, FVC was generated using a nonlinear pixel unmixing model. Model coefficients were obtained by statistical analysis of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:U_HPUtbDl20C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15822307147811513449", "cites_id": ["15822307147811513449"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15822307147811513449&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aeRtUIUglNsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
