For the first time, a scheme for regionalization of model parameters at the global scale was developed. We used data from a diverse set of 1787 small\u2010to\u2010medium sized catchments (  km2) and the simple conceptual HBV model to set up and test the scheme. Each catchment was calibrated against observed daily Q, after which 674 catchments with high calibration and validation scores, and thus presumably good\u2010quality observed Q and forcing data, were selected to serve as donor catchments. The calibrated parameter sets for the donors were subsequently transferred to 0.5\u00b0 grid cells with similar climatic and physiographic characteristics, resulting in parameter maps for HBV with global coverage. For each grid cell, we used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 296, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11584601525984341673", "cites_id": ["11584601525984341673"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015wr018247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qa6-xLXFxKAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 24, "2018": 26, "2019": 40, "2020": 56, "2021": 69, "2022": 50, "2023": 21}}
