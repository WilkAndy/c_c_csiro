However, this contradicts observations of greening and little systematic change in runoff over the past few decades and climate projections of future greening with slight increases in global runoff for the coming century. This calls into question the drought projections based on offline drought indices. To resolve this paradox, here we calculate a widely-used conventional 25 drought index (ie, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) using direct outputs from 16 CMIP5 models (PDSI_CMIP5) such that the hydrologic consistency between PDSI_CMIP5 and CMIP5 models is maintained. Results show that the global PDSI_CMIP5 remains generally unchanged as climate warms, demonstrating that CMIP5 models do not actually project a general increase in PDSI drought (more reflecting soil moisture/agricultural drought) under future warming. Further analyses indicate that 30 the projected increase in PDSI drought reported previously is primarily due to ignoring the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in the offline calculations. On one hand, elevated [CO2] directly reduces stomatal opening; on the other hand, elevated [CO2] increases air temperature and thus vapor pressure deficit, which also causes partial stomatal closure. Finally, we show that the overestimation of PDSI drought can be avoided by directly using the relevant climate 35 model outputs or by accounting for the effect of CO2 on evapotranspiration. Our findings refute the common \u201cwarming leads to drying\u201d perception and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11799680185173348370", "cites_id": ["11799680185173348370"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6d87/4465886145579b4b61110fe62564ac4d148c.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EhB5bJziwKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
