The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface for 2017 was 405.0 \u00b1 0.1 ppm, 2.2 ppm greater than for 2016 and the highest in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800 000 years. The global growth rate of CO2 has nearly quadrupled since the early 1960s. With ENSO-neutral conditions present in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during most of the year and weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions notable at the start and end, the global temperature across land and ocean surfaces ranked as the second or third highest, depending on the dataset, since records began in the mid-to-late 1800s. Notably, it was the warmest non-El Ni\u00f1o year in the instrumental record. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower tropospheric temperature was also either second or third highest according to all datasets analyzed. The lower stratospheric temperature was about 0.2\u00b0C higher than the record cold temperature of 2016 according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, and Bulgaria, reported record high annual temperatures. Mexico broke its annual record for the fourth consecutive year. On 27 January, the temperature reached 43.4\u00b0C at Puerto Madryn, Argentina-the highest temperature recorded so far south (43\u00b0S) anywhere in the world. On 28 May in Turbat, western Pakistan, the high of 53.5\u00b0C tied Pakistan's all-time highest temperature and became the world-record \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17120133251934317843", "cites_id": ["17120133251934317843"], "pub_url": "https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/377545", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E-3lfHzulu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
