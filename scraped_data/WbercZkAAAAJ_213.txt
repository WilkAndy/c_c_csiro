Process understanding is modelled linking meteorological data and optical remotely sensed data (both thermal and reflective) to derive the assessment of ma. The NDTI is calculated using a calculate-then-interpolate approach to best use the inherent strengths of two datasets-meteorological data, which are temporally dense (and spatially sparse), and remotely sensed data, which are spatially dense (and temporally sparse). The interpolation is performed using covariates that are heavily influenced by the spatially dense remotely sensed data. The CSIRO land and Water component of the Australian Water Availability Project will generate fortnightly NDTI sufaces from 1986 to 2005 for the Murray-Darling Basin; the spatial extent is defined by 23 to 39 south and 138 to 154 east, with the final resolution being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16363805259735128012", "cites_id": ["16363805259735128012"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:670c17c2-e872-49ae-8277-8fbbeb4abd71", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zFcuQC_qF-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
