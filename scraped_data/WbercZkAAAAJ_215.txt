A time series of Hyperion imagery has been acquired over the CIA during the 2000/2001 southern hemisphere summer growing season. Within the CIA, there are five different varieties of rice and several row crops grown, specifically corn, soy beans, and sorghum. Imagery has been acquired prior to rice canopy closure, pre-panicle initiation, at panicle initiation, during grain filling and after senescence. Extensive in situ ground sampling was also performed several times during the growing season to validate the spectral signatures received from Hyperion. We describe the databases developed that will be used in future instrument validation efforts.
