Several algorithms have been developed to estimate clear-sky NSR in mountains, but none have estimated NSR in mountainous terrain under all-sky (i.e., both clear and cloudy) conditions. Moreover, surface heterogeneity is considerable in mountains, and coarse-spatial-resolution satellites may not provide sufficient details for fine-scale applications. In this study, to address these challenges, we developed a method for fine-spatial-resolution (i.e., from 20 m to 30 m resolution) all-sky NSR estimation in mountains directly from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations with mountainous radiative transfer scheme (herein denoted \u2018TOPO\u2019). For comparison, we also created the model neglecting topography (herein called \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4093697284099571042", "cites_id": ["4093697284099571042"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722004709", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yn28lP27zzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
