These transmission losses support a range of ecosystems, but partitioning the volume of the transmission losses across the floodplain, riparian zone and in\u2010channel is difficult. This study presents a methodology relying primarily on multi\u2010decade satellite remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration estimates to partition these losses. The method was applied to the ~40,000\u2009km2 floodplain of Cooper Creek in the central Australian arid zone, where first, the alluvial landscape was classified based on actual evapotranspiration rates, and second, both regional\u2010 (i.e., for the entire floodplain) and local\u2010scale (i.e., for each waterhole) water balances were calculated to partition these losses. Regional\u2010scale results estimated that 82% of transmission losses occurred on the floodplain, 13 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17948219531632876294", "cites_id": ["17948219531632876294"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.2490", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bpu0_ZHiFPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
