This could create an inconsistency as much as 300 W/m2 between radiative transfer modelling and pyrheliometer measurements, having further ramifications for the validation of surface solar irradiance data derived from various sources such as sky imaging camera, satellite and numerical weather prediction models. In addition, accurate modelling of the angular pattern of solar irradiance within a very small angle from the centre of the sun is important for solar energy generation using concentrating (thermal or photovoltaic) technologies. This article presents an analytical model for the calculation of circumsolar radiation, based on the \u2018small angle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17250336732120728549", "cites_id": ["17250336732120728549"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667113121000012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5cPtldyBZe8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
