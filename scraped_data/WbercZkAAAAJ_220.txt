This product provides modelled estimates of the potential surface water impacts of likely coal resource developments in the Gloucester subregion.First, the methods are summarised and existing models are reviewed, followed by details regarding the development of the model. The product concludes with predictions of the hydrological characteristics of the system that may change due to coal resource development (referred to as hydrological response variables) also taking into account uncertainty."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6445661299486666742", "cites_id": ["6445661299486666742"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/174807/1/174807.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9q9iIs2Wc1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
