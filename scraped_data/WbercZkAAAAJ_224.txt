If a time series is well calibrated, data are especially valuable to detect and interpret long term environmental changes. These data can be used operationally as a decision support tool for policy makers. The Web-CATS (CSIRO AVHRR Time Series) project provides access to the Australian AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data archive via the World Wide Web. The data archive consists of multiple satellite overpasses from several receiving stations in Australia for almost every day since July 1981 and is still growing. The data are held online, so that products can be processed on-demand in a user-customised manner with state-of-the-art algorithms. The user is presented with a list of the possible processing operations which are implemented in CAPS (Common AVHRR Processing Software). Users can search and browse a meta-database of the archived satellite passes and specify processing parameters for their desired data product. The architecture of Web-CATS is highly modular; so that the program (with slight modification) can be used to provide a Web-based delivery system for other long-term high-frequency environmental remote sensing sensors, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Image Spectrometer), ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) or future missions.
