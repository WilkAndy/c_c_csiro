Australian Geological Survey Organisation, Canberra, Australia", "abstract": "Remotely sensed data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor was used to rapidly monitor and assess the 1997 drought experienced in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Data was purchased for a normal year (1996), the drought (1997) and for the year of recovery (1998). To overcome the problem of high amounts of cloud coverage experienced in the tropics, 4-week and 8-week composite data were used. The processing pathway developed in this project, which has been transferred to local scientists, is fully documented in this report. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface temperature (Ts) were both used. To utilise the negative correlation exhibited between these two variables the ratio of Ts/NDVI was plotted as a time series and mapped as time difference images. This provided a rapid indicator of drought, which does not require ancillary meteorological data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8800878875219006241", "cites_id": ["8800878875219006241"], "pub_url": "http://grapevine.com.au/~pbierwirth/png_dght.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IROrPLUAI3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1}}
