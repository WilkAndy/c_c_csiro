The issue of satellite-ground mismatch, though previously recognized, has not been given sufficient attention in the relevant scientific literature due to: (i) satellite SSI have mostly focused on relatively longer-term data, such as hourly, daily and longer; and/or (ii) most studies assessed only global (or total) irradiance. Also, studies addressing this satellite-ground mismatch issue often require a dense ground network to characterize the spatial representativeness of ground measurements, which likely limited performing such studies. With shorter-term satellite SSI data, such \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8364957653700803562", "cites_id": ["8364957653700803562"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722002917", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6nsFpqpMFnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
