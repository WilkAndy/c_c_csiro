(2020) estimate irrigation water use from satellite remotely sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration in five irrigated districts of the Murray-Darling Basin (southeast Australia). They used three models that scale crop reference evapotranspiration with vegetation indices acquired by recent Landsat satellites: (i) IrriSAT, (ii) Kamble and (iii) CMRSET. In their paper, irrigation water use computed with CMRSET generally overestimated observed irrigation water use, sometimes fivefold. Based on these results, Bretreger et al. (2020) discouraged the use of CMRSET for irrigation monitoring. In this comment, we reproduce the experiments in Bretreger et al. (2020), and demonstrate that their overestimation was because they used an incorrect Landsat band in their implementation of CMRSET. CMRSET was originally calibrated using both MODIS-derived \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6133198076599630211", "cites_id": ["6133198076599630211"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421010945", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g3nU1Cd_HVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
