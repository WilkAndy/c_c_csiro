The SEDI has been proposed recently to quantify drought severity based on the difference between actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the atmospheric evaporative demand (AED). Our findings demonstrate that, regardless of the AED dataset used for calculations, a log-logistic distribution is needed in order to fit the ED time series."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5954267506327441240", "cites_id": ["5954267506327441240"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab6a/e3971d50fdf94738f08af75217e170b444ba.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WE9M_L_OoVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
