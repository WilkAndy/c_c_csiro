In addition to observational characteristics, important operational characteristics often also exist, such as data availability and the cost of purchase; data latency; reliability; data format; degree of validation and acceptance; and Interpretability and uncertainty. Types of data obtained from earth observation include categories of precipitation; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; vegetation and vegetation cover; groundwater; surface water; snow; and optical water quality and macrophytes. Raw data such as sensor measurements received directly from the satellite becomes processed to top of atmosphere (TOA) data with conversion to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1817684553401145236", "cites_id": ["1817684553401145236"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-0475-5_ch6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lJcwh3i2ORkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
