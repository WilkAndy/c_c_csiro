The AWRA landscape model (AWRA-L)(Van Dijk 2010) simulates the water and energy fluxes on a daily time step. The current configuration in AWRA-L includes two main land cover types, or hydrological response units (HRUs) which occupy each grid-cell (~ 5 km) in a certain proportion: tall, deep-rooted vegetation and short, shallow-rooted vegetation. This paper presents results of firstly, an assessment, intercomparison and evaluation against observations (from airborne Lidar) of two alternative sources of land cover information to represent the proportions of deep and shallow-rooted vegetation and secondly, an empirical method to resolve the relative contribution of each land cover type into the albedo, greenness and leaf area \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1673996685891285287", "cites_id": ["1673996685891285287"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116536&sb=RECENT&n=10&rpp=50&page=51&tr=4054&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JzG72R07OxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
