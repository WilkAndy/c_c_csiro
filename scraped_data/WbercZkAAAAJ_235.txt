Fusion of data from different satellites allows improvement of spectral, spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the acquired imagery, thereby increasing the quality of information used for analysis. Traditional fusion methods integrate only spectral and spatial properties of concurrent images acquired from multiple sensors. Recently developed fusion models, such as STARFM (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) and its enhanced version, ESTARFM, also incorporate temporal information to predict surface reflectance at Landsat spatial resolution (~ 25 m) and MODIS temporal frequency (~ daily)(Gao et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2010). ESTARFM produces more accurate predictions compared to STARFM especially for heterogeneous landscapes and is now considered the \u201cindustry standard\u201d. Such a fusion model is very valuable for monitoring hydrological dynamics (eg, actual evapotranspiration (ETa)) at finer spatial and temporal resolution. However, there are two reasons which may prevent the widespread operational use of ESTARFM:(i) the model is quite time consuming; it takes 10 to 60 hours to predict a Landsat-like image of about 2000 x 2000 pixels; and (ii) it requires Landsat data to be atmospherically corrected, which can be a time consuming task."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11114315685003468948", "cites_id": ["11114315685003468948"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina-Emelyanova/publication/235955972_Emelyanova_Poster_WIRADA_symp_Aug2011_final/links/00b49514bacc5766ad000000/Emelyanova-Poster-WIRADA-symp-Aug2011-final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lCAvtjr7PZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
