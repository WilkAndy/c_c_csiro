In order to undertake this work, time series data sets of AET were solicited from science teams active in the field. This report provides reference documentation for the data sets contributed as of June 2010. It does NOT include quantitative or qualitative assessment of the data sets, either individually or relative to one another; that material will be the subject of a subsequent report. In order to enable extension to include additional data sets contributed in the future, it is intended that this reference document will become an on-line resource on the project web site.Specific documentation for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11659181965815986174", "cites_id": ["11659181965815986174"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11659181965815986174&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_jcalDm8zaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
