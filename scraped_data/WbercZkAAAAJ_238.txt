Although the spectral information and cost of these remote sensing data are attractive, their spatial resolutions are often perceived as being inadequate for agricultural management at both the individual holding and the paddock level in the rice areas of New South Wales (NSW). Conversely, fine resolution remote sensing (e.g., aerial photography) very often contain spatial detail that will allow management decisions to be made at the paddock level, but these data can be expensive to acquire and subsequent manual digitisation of crop areas is labour intensive when performed each year. This raises at least two associated research questions for the rice industry in southern NSW: (1) \u2018how is the rice area best mapped when considering cost, accuracy, timing, and complexity while reconciling the above issues? \u2018; and (2) \u2018how can spatial accuracy (concerning both areas and positions) be measured and related to relevant management practices in order to influence decisions?\u2019. Additionally, many operational users of remote sensing data perceive it as being an overwhelming data source as it often requires time consuming training and expensive computer software. This results in a further series of issues: (3) \u2018can remote sensing be used operationally within the NSW rice industry so that simple methods can be applied using inexpensive software with minimal training in order to achieve similar or increased accuracies?\u2019.
