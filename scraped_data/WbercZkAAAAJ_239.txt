A time series of Hyperion imagery has been acquired over the CIA during the entire 2001/2002 southern hemisphere summer growing season. Extensive spectral ground sampling was performed to validate the spectral signatures derived by Hyperion. In this paper, we describe the basic processing steps that have been applied to geometrically and atmospherically correct the data and reduce the effects of noise prior to investigating the time series of specific measures of crop productivity through its biochemistry."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12849336333996297901", "cites_id": ["12849336333996297901"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1025113/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rY5eK1EDUrIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1}}
