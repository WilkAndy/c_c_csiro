Cloud parameters were retrieved from satellite data, and SSI calculated using radiative transfer through look-up-tables. Detailed validation using 3 years of high quality 1-minute surface measurements at 11 stations across Australia consistently showed low bias (\u2264 5 W/m 2 ) across timescales for all SSI components, and rapidly reducing RMSE with increasing averaging period. Issues in validation using in-situ measurements will be discussed. We will also present an accurate analytical model for the calculation of circumsolar radiance applicable to clear and cloudy sky conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16755581539440315898", "cites_id": ["16755581539440315898"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8981315/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-s1un6LIh-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
