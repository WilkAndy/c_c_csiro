Besides the usual surface characteristics, such as topography, land subsidence, and others, earth observation can address eight key hydrometeorological variables relevant to WRM applications: precipitation; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; vegetation, land use, and land cover; groundwater; surface water; snow and ice; and water quality. Water-related topics and subtopics considered in the World Bank context include water supply for rural or urban water users; sanitation and hygiene; agricultural water management, in irrigation or in rain-fed agriculture; water resources management and environmental services, including aquatic ecosystems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16861655094387342585", "cites_id": ["16861655094387342585"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-0475-5_ch5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-fwcsvihAOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
