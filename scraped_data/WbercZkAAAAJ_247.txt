In order to be able to quantify\u2013and perhaps even predict\u2013such changes across the vast Australian continent, the effects of these processes on the carbon and water cycles need to be modelled. This report describes the modelling of these two cycles across Australia\u2019s forests, woodlands and rangelands under current climatic conditions and under two hypothetical future climatic conditions.Modelling of the carbon cycle was performed using the steady state carbon balance model \u2018VAST\u2019(Barrett, 2011). VAST represents the landscape using ten carbon stores\u2013two above-ground biomass stores, two above-ground litter stores and three stores each of below-ground biomass and soil carbon (C). In addition, VAST estimates the fluxes between each store. The water cycle is modelled using the BCP model (Donohue et al., 2012) that estimates the steady state water fluxes (that is, the partitioning of precipitation between actual evaporation and runoff)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1468430130975831360", "cites_id": ["1468430130975831360"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP125130&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QHVLjmzpYBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
