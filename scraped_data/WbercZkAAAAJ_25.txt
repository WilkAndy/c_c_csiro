However, these same models also predict an increased runoff\u2013. This contradiction has been linked to an absence of vegetation responses to an elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] in offline impact models,,,. Here we report a close and consistent relationship between changes in surface resistance (rs) and [CO2] across 16 CMIP5 models. Attributing evapotranspiration changes under non-water-limited conditions shows that an increase in evapotranspiration caused by a warming-induced vapour pressure deficit increase is almost entirely offset by a decrease in evapotranspiration caused by increased rs driven by rising [CO2]. This indicates that climate models do not actually project increased vegetation water use under an elevated [CO2], which counters the perception \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10864348786533058303", "cites_id": ["10864348786533058303"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0361-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_8Y_2ajrxZYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 18, "2020": 47, "2021": 64, "2022": 86, "2023": 34}}
