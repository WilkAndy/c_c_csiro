To assess how remotely sensed data can be used, a review of current inter-national uses of remotely sensed data was made and several topics requiring further research by remote sensing specialists identi\ufb01ed. Consequently, the review focuses on current techniques used by Australian agencies, and also assesses current international methods, as well as proposing some possible new research directions that may use remote sensing for drought assessment and management. The primary scienti\ufb01c information that remote sensing can provide is the estimation of vegetation cover and condition, soil moisture, and the spatial limits to drought exceptional circumstances.\u00a9 I998 Elsevier Science Ltd \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=848204266613737444", "cites_id": ["848204266613737444"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=848204266613737444&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Id7WEltxQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
