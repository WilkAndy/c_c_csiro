Field and wind-tunnel experiments with predefined conditions have been presented in the literature, however this research uses a real case study to assess the impact of anemometer changes on wind speed measurements due to three factors being: (i) the 3-cup anemometer model (SEAC vs. THIES companies); (ii) sensor height (\u223c19.95 m vs. \u223c20.45 m) and (iii) sensor age (20-years old vs. new). Our results show (a) substantial biases in the measured wind speed and daily peak wind gusts, with the new THIES anemometer reporting stronger surface winds than the old SEAC anemometer; (b) opposing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809523001680", "cites_per_year": {}}
