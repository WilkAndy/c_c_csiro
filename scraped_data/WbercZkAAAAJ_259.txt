Following a continuous reduction ('stilling') of global annual mean surface wind speed (SWS) since the 1960s, recently, researchers have reported a'reversal'since 2011. However, little attention has been paid to the evolution of the effective wind speed for wind turbines. Since wind speed at hub height increases with SWS through power law, we focus on the wind speed frequency variations at various ranges of SWS through hourly in-situ observations and quantify their contributions to the average SWS changes over 1981\u20132021. We found that during the stilling period (here 1981\u20132010), the strong SWS (\u2a7e 5.0 ms\u2212 1, the 80th of global SWS) with decreasing frequency contributed 220.37% to the continuous weakening \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acc9d5/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
