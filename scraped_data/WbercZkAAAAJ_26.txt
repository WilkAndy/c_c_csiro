However, these studies generally used streamflow observations from a relatively small number of catchments (<200) located in small, homogeneous study areas, which may have led to less reliable models with limited applicability elsewhere. Here, we use streamflow observations from a highly heterogeneous set of 3394 catchments (<10,000 km2) worldwide to construct reliable, widely applicable models based on 18 climatic and physiographic characteristics to estimate two important base flow characteristics: (1) the base flow index (BFI), defined as the ratio of long\u2010term mean base flow to total streamflow; and (2) the base flow recession constant (k), defined as the rate of base flow decay.
