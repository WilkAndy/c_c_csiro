Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-Optical data fusion models predict the missing reflectance values through the correlation between optical images and cloud-insensitive SAR images often using deep learning to train the model. However, most existing SAR-Optical data fusion methods did not incorporate temporal correlation optimally as they were not trained on dense and localized time-series data. Herein, we develop a new SAR-Optical data fusion method that incorporated spatial, temporal, and cross-data-source correlation in the same framework. The method uses spatio-temporal (ST) partitioning and pixel-wise multiple linear regression (MLR) and is named ST-MLR. The parsimonious structure of ST-MLR provides training-efficient model development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271623000618", "cites_per_year": {}}
