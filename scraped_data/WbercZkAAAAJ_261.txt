As a key variable in the CR, Epo estimates by conventional models have a long\u2010standing problem in practical applications. That is, the meteorological forcings (i.e., radiation and temperature) employed in conventional Epo models are observed under actual conditions that are generally not saturated. Hence, conventional Epo models do not conform to the original definition of Epo (i.e., the evaporation that would occur with an unlimited water supply). Here, we estimate Epo using the maximum evaporation approach (Epo_max) that does follow the original Epo definition. We find that adopting Epo_max considerably reduces the asymmetry of the CR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022WR033763", "cites_per_year": {}}
