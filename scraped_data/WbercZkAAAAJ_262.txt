However, currently there is no all-Spain gridded NSWS observation product with higher spatial coverage than station-based wind series. A new methodological approach based on image reconstruction using artificial intelligence could help to solve this limitation. We use a partial convolutional neural network (PCNN) and station-based NSWS series from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) to create a 0.1\u00ba daily gridded wind speed observation product over Spain for 1961-2021. The deep neural network is trained with wind data from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (at 9-km grid-spacing, ECMWF), and a mask where grid points with historical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-5860.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
