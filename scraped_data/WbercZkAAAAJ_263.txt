The historical maps (1901\u20131930, 1931\u20131960, 1961\u20131990, 1991\u20132020) are based on high-resolution, observation-based climatologies, while the future maps (2041\u20132070 and 2071\u20132099) are based on downscaled and bias-corrected climate projections for seven shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We evaluated 64 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and kept a subset of 40 with the most plausible CO 2-induced warming rates. Under the \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d scenario SSP2-4.5, the global land surface area (excluding Antarctica) with suitable climatic conditions for tropical, arid, temperate, cold, and polar vegetation is projected to show a net change of+ 9%,+ 3%,\u2212 3%,\u2212 2%,\u2212 33%, respectively, in 2071\u20132099 (with respect to 1991 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-2271.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
