As a typical sharp zonal aridity gradient, China\u2019s Hu Line effectively divides the country into the arid northwest and the humid southeast and has exerted profound impacts on human settlement, agricultural and socio-economic development. Previous studies of regions experiencing sharp zonal aridity gradients (e.g., the 100th meridian in the USA and the Sahel belt in Northern Africa) reported significant and widespread aridity changes in the context of anthropogenic climate change, yet how changes in aridity may geographically shift the Hu Line remains unknown. Here we assess the historical and future shifts of the Hu Line from agroecological, atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives. Our results show that the effective arid-humid divide from the agroecological perspective has moved northwest with a mean shift of 0.48\u00b0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216942201160X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SFbx2_eUsbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
