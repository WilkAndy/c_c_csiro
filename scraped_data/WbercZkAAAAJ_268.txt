Here, observed near-surface (at 10 m height) DMWS from 115 meteorological stations and combined DMSP/OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System) and NPP/VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) nighttime light data from 1992-2016 in Yangtze River Delta, a rapidly urbanized area of China, were used to analyze the impact of urbanization on DMWS variability. Raw wind speed observations were subject to a robust quality control and homogenization protocol using the Climatol package. The stations were firstly classified into six urbanized groups by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..2213005Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
