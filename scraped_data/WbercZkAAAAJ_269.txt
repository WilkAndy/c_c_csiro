This climate trend has mainly been observed over mid-latitude continental surfaces since the 1980s. On the contrary, other studies have detected an increase in wind speed over ocean surfaces; and there is little conclusive scientific evidence on trends in wind speed across the troposphere. Furthermore, a reversal in global terrestrial stilling has recently been documented in few regional and global studies since the 2010s. The causes associated with the climate variability of wind speed have not yet been resolved and there are many uncertainties behind the \u00abstilling\u00bb and \u00abrecovery\u00bb phenomenon because neither the quantity nor the quality of wind speed observations is adequate. This contribution shows an overview of the IBER-STILLING project (RTI2018-095749 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..22.5056A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
