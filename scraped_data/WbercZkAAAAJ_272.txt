These studies have generally taken the meteorological output from fully coupled climate models and used that to calculate potential evaporation. In general, potential evaporation increases with warming because of increasing vapour pressure deficit and when this trend is put into a drought impact model, the model predicts increasing aridity into the future. This is the basis for the commonly held view that aridity and drought both increase in a high CO2 world. In contrast, the original (fully-coupled) climate model output projects a global average trend for increased vegetation productivity and slightly more water in rivers, ie, a less arid future. This difference is known as the aridity paradox. Here we show that the aridity paradox is resolved when meteorological and biological factors are used jointly to calculate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140481352&h=3JVxkt93slfcoQNO4nCD%2FwM0DrmGlH%2BaZeoNEJ6ItpP1NlFddad2J31SVAwJwSja0iM5m6nJ8DjlltsMmGv2Vg%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
