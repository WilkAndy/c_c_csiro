Here, wind speed trends in North China and their relationships with the uneven warming are analyzed using data from 690 stations for 1961-2016. Raw wind speed observations were subject to a robust quality control and homogenization protocol using the Climatol package. The results show that surface wind speed has significantly (p< 0.05) declined by-0.103 m s-1 decade-1 annually, with significant (p< 0.05) negative trends in all seasons, particularly in spring (-0.137 m s-1 decade-1) and winter (-109 m s-1 decade-1), followed by autumn (-0.086 m s-1 decade-1) and summer (-0.078 m s-1 decade-1). Rapid warming occurred in the high latitude region over the last decades which weakened the pressure gradient between high and low latitude regions and the vertical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140490199&h=bTyINqiZp2UdoYnBf0OXwOaqpN8CAxKi1nHum%2FPhpwKytNxHHDX0o6JBhIWXqIqKKEKIMNg73%2F1WgsHzBTos9w%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
