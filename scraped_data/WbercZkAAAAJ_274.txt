Yet wind time series analyses can be impacted by several artefacts, such as anemometer changes and site location changes, both temporally and spatially, that may introduce inhomogeneities that mislead the study of their decadal variability and trends. A previous study (EGU2018-14546) presented a strategy in the homogenization of this challenging climate extreme such as the DPWG using 548 time series across Australia for 1941-2016. The automatic homogenization of this DPWG dataset was implemented in the recently developed version 3.1 of the R package Climatol which:(i) represents an advance in homogenization of this extreme climate record; and (ii) produced the first homogenized DPWG dataset to assess and attribute long-term \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140490053&h=xAqJhkPZv4nHbF21c0o9RfIpZpCdA8Cenq8VyZYksGfjccKWiv7xmHCjzBIATUyfzMQj4exaWB%2B4kyCHdV0MNQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
