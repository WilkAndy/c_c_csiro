Many of the studies looking at wind variability has used in situ observations from terrestrial anemometers, but many instrumental issues affect their homogeneity. Moreover, it is also challenging to detect regional differences, as available wind records are not spatially homogeneous across the globe. For these reasons, global reanalysis products represent a potential tool for assessing global changes in near-surface winds with full spatial resolution, if their ability in realistically reproducing observed near-surface wind changes and in consistently representing spatial patterns of the changes can be demonstrated. In this study global near-surface wind speed changes have been analyzed using 7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140485149&h=OTmV9IGnw1F9n%2FI8kkgWOcfLtdZar0dBDdqqVu0OE1KiY8MDoCLZ7xWLnNhphYPDpgK8b6U%2FVLy%2BFNctUvlWJQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
