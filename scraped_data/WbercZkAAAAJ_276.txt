In this study, remote sensing technologies have been deployed to assess the spatial and temporal variabilities of biomass production using a radiation use efficiency approach. We developed a semi-empirical model to estimate the yield of the three major crop types in dryland Australia by integrating biomass with Stress Indices (SI) related to drought, heat, and frost. We identified crop-specific SI for critical phenological stages (eg anthesis and grain filling) to explain the impact of high spatial heterogeneities in the ecology and environment on the actual grain yield across the country. Our model explained 84, 69 and 79% of the observed variability at field-scale with root mean square error (RMSE) of~ 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 t/ha for canola \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140481840&h=zTB6BVqtT5ZzWaZyFdYJ%2BmwjOnxVtuBs8er6nz5cN2Kh2fGKIQW10R0KCtqLhkMGrKedBHlXNhg9mahszpaCAw%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
