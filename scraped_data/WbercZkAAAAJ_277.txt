High temporal and spatial variability in grain production makes nationwide crop yield prediction challenging. The present study developed a model combining semi-physical and empirical approaches to estimate yield of major crops (ie, canola, wheat and barley) across the Australian dryland wheatbelt using a remote sensing (RS) based radiation use efficiency approach and meteorology-driven Stress Indices (SI). Crop specific stress indices (eg, drought, heat and cold stress) in critical months (eg, anthesis and grain-filling) were used to explain the impact of highly variable (in both space and time) actual grain yield across the wheatbelt. The present model, Crop-SI, reduces the field-scale prediction error rate by~ 20% when compared with existing models for nationwide crop yield simulations. Our finding have improved the predictive capability of RS-based models for crop yield for a wide range of variability in meteorological conditions by incorporating rainfall and temperature into the simulation and provides new insights for the next-generation of nationwide agricultural yield models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2019/2019ASA_Chen_Yang_84.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LTBbeJRgOqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
