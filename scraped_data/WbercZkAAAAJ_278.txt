To understand their respective roles of each drvien factor has on the hydrological cycle a large number of partitioning studies have been conducted. However, the scattered case studies only provide local-to-regional understanding of the contributions of climate changes and human activities to streamflow variations. To better understand these absolute and relative impacts across the terrestrial globe we reviewed 103 studies providing access to 1321 catchment cases, and performed both simple correlation analysis and meta-analysis. We found that over the past decades (mainly from1930s to 2000s) streamflow generally decreased: the mean global annual streamflow change rate due to both climate changes and human activities was-0.15 mm. a-2 (using 62 studies). On average, climate changes increased global mean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.H41N2303W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
