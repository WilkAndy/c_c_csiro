Remote sensing technologies have been deployed to assess production, to provide insight about the near real time monitoring of crop growth at field scale and at regional scale. However, the sensors deployed for regional assessment historically differ from those used to perform a local assessment of crop growth. A continental-scale grain yield estimation with a high temporal and spatial resolution is barely mentioned in current literature, because high spatial resolution sensors are constrained by revisit time and cloud cover, and vice versa. This study evaluated the relative performance of MODIS, Landsat, and MODIS-Landsat (ML) blended images to monitor crop yield at field and national scales.
