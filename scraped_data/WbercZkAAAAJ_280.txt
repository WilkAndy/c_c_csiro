However the magnitude of this ratio remains highly uncertain at the global scale. Here, we apply an emergent constraint approach integrating CMIP5 climate models with T/ET measurements across 33 field sites to re-estimate the global T/ET value. Our observational constraint strongly increases original ESM estimates (0.41+/-0.11, mean 1 SD) and greatly alleviates inter-model discrepancy, leading to a new global T/ET estimate of 0.62+/-0.06. The global re-estimate of T/ET constrained by isotopic observations only (0.71+/-0.07) is, however, larger than that constrained by non-isotopic observations only (0.60+/-0.06), owing to the fact that isotopic approaches often diagnose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.H51Q1543L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
