Receptor impact models enable the Bioregional Assessment Programme (the Programme) to quantify the potential impacts and risks that coal resource developments pose to water-dependent landscape classes and ecological assets. Using receptor impact models to investigate landscapes provides a better understanding of how changes in hydrology may result in changes in ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/sites/default/files/ba-nsb-glo-270-receptormodelling-20180504a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IpsMPLTN_6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
