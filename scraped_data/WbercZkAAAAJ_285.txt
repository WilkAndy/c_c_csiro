This weakening in wind speed has been recently termed the \u201cstilling\u201d phenomenon, with a worldwide average trend of -0.140 m s-1 decade-1 reported since the 1960s. The precise causes of this \u201cstilling\u201d remain largely uncertain and have been hypothetically attributed to several factors, mainly related to an increase in surface roughness (i.e. forest growth, land use changes, and urbanization) with little attention paid to changes in atmospheric circulation. Unlike this \u201cstilling\u201d over land, satellite measurements have revealed that wind speed has increased over ocean surfaces, which introduces uncertainty to the \u201cstilling\u201d debate. Therefore, scientists are currently debating if global warming has and will impact on changes in wind speed.The uncertainty on the causes driving the \u201cstilling\u201d over land is mainly due to short availability (i.e. since the 1960s) and low quality of observed wind speed records as stated by the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the recent report \u201cState of the Climate in 2015\u201d . The main objective of the ongoing EU funded project STILLING (MSCAIF-2015 GA-703733) is to fill the key gap of short availability and low quality of wind speed datasets, and improve the limited knowledge on the causes driving the \u201cstilling\u201d in a climate change scenario. This has not yet been addressed by the scientific community due to (i) scientists have traditionally paid little attention on variability of wind speed; (ii) digitization of climate series at National Weather Services (NWS) systematically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repositorio.aemet.es/handle/20.500.11765/11954", "cites_per_year": {}}
