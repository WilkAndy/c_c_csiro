Here we show that such a framework can also be used to describe the carbon cycle. Based on a rate-limitation framework, we developed a Budyko-like analytical framework for estimating mean annual terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), which is the largest carbon flux over land. Actual GPP (climatological mean from 1982 to 2010) is calculated as a function of the balance between two GPP potentials defined by the climate (ie, precipitation and solar radiation) and a third parameter that encodes other environmental variables and modifies the GPP-climate relationship. The developed framework was tested at three spatial scales using different GPP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.H53K..08Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
