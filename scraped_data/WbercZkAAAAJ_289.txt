To shed light on the AED variability in Estonia we have studied the spatial and temporal variability of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from 1951 to 2015. We have computed ET0 from 9 high-quality meteorological stations by means of a Penman\u2013Monteith equation. We have analysed the spatial and temporal variability of ET0 and its main drivers ie maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind speed, sunshine duration, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure. ET0, at annual and country scale, shows a positive and significant trend with a magnitude of change during the studied period of 5.3 mm decade-1, with the highest values during the spring (4.1 mm decade-1). High significant correlation (r= 0.7-0.8) has been found among computed ET0 and observed pan evaporation (Epan) during the period 1968-2005. ET0 is highly correlated with sunshine (positive), relative humidity (negative) and maximum temperature (positive). Meanwhile sunshine has no significant trend, maximum temperature shows positive and significant trend in all the series and seasons and relative humidity shows significant negative trends in 8 of the 9 series studied in spring."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://sciforum.net/manuscripts/4860/manuscript.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IG69dbAFxvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
