On that approach the underlying cause of the enhanced greenhouse effect, that is, increasing atmospheric CO2 tends to be ignored. But laboratory experiments have long shown that increasing CO2 has a large impact on vegetation gas exchange, by, for example, increasing water use efficiency of photosynthesis. This tends to be a forgotten factor in the meteorological and hydrologic sciences. In this talk we outline some key expected effects of atmospheric CO2 on leaf-, canopy-and catchment-scale fluxes and compare those expectations with both site-(eg FACE) and catchment-scale observations. We find the expected effects have been observed over undisturbed vegetation. However, we find the effects of elevated CO2 are more complex in disturbed vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19..475R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
