Moreover, Zr observations are usually only representative of a single plant or several plants, which can differ greatly from the effective Zr over a modelling unit (eg, catchment or grid-box). Here, we provide a global parameterization of an analytical Zr model that balances the marginal carbon cost and benefit of deeper roots, and produce a climatological (ie, 1982-2010 average) global Zr map. To test the Zr estimates, we apply the estimated Zr in a highly transparent hydrological model (ie, the Budyko-Choudhury-Porporato (BCP) model) to estimate mean annual actual evapotranspiration (E) across the globe. We then compare the estimated E with both water balance-based E observations at 32 major catchments and satellite \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.4217Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
