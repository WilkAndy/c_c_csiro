Understanding the impacts on agriculture, natural ecological communities and water resources presents considerable challenges. We investigate this problem using a Budyko-type framework based around two end-members:(i) warm arid environments (eg warm deserts) and (ii) warm wet environments (eg tropical rainforests). We first make predictions of the effect of a change in atmospheric CO2 on the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration and streamflow. We then use satellite observation of greenness and in-situ streamflow data to assess the predictions. We finish by contrasting the observed responses against those expected from a purely theoretical construct: the so-called optimal vegetation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B52D..05R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
