Since EO-based solutions do not always apply, precursor questions address the nature of the problem and the existing data; a key question asks whether the required data or information products can be generated from remote sensing (RS) at all. Eight core data characteristics can help establish the suitability of data for a predetermined task: spatial resolution, frequency and timing, record length, field data requirements, data product reliability, data product accuracy, data product maturity, and data product complexity. Sensor specific characteristics depend on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-0475-5_ch7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EEZzFn67DYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
