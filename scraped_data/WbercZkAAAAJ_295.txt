Thus, understanding how tropical rainforests respond to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) is essential for predicting Earth's carbon, water and energy budgets under future climate change. While the Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technique has greatly advanced our understanding of how boreal and temperate ecosystems respond to eCO2, there are currently no FACE sites available in tropical rainforest ecosystems. Here we firstly examine the trend in long-term (1982-2010) satellite-observed leaf area index and fraction of vegetation light absorption and find only minor changes in these variables in tropical rainforests over years, suggesting that eCO2 has not increased vegetation leaf area in tropical rainforests and therefore any plant response to eCO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.5331Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
