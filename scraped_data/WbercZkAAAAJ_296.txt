Actual GPP (climatological mean from 1982 to 2010) is calculated as a function of the balance between two GPP potentials defined by the climate (ie, precipitation and solar radiation) and a third parameter that encodes other environmental variables and modifies the GPP-climate relationship. The developed model was tested at three spatial scales using different GPP sources, ie,(1) observed GPP from 94 flux-sites,(2) modelled GPP (using the model-tree-ensemble approach) at 48654 (0.5 degree) grid-cells and (3) at 32 large catchments across the globe.
