Importantly, technical products from BAs are also expected to be made available to the public, providing the opportunity for all other interested parties, including government regulators, industry, community and the general public, to draw from a single set of accessible information. A BA is a scientific analysis, providing a baseline level of information on the ecology, hydrology, geology and hydrogeology of a bioregion with explicit assessment of the potential impacts of CSG and coal mining development on water resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.bioregionalassessments.gov.au/sites/default/files/ba-nsb-hun-130-descriptionwaterdependentassets-20160624.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7ddOgGgkUdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
