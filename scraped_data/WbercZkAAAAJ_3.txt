Several recent studies have shown that declining rates of evaporative demand are primarily governed by trends in the aerodynamic component (primarily being the combination of the effects of wind speed (u) and atmospheric humidity) and secondarily by changes in the radiative component. A number of these studies also show that declining rates of observed near-surface u (termed \u2018stilling\u2019) is the primary factor contributing to declining rates of evaporative demand. One objective of this paper was to review and synthesise the literature to assess whether stilling is a globally widespread phenomenon. We analysed 148 studies reporting terrestrial u trends from across the globe (with uneven and incomplete spatial distribution and differing periods of measurement) and found that the average trend \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 1096, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15292364730512038600", "cites_id": ["15292364730512038600"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411007487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yNrhMbNkOdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 25, "2013": 47, "2014": 58, "2015": 86, "2016": 92, "2017": 122, "2018": 140, "2019": 119, "2020": 115, "2021": 124, "2022": 113, "2023": 50}}
