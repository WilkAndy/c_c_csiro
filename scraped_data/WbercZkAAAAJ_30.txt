Topographic accuracy, methods of preparation and grid size are all important for hydrodynamic models to efficiently replicate flow processes. In remote and data-scarce regions, high resolution DEMs are often not available and therefore it is necessary to evaluate lower resolution data such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for use within hydrodynamic models. This paper does this in three ways: (i) assessing point accuracy and geometric co-registration error of the original DEMs; (ii) quantifying the effects of DEM preparation methods (vegetation smoothed and hydrologically-corrected) on hydrodynamic modelling relative accuracy; and (iii) quantifying the effect of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2751180939264162790", "cites_id": ["2751180939264162790"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415001614", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5nuq5XwoLiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 24, "2017": 20, "2018": 27, "2019": 35, "2020": 35, "2021": 26, "2022": 28, "2023": 12}}
