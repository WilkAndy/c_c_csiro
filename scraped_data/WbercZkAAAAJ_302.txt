Across water-limited environments, droughts result in declines in vegetation productivity and cover. However, observations indicate that productivity and cover have, on average, been increasing across the globe's water-limited regions. This raises the question of what the relationship is between drought and vegetation, and how might vegetation-water dynamics change as global warming progresses. Of particular interest is the role that CO2 fertilisation has in changing landscape-scale vegetation water use. We will present both observation-and model-based analyses of the possible CO2-driven changes in vegetation cover, productivity and water use."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.H34D..04D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
