An increase in the substrate availability would, with all else equal, stimulate fixation of carbon from the atmosphere. But all else is not necessarily equal and this is only the beginning of a cascade of changes that can ultimately be traced back to the stomatal regulation of water-carbon exchanges. We first discuss theoretical expectations and then deduce how vegetation might respond to changing CO2 in water-and energy-limited environments. We then use satellite observations to test the theoretical expectations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.H14C..03R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
