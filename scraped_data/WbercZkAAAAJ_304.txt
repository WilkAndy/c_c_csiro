The HBV-light model was chosen because of its parsimony and flexibility to test the schemes. The catchments were calibrated against observed streamflow (Q) using an objective function incorporating both behavioral and goodness-of-fit measures, after which the catchment set was split into subsets of 1215 donor and 2113 evaluation catchments based on the calibration performance. The donor catchments were subsequently used to derive parameter sets that were transferred to similar grid cells based on a similarity measure incorporating climatic and physiographic characteristics, thereby producing parameter maps with global coverage. Overall, there was a lack of suitable donor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.9364B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
