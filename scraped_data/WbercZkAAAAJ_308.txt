The region supports 80% of the human population and regularly experiences extreme events such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. These changes in the hydrological cycle affect water supply for urban population centres, reduce economic activities and threaten water-dependent ecosystems. An important question that emerges from these issues is how human-modified, spatially heterogeneous catchments are responding to hydrological changes and which biophysical factors are driving the streamflow response. In order to organize and classify heterogeneous catchments with regard to their hydrological functioning, this study utilizes daily streamflow and rainfall time series to quantify hydrological similarity across 402 catchments located along the east \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.H43I1065T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
