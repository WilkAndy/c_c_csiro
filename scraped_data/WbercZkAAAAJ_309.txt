For arid environments, where the main limit to growth is the supply of water, this' fertilisation'effect is expected to enhance overall vegetation cover and carbon capture, but there is no clear consensus on how the water cycle will be affected. Here, we present a simple model of how vegetation cover and carbon and water fluxes change with CO2 concentration, and we predict the historical (1982-2010) changes in these across the globe's warm, dry environments. We test this model using concurrent satellite-derived vegetation cover data, processed to separate the CO2-driven changes in cover from changes associated with other dominant drivers (namely, precipitation and disturbances).
