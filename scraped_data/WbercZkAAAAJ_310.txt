Rising levels of Ca directly affect plant functioning and these effects cascade into all the rest of the ecosystem. A major mechanism for this is through stomatal closure in response to elevated Ca, which should result into increased soil moisture availability. The water savings lead to increased soil water storage in the deeper soil layers and ultimately increase surface runoff. The hypothesised water savings phenomenon is hotly debated, since the reduction in transpiration per unit of foliar area could be counterbalance by an increase in leaf area index (LAI) or increased understorey transpiration. To address these hypotheses, we conducted a large-scale CO2 enrichment experiment (FACE) in a water-limited ecosystem in Australia. We quantified the impact of elevated Ca on ecosystem water use and storage within the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014EGUGA..1611055G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
