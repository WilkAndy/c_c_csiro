A random forest classification was implemented using learning samples inferred from Landsat TM/ETM data and monthly time-series of remotely-sensed observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The covariates included in the method characterised:(i) the vegetation phenology via the recurrent and persistent fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (fPARrecandfPARper, respectively);(ii) vegetation water use via estimates of actual evapotranspiration (AET), rainfall (P) and the difference between AET and P. Maps of irrigated areas under different climates and cropping conditions were produced for the whole Murray-Darling Basin (Australia) for the years 2004 to 2010 with 0.96 observed agreement in terms of the Kappa Index \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014EGUGA..1616623P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
