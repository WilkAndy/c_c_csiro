Under water-limited conditions the predictions are straightforward with evapotranspiration approaching rainfall leaving little water for runoff. Under energy-limited conditions the predictions are more complex. Importantly, the rate of evapotranspiration from vegetated surfaces is known to be sensitive to the atmospheric [CO2]. The ongoing rise in atmospheric [CO2] has been so fast that it is now time to reconsider incorporating the plant response into a Budyko style framework. Incorporating what is essentially a biological response to [CO2] into the physically-based Budyko framework represents a conceptual challenge. In this talk we outline why the vegetation response is important and consider some approaches to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.H11A1146R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
