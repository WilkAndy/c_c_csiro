Blending algorithms have been developed to overcome this limitation by predicting the composition of higher spatial and temporal resolution band data by blending individual corresponding bands of two sensors. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of two advanced algorithms (STARFM and ESTARFM) in blending single bands and indices to downscale MODIS pixels (250-500 m) to Landsat resolution (28.5 m). We test two approaches to predicting indices: i) Index-Simulate (IS)-(ie, indices directly predicted including EVI, NDVI NDWI24 and NDWI 27) from Landsat-MODIS pairs) and ii) Simulate-Index (SI)-(ie indices were calculated from five predicted bands (Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared and Mid-Infrared).
