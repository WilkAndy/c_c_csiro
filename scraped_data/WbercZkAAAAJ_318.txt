EOI TCP Client Report EP138192", "pub_year": 2013, "citation": "CSIRO, Australia, 2013", "author": "EA Lehmann and TR McVicar and GS Chiu and IV Emelyanova and TG Van Niel and KS Bakar and BL Henderson", "publisher": "CSIRO, Australia", "abstract": "Data fusion represents the concept of integrating multiple data streams that measure the same real-world process into a single and consistent composite representation. It is generally expected that the resulting information product will exhibit enhanced qualities or characteristics (eg, in terms of accuracy or completeness) compared to the individual sources of input data, and that accurate measures of its uncertainty are simultaneously produced that truthfully account for the blending model used as well as the error characteristics of the individual input components.Earth Observation (EO) entails the acquisition of information about Earth\u2019s physical, chemical and biological systems, and EO datasets typically provide a wealth of measurements for a wide array of environmental variables in water, on land or in the atmosphere. Exacerbating this multiplicity, these data are typically acquired by a myriad of satellites, airborne platforms and in situ sensors, each with their own intrinsic characteristics and operated by numerous countries and institutions, which leads to large volumes of mostly heterogeneous information."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP138192&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zkC1foZflngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
