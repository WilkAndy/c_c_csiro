Land surface models (LSMs) provide estimates of soil moisture and evaporative fluxes for the continent, but model constraints are limited to data from a small number of scattered in-situ monitoring sites (eg, gauged catchments and flux towers). Other potential data sources to constrain LSMs are the indirect measurements from remote sensing systems. Satellite-based remote sensing data have the advantage of continental spatial coverage and sub-daily observation frequency. However, with the exception of some spectral radiance-based image products, LSM outputs rarely match what is measured by the satellite sensor. Therefore, if these data are to be of use, it is necessary to either develop retrieval \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010EGUGA..12.5672R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
