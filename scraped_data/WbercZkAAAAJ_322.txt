This re-vegetation process will not only result in less soil erosion in the coarse sandy hilly catchments (CSHC), but also less runoff due to increased evapotranspiration (ET). A water balance model of Zhang et al.(2001) was used to estimate the subsequent impact on stream-flow and its spatial distribution in this region at first, but the results showed that the model was not able to accurately simulate average annual stream-flow when compared with stream-flow measurements from 38 hydrologic stations in CSHC of the Loess Plateau. Zhang et al.(2008) calibrated the model, and it can accurately simulate the impacts of the region on stream-flow.
