Observations included top soil water content and vegetation vigour derived from passive microwave satellite observations since 1979, remotely sensed gravity anomalies (indicative of changes in soil water and groundwater storage) since 2002, and evapotranspiration estimates derived by fusing on-ground and different types of satellite observations since 1992, along with climate and hydrometric records over several decades. Changes were assessed in the context of natural variability, ocean circulation and climate trends using statistical methods and land surface models. The observations show underlying trends of reduced water availability in eastern Australia and increases in northern Australia.
