That decline impacts evaporative demand of the terrestrial hydrological cycle. Wind speed is difficult to measure so how do we know that these trends are not artefacts? To address that question we developed, for the first time, high resolution daily continental scale wind maps (McVicar et al. 2008). In this paper we:(1) describe why wind is important for the hydrological cycle;(2) describe the evidence for terrestrial\" stilling\" supplemented by our\" world-first\" continental scale wind maps;(3) show that the observed terrestrial trends are not captured by various reanalysis schemes, and;(4) show that formulations of potential evapotranspiration that both include and ignore wind speed trends have substantially different patterns."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFMGC42A..08R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
