We introduce a Boolean model, which uses a thin plate smoothing spline interpolation method to model the distribution of precipitation and temperature and analyze the suitability of 38 species using GIS techniques considering the requirement of these species for environmental conditions. Then we overlay a single suitability map of these 38 species to obtain a species frequency map for a specific site. In our study, we mean with \u2018high frequency\u2019 a high suitability of a site for revegetation. The results show that we can model the spatial changes of vegetation suitability with a combination of topographic analyses based on DEM and GIS functions. We also demonstrate these spatial changes on the screen using Visual Basic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11461-008-0033-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iQv3RS1KI2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
