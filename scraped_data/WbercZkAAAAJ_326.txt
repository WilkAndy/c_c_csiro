Temporal analysis has many uses in the assessment of land resources, ie analysis of repeated observations, determination of the permanence of the living biomass above the ground, and estimation of the growth rates and land use change. The selection and calibration of imagery, and the methodology for temporal analysis are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083119382", "cites_per_year": {}}
