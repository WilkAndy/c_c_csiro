This is particularly true in an increasingly CO2-rich atmosphere where vegetation is expected to respond directly to changes in atmospheric [CO2], potentially altering hydrological regimes, even in the absence of changes in primary hydrological drivers like rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. How vegetation will respond is likely to differ between energy-and water-limited environments. By incorporating satellite-based measures of vegetation with hydro-meteorological observations across Australia, this talk will examine how vegetation has responded to climatic changes over the past 25 years. We will identify some emergent patterns and comment on the conceivable future eco-hydrological responses to climate change in water-limited \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.H33K..07D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
