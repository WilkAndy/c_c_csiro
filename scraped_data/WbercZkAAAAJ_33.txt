An analytical framework for assessing the sensitivity of runoff to changes in average precipitation and potential evaporation has recently been developed. This framework is based on Budyko\u2019s curve. It makes no assumptions about future climatic conditions and is simple to implement. Here we apply it spatially to the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia, for average 1981\u20132006 conditions, to gauge the differences in runoff sensitivity across different yield zones. The framework contains a catchment-specific parameter which is difficult to predict, and estimates of its value are explored and assessed. Results emphasise the importance of the spatial variation in runoff sensitivity. Due to the MDB\u2019s aridity, basin-average runoff is very low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 202, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13764164781553425100", "cites_id": ["13764164781553425100"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411004306", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zBpvcvEiBL8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 16, "2013": 12, "2014": 15, "2015": 17, "2016": 16, "2017": 25, "2018": 18, "2019": 9, "2020": 20, "2021": 26, "2022": 10, "2023": 11}}
