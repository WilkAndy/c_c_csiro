Remotely sensed measures of vegetation can be made across large areas and repeatedly through time and have great potential as a means of incorporating vegetation dynamics into such models. In particular, satellite-based red and near-infrared reflectances can be used to measure the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR). fPAR is related to photosynthesis and transpiration and therefore to vegetation productivity and water use. The separate contributions to these fluxes from persistent (quasi-perennial) and recurrent vegetation (quasi-annual) can be estimated by time-series analysis of fPAR data. We are testing the hypothesis that, when integrated into Budyko's \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.H21D1399D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
