Taking the piedmont plain of the Taihang Mountain in the northern part of the NCP as an example, the groundwater table is declining at a rate up to 1 m per year. Groundwater resources could be depleted in 20\u201330 years at such a rate. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to adopt water-saving practices in the NCP to maintain current agricultural sustainability to feed the increasing population. The Chinese Government has been aware of this problem and has supported many research projects to analyse factors contributing to groundwater depletion and to find effective water-saving measures. This paper reports our efforts to develop and implement water-saving agriculture in the piedmont of Taihang Mountain where long-term field experiments, monitoring and extension have been conducted, including matching crop rotation systems to climate pattern, better irrigation scheduling and methods, no-till technology to reduce soil evaporation, and highly water-use efficient cultivars. These techniques have shown great potential for water-saving in the NCP as demonstrated at the Luancheng Experimental Station in the piedmont of Taihang Mountain."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/node/726/pr123_pdf_76579.pdf#page=13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IQRKULYQZKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
