There is an urgent need to evaluate cropland quality so that land can be taxed and managed using up-to-date information. In China, different agricultural areas are taxed at different rates, based on land evaluation assessment. Farmers on more favourable land pay higher levels of tax. This chapter describes how 15 parameters were integrated into basic polygons to create a database for use in land evaluation. The parameters were obtained mainly from the national land survey and included accumulated annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil organic matter, elevation, slope and soil erosion. We evaluated cropland for each of the polygons using ArcInfo and Foxbase, integrated the database with an aggregated model produced from cropland evaluation of Shaanxi Province and created maps of cropland classes and related tables of statistics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=061640a3fc57fbd6507232d9faef7bfc00764cf2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H_DsXc_SeroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
