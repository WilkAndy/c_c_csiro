These variables include spectral reflectance from the atmospheric correction algorithms, broadband albedos converted from narrowband albedos, and leaf area index. The field campaign at Coleambally, Australia as part of the validation activities will also be described. ALI corresponds to the Landsat7/ETM+ sensor, its advantages for estimating these land surface variables over ETM+ will be demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/978202/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:diZM3RF_aLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
