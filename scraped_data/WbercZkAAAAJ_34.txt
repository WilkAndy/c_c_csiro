Wind speed series were subjected to quality control, reconstruction, and homogenization using a novel procedure that incorporated the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University\u2013National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)-simulated series as reference. The resultant series show a slight downward trend for both 1961\u20132011 (\u22120.016 m s             \u22121             decade             \u22121             ) and 1979\u20132008 (\u22120.010 m s             \u22121             decade             \u22121             ). However, differences between seasons with declining values in winter and spring, and increasing trends in summer and autumn, were observed.
