Our initial database of daily P gauge observations comprised 149,095 gauges worldwide and was compiled from (i) the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) dataset (ftp. ncdc. noaa. gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/) 61 (102,954 gauges),(ii) the Global Summary Of the Day (GSOD) dataset (https://data. noaa. gov; 24,730 gauges),(iii) the Latin American Climate Assessment & Dataset (LACA&D) dataset (http://lacad. ciifen. org/; 231 gauges),(iv) the Chile Climate Data Library (www. climatedatalibrary. cl; 716 gauges), and (v) national datasets for Brazil (11,678 gauges; www. snirh. gov. br/hidroweb/apresentacao), Mexico (5398 gauges), Peru (255 gauges), and Iran (3133 gauges). Our initial database of hourly P gauge observations (resampled to 3-hourly) comprised 14,350 gauges from the Global Sub-Daily Rainfall (GSDR) dataset 62 produced as part of the INTElligent use of climate models for adaptatioN to non-Stationary hydrological Extremes (INTENSE) project 63.Gauge data can have considerable measurement errors and therefore quality control is important 64\u201366. To eliminate long series of erroneous zeros frequently present in daily GSOD records 67, 68, we calculated a central moving mean with a one-year window (assigning a value only if at least half a year of values were present), and discarded daily and 3-hourly P observations with a coincident moving mean of zero. To eliminate long series of P without zeros, indicative of biased reporting practices or quality control issues, we calculated a central moving minimum with a one-year window (assigning a value only if at least \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/66369419/s41597-020-00631-x.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LlCk4LcFE0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
