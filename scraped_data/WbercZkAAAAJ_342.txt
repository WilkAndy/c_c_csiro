It has been the diet of Nigerians for centuries, despite that the production systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (to which Nigeria belongs) often lack use of mechanized operations. In this study, some Engineering properties of three maize grain varieties (Hybrid white oba super, yellow extra and white early variety drought tolerant) were determined. The properties investigated were the physical, gravimetric and mechanical properties. The tests were conducted in the processing laboratory of Agricultural Engineering Bayero University, Kano. Standard test procedures were followed in determining each of the properties. The mean values obtained for Hybrid white oba super variety for the length, width, thickness, equivalent diameter, surface area, sphericity, solid density, bulk density, porosity, angle of repose, horizontal compressive strength, vertical compressive strength, horizontal hardness and vertical hardness are 10.72 mm, 8.32 mm, 3.98 mm, 7.08 mm, 156.69 mm2, 0.66, 1295.98 Kgm-3, 789.67 Kgm-3, 39.06%, 22.60, 56.7 N, 66N, 0.3 N and 0.9 N. Similarly, the mean values for yellow extra variety are 10.02 mm, 8.50 mm, 4.27 mm, 7.18 mm, 161.9 mm2, 0.71, 1260.84 Kg m-3, 780.13 Kg m-3, 38.08%, 21.30, 32.7 N, 70N, 0.24 N and 0.22 N for those properties respectively. Similarly, the mean values for white early variety drought tolerant are 10.81 mm, 8.73 mm, 4.32 mm, 7.40 mm, 172.30 mm2, 0.69, 1189.31 Kgm-3, 778.53 Kgm-3, 35.85%, 23.170, 45.3 N, 45.4 N, 0.27 N and 0.26 N for those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rabi-Ahmad/publication/339662426_Determination_of_some_Engineering_Properties_of_Maize_grain/links/600d9435a6fdccdcb87a9d0d/Determination-of-some-Engineering-Properties-of-Maize-grain.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hpWAUrPSh6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
