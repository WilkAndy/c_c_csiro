Aerosols remain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate modelling. Air pollution in the form of aerosols have major impacts on human health. Aerosols provide critical information for the correction of atmospheric effects on remote sensing imagery. Remote sensing provides a practical means to measure aerosols at global scales and at high spatial resolution. The new generation of geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8/9, HY-4, GOES-R and MTG-I, presents new opportunities to map aerosols in high temporal resolution with potentially high accuracy. However, aerosol mapping over land, especially over bright land such as the Australia continent, has been challenging due the dominating land surface which is highly variable over time, sun and view angles, and spectral wavelength. This work presents a multi-satellite approach combining GEO-LEO satellites to simultaneously retrieve aerosols and surface BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) over land."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www-cdn.eumetsat.int/files/2020-04/pdf_conf_2018_s6_qin_o.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
