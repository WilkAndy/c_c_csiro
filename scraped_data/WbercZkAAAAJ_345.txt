Here we use long-term (1982-2010) 32 precipitation (P) and runoff (Q) measurements to infer runoff coefficient (Q/P) and 33 evapotranspiration (E) trends across 18 unimpaired tropical rainforest catchments. We 34 complement that analysis by using satellite observations coupled with ecosystem 35 process modelling (using both \u2018top-down\u2019and \u2018bottom-up\u2019perspectives) to examine 36 trends in carbon uptake and relate that to the observed changes in Q/P and E. Our 37 results show there have been only minor changes in the satellite-observed canopy leaf 38 area over 1982-2010, suggesting that eCO2 has not increased vegetation leaf area in 39 tropical rainforests and therefore any plant response to eCO2 occurs at the leaf-level. 40 Meanwhile, observed Q/P and E also remained relatively constant in the 18 41 catchments, implying an unchanged hydrological partitioning and thus approximately 42 conserved transpiration under eCO2. For the same period, using a \u2018top-down\u2019model 43 based on gas-exchange theory, we predict increases in plant assimilation (A) and light-44 use efficiency (\u03b5) at the leaf-level under eCO2, the magnitude of which is essentially 45 that of eCO2 (ie.,~ 12% over 1982-2010). Simulations from ten state-of-the-art 46 \u2018bottom-up\u2019ecosystem models over the same catchments also show the direct effect 47 of eCO2 is to mostly increase A and \u03b5 with little impact on E.
