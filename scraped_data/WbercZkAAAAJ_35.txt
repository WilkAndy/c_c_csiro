However, its magnitude remains highly uncertain at the global scale. Here we apply an emergent constraint approach that integrates CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) with 33 field T/ET measurements to re-estimate the global T/ET value. Our observational constraint strongly increases the original ESM estimates (0.41\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11) and greatly alleviates intermodel discrepancy, which leads to a new global T/ET estimate of 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06. For all the ESMs, the leaf area index is identified as the primary driver of spatial variations of T/ET, but to correct its bias generates a larger T/ET underestimation than the original ESM output. We present evidence that the ESM underestimation of T/ET is, instead, attributable to inaccurate representation of canopy light use, interception loss and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7105055225801518912", "cites_id": ["7105055225801518912"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0207-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QK9uaxU6mmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 23, "2020": 39, "2021": 41, "2022": 61, "2023": 23}}
