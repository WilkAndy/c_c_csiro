However, comparatively little research has been performed on determining the best time(s) of image acquisition for crop discrimination even though this could impact classification accuracy as much as choice of clustering algorithm or selection of training data, for example. This case study was conducted to: (1) determine temporal windows for highest overall and individual crop discrimination; and (2) compare simple methods for combining best single-date results to increase overall accuracy. Seventeen single-date classifications of four major summer crops (rice, maize, sorghum, and soybeans) were assessed for a single growing season at the Coleambally Irrigation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11745791883790398364", "cites_id": ["11745791883790398364"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169904000948", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nDP-hnxvAaMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 10, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 10, "2014": 12, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 15, "2018": 15, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
