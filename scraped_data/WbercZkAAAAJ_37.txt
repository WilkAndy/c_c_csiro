In this Review, we synthesize observational and modelling evidence to demonstrate emerging differences in dryland aridity dependent on the specific metric considered. Although warming heightens vapour pressure deficit and, thus, atmospheric demand for water in both the observations and the projections, these changes do not wholly propagate to exacerbate soil moisture and runoff deficits. Moreover, counter-intuitively, many arid ecosystems have exhibited significant greening and enhanced vegetation productivity since the 1980s. Such divergence between atmospheric and ecohydrological aridity changes can primarily be related to moisture limitations by dry soils and plant physiological regulations of evapotranspiration under elevated CO2. The latter process ameliorates water stress on plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7030622090223472572", "cites_id": ["7030622090223472572"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00144-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vM_IjYrJkWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 31, "2022": 93, "2023": 60}}
