Additionally, Zr observations are usually only representative of a single plant or several plants, which can differ greatly from the effective Zr over a modeling unit (e.g., catchment or grid\u2010box). Here, we provide a global parameterization of an analytical Zr model that balances the marginal carbon cost and benefit of deeper roots, and produce a climatological (i.e., 1982\u20132010 average) global Zr map. To test the Zr estimates, we apply the estimated Zr in a highly transparent hydrological model (i.e., the Budyko\u2010Choudhury\u2010Porporato (BCP) model) to estimate mean annual actual evapotranspiration (E) across the globe. We then compare the estimated E with both water balance\u2010based E observations at 32 major catchments and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 171, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12462716072387081350", "cites_id": ["12462716072387081350"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016WR019392", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hvQuzzx29KwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 13, "2018": 15, "2019": 22, "2020": 34, "2021": 34, "2022": 37, "2023": 11}}
