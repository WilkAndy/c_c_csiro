Hyperion can provide effective measures of agricultural performance through the use of established spectral indexes if systematic and random noise is managed. The noise management strategy includes recognition of \"bad\" pixels, reducing the effects of vertical striping, and compensation for atmospheric effects in the data. It also aims to reduce compounding of these effects by image processing. As the noise structure is different for Hyperion's two spectrometers, noise reduction methods are best applied to each separately. Results show that a local destriping algorithm reduces striping noise without introducing unwanted effects in the image. They also show how data smoothing can clean the data and how careful selection of stable Hyperion bands can minimize residual atmospheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 615, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3648333839062277253", "cites_id": ["3648333839062277253"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1220232/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hRxYA0x8oTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 8, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 25, "2008": 37, "2009": 33, "2010": 29, "2011": 28, "2012": 38, "2013": 39, "2014": 44, "2015": 47, "2016": 33, "2017": 43, "2018": 41, "2019": 37, "2020": 26, "2021": 33, "2022": 25, "2023": 11}}
