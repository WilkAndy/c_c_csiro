The answer is that the evaporative process is primarily driven by radiative and aerodynamic components (the latter mainly influenced by wind speed and atmospheric humidity). So, although increases in air temperatures in isolation would result in increases of both pan evaporation (Epan) observations, and fully physically based model estimates of potential evapotranspiration (ETp), results show that changes in the other meteorological variables governing AED are currently exerting a greater opposing influence. Widespread declines in wind speed (denoted \u2018stilling\u2019) of ~\u22120.014\u2009m\u2009s\u22121\u2009a\u22121 have recently been reported. In studies assessing the relative contribution of the four primary meteorological variables on AED dynamics, wind speed trends are often indentified as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11605566572947220125", "cites_id": ["11605566572947220125"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1298", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:naaqJU9BD6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 21, "2017": 19, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 23, "2021": 18, "2022": 20, "2023": 3}}
