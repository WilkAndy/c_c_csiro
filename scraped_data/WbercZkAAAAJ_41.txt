Emergency famine relief operations provided many subsistence agricultural communities with food, water and health provisions during the height of the drought. The locations of relief operations were based on a rapid and spatially explicit extensive field survey conducted at the height of the drought for all PNG. We have tested the utility of composite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data to assist in a rapid assessment of drought conditions in PNG. Composited data were used to provide a means to overcome the frequent cloudy conditions that exist in PNG. To assess the drought we divided land surface temperatures (T s) by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The ratio (T s/NDVI) increases during times of drought. This is due to the increase in T s associated with more net radiation being partitioned into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15930694519590771772", "cites_id": ["15930694519590771772"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160120728", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PFx42UIyFd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
