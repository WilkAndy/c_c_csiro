Using numerous variables derived from three primary time-series variables (precipitation, potential evaporation and remotely sensed estimates of vegetation cover), linear one-variable models are developed to explain the variability in stream flow predictions not already captured by the Budyko model (the \u2018scatter\u2019). Analyses are applied to 221 catchments across Australia and cover the period 1981\u20132006. At the annual average temporal scale, results show that vegetation-related variables are not the primary determinants of scatter at coarse spatial scales (i.e., continental), and that little improvement could be made on the original Budyko model. However, at medium spatial scales vegetation-related \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8719448823715884258", "cites_id": ["8719448823715884258"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410003604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4mzI7oG0AXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 14, "2013": 7, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 19, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 9, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
