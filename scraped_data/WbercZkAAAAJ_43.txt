We tested two approaches: (i) \u201cIndex-then-Blend\u201d (IB); and (ii) \u201cBlend-then-Index\u201d (BI) when simulating nine indices, which are widely used for vegetation studies, environmental moisture assessment and standing water identification. Landsat-like indices, generated using both IB and BI, were simulated on 45 dates in total from three sites. The outputs were then compared with indices calculated from observed Landsat data and pixel-to-pixel accuracy of each simulation was assessed by calculating the: (i) bias; (ii) R2; and (iii) Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). The IB approach produced higher accuracies than the BI approach for both blending algorithms for all nine indices at all three sites. We also found that the relative performance of the STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms depended on the spatial and temporal variances of the Landsat-MODIS input indices. Our study suggests that the IB approach should be implemented for blending of environmental indices, as it was: (i) less computationally expensive due to blending single indices rather than multiple bands; (ii) more accurate due to less error propagation; and (iii) less sensitive to the choice of algorithm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11371785459453650979", "cites_id": ["11371785459453650979"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/81294", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I-ivBKCy0J0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 11, "2018": 29, "2019": 12, "2020": 16, "2021": 23, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
