Monitoring vegetation fractional cover continuously across large areas needs good remote sensing techniques underpinned by high quality field data to calibrate and validate algorithms. Here Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance data together with 1171 field observations across Australia were used to estimate vegetation fractional cover using a linear unmixing technique. The aim was to estimate the fractions of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV and NPV, respectively) and the remaining fraction of bare soil (BS). Landsat surface reflectance was averaged over a 3 \u00d7 3 pixel window representing the field area measured and also \u201cdegraded\u201d using a 17 \u00d7 17 pixel window (~ 0.26 km2) to approximate the coarser MODIS sensor's response.
