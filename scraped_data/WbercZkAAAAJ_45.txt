Times of interest include the afternoon, when Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data are acquired, and mid-morning, when LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) data are acquired. Using data from sites in Australia and China, it has been shown how: (1) air temperature (Ta) at these times can be estimated effectively using the model of Parton and Logan [Parton, W.J., Logan, J.A., 1981. Agric. For. Meteorol. 23, 205\u2013216]. This model only uses daily maximum (Tx) and minimum (Tn) air temperatures as inputs; (2) to calculate relative humidity (h), dew \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12935275629052075478", "cites_id": ["12935275629052075478"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192399000520", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1p1qjaZUg7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 8, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
