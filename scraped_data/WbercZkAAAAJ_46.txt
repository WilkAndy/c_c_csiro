The algorithm relies on spectral reflectances and a six biome land cover classification. Evaluation of the specific behaviour and performance of the product for regions of the globe such as Australia are needed to assist with product refinement and validation. We made an assessment of Collection 4 of the MODIS LAI product using four approaches: (a) assessment against a continental scale Structural Classification of Australian Vegetation (SCAV); (b) assessment against a continental scale land use classification (LUC); (c) assessment against historical field-based measurement of LAI collected prior to the Terra Mission; and (d) direct comparison of MODIS LAI with coincident field measurements of LAI, mostly from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8606955571174672137", "cites_id": ["8606955571174672137"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425706000368", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CYdviX0McncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 14, "2011": 13, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
