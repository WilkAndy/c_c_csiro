The monthly uZ were calculated from 1960\u20132006. In both regions uZ were higher in winter (\u223c2.25 m s\u22121 km\u22121) compared to summer (\u223c1.25 m s\u22121 km\u22121). For the first time uZ trends were calculated, the results were strongly seasonal, ranging from \u223c\u22120.025 m s\u22121 km\u22121 a\u22121 in winter to \u223c\u22120.005 m s\u22121 km\u22121 a\u22121 in summer. For both regions uZ trend results showed that u has declined more rapidly at higher than lower elevations, even though different u dynamics were observed. The uZ trends have important implications for climatic changes of coupled land\u2010surface/boundary\u2010layer processes (such as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7802960732544794757", "cites_id": ["7802960732544794757"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL042255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hYCnw3GvSWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 15, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 14, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
