Since the 1950s the island of Puerto Rico has experienced widespread abandonment of pastures and agricultural lands, followed by forest regeneration. This paper examines the possible impacts of these secondary forests on several Q characteristics for 12 mesoscale catchments (23\u2013346 km2; mean precipitation 1720\u20133422 mm yr\u22121) with long (33\u201351 yr) and simultaneous records for Q, precipitation (P), potential evaporation (PET), and land cover. A simple spatially-lumped, conceptual rainfall\u2013runoff model that uses daily P and PET time series as inputs (HBV-light) was used to simulate Q for each catchment. Annual time series of observed and simulated values of four Q characteristics were calculated. A least-squares trend was fitted through annual time series of the residual difference between observed and simulated time series of each Q characteristic. From this the total cumulative change (\u00c2) was calculated, representing the change in each Q characteristic after controlling for climate variability and water storage carry-over effects between years. Negative values of \u00c2 were found for most catchments and Q characteristics, suggesting enhanced actual evaporation overall following forest regeneration. However, correlations between changes in urban or forest area and values of \u00c2 were insignificant (p \u2265 0.389) for all Q characteristics. This suggests there is no convincing evidence that changes in the chosen Q characteristics in these Puerto Rican catchments can be ascribed to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6173626968268656179", "cites_id": ["6173626968268656179"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2613/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M85sswQhrVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 20, "2017": 20, "2018": 17, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 17, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
