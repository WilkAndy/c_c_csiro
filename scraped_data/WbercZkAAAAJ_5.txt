Topics include estimating actual evaporation from deep lakes and from farm dams and for catchment water balance studies, estimating potential evaporation as input to rainfall-runoff models, and reference crop evapotranspiration for small irrigation areas, and for irrigation within large irrigation districts. Inspiration for this guide arose in response to the authors' experiences in reviewing research papers and consulting reports where estimation of the actual evaporation component in catchment and water balance studies was often inadequately handled. Practical guides using consistent terminology that cover both theory and practice are not readily available. Here we provide such a guide, which is divided into three parts. The first part provides background theory and an outline of the conceptual models of potential evaporation of Penman, Penman\u2013Monteith and Priestley\u2013Taylor, as well as discussions of reference crop evapotranspiration and Class-A pan evaporation. The last two sub-sections in this first part include techniques to estimate actual evaporation from (i) open-surface water and (ii) landscapes and catchments (Morton and the advection-aridity models). The second part addresses topics confronting a practicing hydrologist, e.g. estimating actual evaporation for deep lakes, shallow lakes and farm dams, lakes covered with vegetation, catchments, irrigation areas and bare soil. The third part addresses six related issues: (i) automatic (hard wired \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 569, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6128665407558671319", "cites_id": ["6128665407558671319"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/1331/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:11vClLdkDVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 20, "2015": 52, "2016": 54, "2017": 64, "2018": 71, "2019": 74, "2020": 76, "2021": 63, "2022": 64, "2023": 22}}
