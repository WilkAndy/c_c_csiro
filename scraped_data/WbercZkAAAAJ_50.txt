AED is a complex concept and here we discuss possible AED definitions, the subsequent metrics to measure and estimate AED, and the different physical drivers that control it. The complex influence of AED on meteorological, environmental/agricultural and hydrological droughts is discussed, stressing the important spatial differences related to the climatological conditions. Likewise, AED influence on drought has implications regarding how different drought metrics consider AED in their attempts to quantify drought severity. Throughout the article, we assess literature findings with respect to: (a) recent drought trends and future projections; (b) the several uncertainties related to data availability; (c) the sensitivity of current drought metrics to AED; and (d) possible roles that both the radiative and physiological effects of increasing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4359988220609842004", "cites_id": ["4359988220609842004"], "pub_url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VEtWui_KgTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 19, "2021": 32, "2022": 49, "2023": 19}}
