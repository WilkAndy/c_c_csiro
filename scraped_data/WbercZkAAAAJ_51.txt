Remotely sensed data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are combined with meteorological data to estimate the Normalised Difference Temperature Index (NDTI). The NDTI provides a measure of the moisture availability, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration. Surface temperature minus air temperature, percent vegetation cover and net radiation explained 85% of variation in the modelled NDTI. Using these three covariates across the network of meteorological stations allows NDTI images, which maps changes in moisture availability across the MDB, to be calculated. This method uses a calculate then interpolate (CI) approach that uses the per-pixel variation present in the AVHRR data as the backbone for the spatial interpolation.
