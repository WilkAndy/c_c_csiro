Wind gust series were homogenized on a daily basis, using MM5\u2010simulated series as reference, resulting in 80 suitable station\u2010based data sets. The average DPWG 90th percentile frequency declined by \u22121.49\u2009d\u2009decade\u22121 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) annually. This showed marked seasonal differences: decreasing in winter (\u22120.75\u2009d\u2009decade\u22121; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and increasing in summer (+0.18\u2009d\u2009decade\u22121; p\u2009>\u20090.10). A negligible trend was calculated for the annual magnitude of DPWG (\u22120.005\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 decade\u22121; p\u2009>\u20090.10), with distinct seasonality: declining in winter (\u22120.168\u2009m\u2009s \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11165745580082936613", "cites_id": ["11165745580082936613"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015jd024485", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JTs7SXKy9JoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 10, "2017": 12, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
