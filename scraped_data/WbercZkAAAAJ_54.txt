Confusion exists regarding the definition of three English words commonly used  to describe the vertical dimension: (1) elevation; (2) altitude; and (3) height.  While used interchangeably in \u201ceveryday\u201d non-technical English, here we provide explicit definitions and strongly recommend their use in scientific literature.  We briefly discuss the likely origins of the sub-optimal use of these three words due to translations between languages.  Finally, we provide examples of how using these terms, as explicitly defined herein, improves scientific communication."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9128474272965476577", "cites_id": ["9128474272965476577"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-012-2416-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4UBmjfzarn4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 17, "2016": 18, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
