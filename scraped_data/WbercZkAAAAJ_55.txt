Here, attribution analysis was conducted to investigate the contribution of the four key meteorological variables to changes of a physically-based Ep in a large water-limited basin, the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. Then the influences of these changes, and precipitation (P) changes, on streamflow (Q) were explored analytically. Results show that: (i) Ep presented different temporal trends for the water yielding region (WYR) and water consuming region (WCR) with a overall changes of +0.16mma\u22122 and \u22120.66mma\u22122 during 1961\u20132010, respectively; (ii) trend analysis of Ep and the four key meteorological variables at the basin scale showed that increasing trend in Ta increased Ep during 1961\u20132010, while changes in Rn and u \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9135369164138859340", "cites_id": ["9135369164138859340"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412006336", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TMuNgNpZx34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 14, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 8, "2020": 18, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
