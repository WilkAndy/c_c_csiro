Here we present a new method that performs a relative calibration of reflectance data to produce consistent long-term vegetation information. It is based on a simple biological framework that assumes that the position of the vegetation cover triangle is invariant in reflectance space. This assumption is in fact an intrinsic assumption behind the commonly used Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and is violated when the NDVI is calculated from inadequately corrected reflectance data. In this new method, any temporal variability in the position of the cover triangle is removed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2554584016282213912", "cites_id": ["2554584016282213912"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425708000618", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GF5kx6C0cyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 12, "2010": 6, "2011": 11, "2012": 13, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 10, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
