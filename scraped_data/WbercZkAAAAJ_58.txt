It has been widely assumed that the effect of sub-pixel misregistration between the two models on resultant image differences is negligible, yet this has not previously been tested in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the impact that various levels of misregistration have on image differences between SRTM and DEMs. First, very accurate image co-registration was performed at two study sites between higher resolution DEMs and SRTM data, and then image differences (SRTM\u2013DEM) were performed after various levels of misregistration were systematically introduced into the SRTM data. It was found that: (1) misregistration caused an erroneous and dominant correlation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7804588806969799139", "cites_id": ["7804588806969799139"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425707004725", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:47FsYSt4T2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 12, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 16, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
