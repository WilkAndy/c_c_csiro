Hence, there is an urgent need to know actual evapotranspiration (ETa) patterns across wide areas of agricultural and natural ecosystems, as opposed to just point measurements of ETa. The Australian Government has tasked the science agencies with operationally developing monthly and annual estimates of ETa and other hydrological variables, and with forecasting water availability over periods of days to decades, as part of its national water assessment programme. To meet these needs, Australian researchers have become leaders in developing large\u2010area methods for estimating ETa at regional and continental scales. Ground methods include meteorological models, eddy covariance towers, sap flow sensors and catchment water balance models. Remote sensing methods use thermal infrared, mid infrared and/or vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15137560878892624366", "cites_id": ["15137560878892624366"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.8391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7qk-yGprE9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
