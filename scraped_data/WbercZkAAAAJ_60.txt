Managers at these five levels of government need access to information to assist them to plan the land use change prior to performing on-ground activities. To this end, the suitability of 38 predominately native species in the 113,000km2 Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) has been mapped at a 100m resolution. In this data-sparse region, this was achieved by using a five-variable spatial overlay approach as we were able to readily access the required environmental variables and rule-set defining the species\u2019 requirements (or tolerances). As the rules did not consider optimal growth they were possibly \u2018too inclusive\u2019, so the spatial extent of areas suggested for re-planting was refined by defining \u2018target \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13919385126507800708", "cites_id": ["13919385126507800708"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709003338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hGhaRQaXK8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
