Here we derive an analytical solution for the impact of vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning within the Budyko framework. This is achieved by deriving an analytical expression between leaf area index (LAI) change and the Budyko land surface parameter (n) change, through the combination of a steady state ecohydrological model with an analytical carbon cost\u2010benefit model for plant rooting depth. Using China where vegetation coverage has experienced dramatic changes over the past two decades as a study case, we quantify the impact of LAI changes on the hydrological partitioning during 1982\u20132010 and predict the future influence of these changes for the 21st century using climate model projections. Results show that LAI change exhibits an increasing importance on altering hydrological partitioning as climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16711556537762273663", "cites_id": ["16711556537762273663"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017WR022028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f1ktJSFg6-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 13, "2021": 26, "2022": 30, "2023": 14}}
