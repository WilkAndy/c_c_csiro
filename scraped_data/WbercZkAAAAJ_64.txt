Advances in geospatial technology will play an increasingly important role in raising productivity and resource use efficiency and reducing environmental degradation, both worldwide and within Australia. This paper reviews the current use of one of these technologies, remote sensing, with the rice-growing region in Australia as a case study. Specifically, we review applications of remote sensing in crop identification, area measurement, regional yield forecasting, and on-farm productivity monitoring and management. Within this context, consideration is given to classification algorithms and accuracy assessment, hyperspectral remote sensing, positional and areal accuracy, linear mixture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1635148131253222032", "cites_id": ["1635148131253222032"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR03149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kPp93o82sRYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
