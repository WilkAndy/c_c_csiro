By using: (i) a simple eco-hydrological approach, (ii) an elasticity differential analysis, and (iii) a calibrated physically-based MIKESHE model, we have qualitatively and quantitatively isolated the relative contributions that land use change and climate change made to decadal streamflow changes in Chaohe watershed (4854 km2) located in northern China. This is an important watershed of Miyun Reservoir that supplies 70% of drinking water for Greater Beijing Area (Population over 19 M). The results suggested that streamflow of the watershed, compared with the reference period from 1963-1979, greatly decreased during 1980\u20131989 and 2000\u20132008, whilst it slightly changed during 1990\u20131999. The insignificant streamflow change for 1990\u20131999 was due to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6823171936405664758", "cites_id": ["6823171936405664758"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169413007373", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9rPftrnGsF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 14, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
