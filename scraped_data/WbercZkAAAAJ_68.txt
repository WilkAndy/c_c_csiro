Regional scale changes to the hydrological cycle of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia have occurred as a result of European settlement 200 years ago. Replacement of deep-rooted perennial plants (trees) by shallower rooting plants (pastures and cropping) is of particular significance in altering water-tables and causing waterlogging and secondary salinization. 2. The purpose was to locate the areas at risk of waterlogging and salinization as a result of tree clearing. To achieve this, present-day evaporation (ET) from 0.8% of the MDB (7750 km2) is compared with ET from a reconstruction of the pre-European condition. 3. The spatial geographical database for the 155 x 50 km study area consisted of vegetation, soils, climate and topographic information at 1.6 x 1.6 km cell resolution (3072 individual cells for each data layer). 4. Leaf area index (LAI) was used to define the amount of photosynthesizing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4792007939026355043", "cites_id": ["4792007939026355043"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2404630", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y4OE1tShgEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
