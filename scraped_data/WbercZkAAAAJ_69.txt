The well-known impact of cup anemometer drift (i.e., wear on the bearings) on the observed weakening of wind speed has been mentioned as a potential contributor to the declining trend. However, to date, no research has quantified its contribution to stilling based on measurements, which is most likely due to lack of quantification of the ageing effect. In this study, a 3-year field experiment (2014\u20132016) with 10-minute paired wind speed measurements from one new and one malfunctioned (i.e., old bearings) SEAC SV5 cup anemometer which has been used by the Spanish Meteorological Agency in automatic weather stations since mid-1980s, was developed for assessing for the first time the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12527821290140680144", "cites_id": ["12527821290140680144"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809517312401", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0D9pkBbD260J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 17, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
