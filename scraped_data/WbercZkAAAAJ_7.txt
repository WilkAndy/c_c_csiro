In this paper we review the Budyko curve's underlying framework and, based on the literature, present an argument for why it is important to include vegetation dynamics into the framework for some purposes. The Budyko framework assumes catchments are at steady-state and are driven by the macro-climate, two conditions dependent on the scales of application, such that the framework's reliability is greatest when applied using long-term averages (\u226b1 year) and to large catchments (>10 000 km2). At these scales previous experience has shown that the hydrological role of vegetation does not need to be explicitly considered within the framework. By demonstrating how dynamics in the leaf area, photosynthetic capacity and rooting depth of vegetation affect not only annual and seasonal vegetation water use, but also steady-state conditions, we argue that it is necessary to explicitly include vegetation dynamics into the Budyko framework before it is applied at small scales. Such adaptations would extend the framework not only to applications at small timescales and/or small catchments but to operational activities relating to vegetation and water management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:7H_MAutzIkAC", "num_citations": 529, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2233443687730320266", "cites_id": ["2233443687730320266"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/11/983/2007/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ihMBYTPJ_h4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 12, "2009": 19, "2010": 25, "2011": 35, "2012": 45, "2013": 35, "2014": 33, "2015": 41, "2016": 44, "2017": 39, "2018": 38, "2019": 30, "2020": 34, "2021": 42, "2022": 33, "2023": 16}}
