The Comet catchment (16,440km2) had 45% of the native woodland cleared during the mid-1960s. In the Upper Burdekin catchment (17,299km2) clearing decreased native woodland extent from 83% to 58% between 1998 and 2009. An earlier modelling study concluded that clearing in the Comet catchment increased annual streamflow by more than 40%. Here, several published inference methods to separate land use effects from climate variability were applied. Trend analysis of daily rainfall and streamflow data showed that interannual changes in mean streamflow in the Comet catchment were mostly due to changes in rainfall. In particular, a series of La Ni\u00f1a events after clearing led to an unusual lack of dry periods and an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6995062010873385823", "cites_id": ["6995062010873385823"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411008213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XxPwY9ZzE2EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
