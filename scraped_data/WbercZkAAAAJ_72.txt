The raw wind speed data set was subject to a robust homogenization protocol, and the stations were then classified under three categories: (1) coast, (2) inland and (3) mountain stations. The results reveal a statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduction of wind speed of \u22120.058\u2009m s\u22121 dec\u22121 at annual scale across SA, with decreases in winter (\u22120.100\u2009m s\u22121 dec\u22121) and spring (\u22120.066\u2009m s\u22121 dec\u22121) also detected, being non\u2010significant in summer and autumn. The coast, inland and mountain series showed similar magnitude and significance of the declining trends across all SA series, except for summer when a decoupled variability and opposite trends of wind speed between the coast and inland series (significant declines: \u22120.101\u2009m s\u22121 dec\u22121 and \u22120.065\u2009m s\u22121 dec\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9297687206647368407", "cites_id": ["9297687206647368407"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5423", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1wrp0EAFCIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
