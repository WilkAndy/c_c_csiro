To estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation. This study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging: in data-sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates, while in data-dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge. The uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall, the chloride exported in runoff, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16166493841024645556", "cites_id": ["16166493841024645556"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169417305292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tHnQoX7sWuAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 13, "2020": 18, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
