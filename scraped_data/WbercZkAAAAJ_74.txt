Here we use long\u2010term (1982\u20132010) precipitation (P) and runoff (Q) measurements to infer runoff coefficient (Q/P) and evapotranspiration (E) trends across 18 unimpaired tropical rainforest catchments. We complement that analysis by using satellite observations coupled with ecosystem process modeling (using both \u201ctop\u2010down\u201d and \u201cbottom\u2010up\u201d perspectives) to examine trends in carbon uptake and relate that to the observed changes in Q/P and E. Our results show there have been only minor changes in the satellite\u2010observed canopy leaf area over 1982\u20132010, suggesting that eCO2 has not increased vegetation leaf area in tropical rainforests and therefore any plant response to eCO2 occurs at the leaf level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13409878810197449043", "cites_id": ["13409878810197449043"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JG003475", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U1nbsrp1GboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 12, "2018": 16, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
