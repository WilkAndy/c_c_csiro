This is not trivial because thermal remote sensing data acquired under cloud-free daytime conditions require upscaling to a monthly energy amount that is both relevant over cloudy periods and considers daytime and nighttime. Previous work has compared upscaling approaches, but as yet there is no authoritative comparison that does so under conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing. In this paper we describe, under the conditions relevant for thermal remote sensing, a generic framework for comparing any upscaling approach that assumes self-preservation. Then we use eddy-flux data from two sites in contrasting climates to systematically evaluate the accuracy of different upscaling proposals within the framework \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7270810229239379865", "cites_id": ["7270810229239379865"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412006695", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mfcWj2Eb52QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 15, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
