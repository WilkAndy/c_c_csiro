Two critical parameters of the model are the vegetation index values of fully-vegetated and bare soil pixels (denoted Vx and Vn hereafter). These are commonly empirically set according to spatial and/or temporal statistics. The uncertainty and difficulty of accurately determining Vx and Vn in many ecosystems limits the accuracy of resultant FVC estimates and hence reduces the utility of VI-based mixture model for FVC estimation. Here, an improved method called MultiVI is developed to quantitatively estimate Vx and Vn from angular VI acquired at two viewing angles. The directional VI is calculated from the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43A1) data. The results of simulated evaluation with 10% added noise show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17298216439450206363", "cites_id": ["17298216439450206363"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718303006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m4BAqTOcD_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 12, "2020": 20, "2021": 20, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
