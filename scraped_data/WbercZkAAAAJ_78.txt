Two well-known hydrological theories underpinning these processes are the Budyko framework and the Dunne diagram. Relating the scaling of water\u2013energy balances (Budyko) and runoff generation mechanisms (Dunne) raises some important catchment comparison questions, namely: (i) how do streamflow characteristics vary according to the annual water and energy balances?; (ii) to what extent do biophysical drivers of runoff explain the observed streamflow variability?; and (iii) are there quantifiable process overlaps between these two approaches, and can they offer insights into the mechanics of catchment co-evolution? This study addresses these questions by analysing daily streamflow and precipitation time series data to quantify hydrological similarity across 355 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14269122362972274224", "cites_id": ["14269122362972274224"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169416300427", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MH6LJTAbBsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
