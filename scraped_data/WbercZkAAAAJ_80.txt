However, this self-preservation of the EF is only one of three major surface energy balance interactions that might introduce bias. The other two are differences between use of 24-h versus daytime-only available energy and latent heat flux. We used observations from two Australian long-term flux tower sites to assess the magnitude and interaction of the three factors. The difference between 24-h and daytime-only available energy caused the most error at the temperate forest site (median error: \u221218%) whereas the lack of self preservation of the EF caused the most error at the tropical savanna site (median error: \u221214%).
