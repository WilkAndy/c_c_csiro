Index-based methods resulted in higher accuracies early in the growing season when background moisture differences were at a maximum. Analysis of depth of ETM+ band 5 resulted in the highest accuracy over the growing season (97.74%). This was more accurate than the highest supervised classification accuracy (95.81%), demonstrating the usefulness of spectral feature selection of moisture for classifying rice."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=135389462858945178", "cites_id": ["135389462858945178"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0143116021000009921", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mtIJyP__4AEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 4}}
