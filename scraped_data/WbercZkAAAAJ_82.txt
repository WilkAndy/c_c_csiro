Recent regional and global assessments indicate that groundwater extraction (GWE) for irrigation has increased more rapidly than surface water extraction (SWE), potentially resulting in groundwater depletion. Irrigated agriculture in semi-arid and arid regions is usually from a combination of stored surface water and groundwater. This paper assesses the usefulness of remotely-sensed (RS) derived information on both irrigation dynamics and rates of actual evapotranspiration which are both input to a river-reach water balance model in order to quantify irrigation water use and water provenance (either surface water or groundwater). The assessment is implemented for the water-years 2004/05\u20132010/11 in five reaches of the Murray\u2013Darling Basin (Australia); a heavily regulated basin with large irrigated areas and periodic droughts and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12963019354771058854", "cites_id": ["12963019354771058854"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715309025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pnCkEWzl5bMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
