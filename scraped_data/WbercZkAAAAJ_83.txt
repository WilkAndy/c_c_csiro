In this study we observed a positive and statistically significant correlation between Pich\u00e9 and Pan evaporation measurements during the common period (1984\u20132011; 19 stations), mainly in summer. When evaporation observations and estimates were compared, we detected positive and statistically significant correlations with the four methods, except for winter. Among the four physical models, the FAO-Pan showed the best fitting to both Pich\u00e9 and Pan evaporation measurements; the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8349977731378433514", "cites_id": ["8349977731378433514"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415000633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6s07sYEU4XMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
