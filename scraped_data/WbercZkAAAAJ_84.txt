Considering the important role of vegetation in partitioning the catchment water yield, the recently developed Budyko-Choudhury-Porporato (or BCP) model incorporated Porporato\u2019s model of key ecohydrological processes into Choudury\u2019s form of the Budyko hydroclimatic framework. Here we extend the steady state BCP model by incorporating dynamic ecohydrological processes into it and combining it with a typical bucket soil water balance model (resulting in the dynamic BCP, or dBCP, model). The dBCP model is used here to assess the impacts of vegetation on the water balance in a temperate water-limited basin (i.e., the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in north China), where growing season phenology is primarily constrained by low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8808416334544642791", "cites_id": ["8808416334544642791"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169416306801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5yJIvvzHPXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 14, "2021": 6, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
