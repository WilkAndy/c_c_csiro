These losses include actual evaporation, infiltration to the soil and groundwater and residual (terminal) water remaining after flood events. These critical components of the water balance of dryland river systems remain largely unknown due to the scarcity of observational data and the difficulty in accurately accounting for the flow distribution in such large multi-channel floodplain systems. While hydrodynamic models can test hypotheses concerning the water balance of infrequent flood events, the scarcity of flow measurement data inhibits model calibration, constrains model accuracy and therefore utility. This paper provides a novel approach to this problem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7112576570828269287", "cites_id": ["7112576570828269287"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415006022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5yb8BbXytGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 12, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
