Anthropogenic climate change, in particular atmospheric warming, is projected to increase AI, which has in most cases been interpreted as increasing terrestrial aridity. In this study we demonstrate, for both past and future conditions, that such an interpretation requires reconsideration. Using catchment observations over the past 30 years and climate model projections for the 21st century, we show that increased AI does not ubiquitously lead to a decreased water availability over land, using surface runoff (Q) as an indicator. This is primarily caused by a higher Q sensitivity to changes in P (SP) and a lower Q sensitivity to changes in E0 (SE0), with the ratio of SP over SE0 being higher than the relative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13379206475511696099", "cites_id": ["13379206475511696099"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018WR022593", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4wp7RWd9rLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 13, "2020": 14, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
