Globally, some of these regions are experiencing declining precipitation yet are simultaneously becoming greener, partly due to vegetation feedbacks associated with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Reduced precipitation together with increasing rates of actual evapotranspiration diminishes streamflow, especially base flow, a critical freshwater dry\u2010season resource. Here we assess recent changes in base flow in Australia from 1981\u20132013 and 1950\u20132013 and separate the contribution of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and other factors on base flow trends. Our findings reveal that these other factors influencing the base flow trends are best explained by an increase in photosynthetic activity. These results provide the first robust observational evidence that increasing atmospheric CO2 and its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14754962158832737230", "cites_id": ["14754962158832737230"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017gl072759", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zluOh-gnxMwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
