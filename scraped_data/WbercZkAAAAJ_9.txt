If this ET did not occur temperatures would be higher, so understanding ET trends is crucial to predict future temperatures. Recent studies have reported prolonged declines in ET in recent decades, although these declines may relate to climate variability. Here, we used a well-validated diagnostic model to estimate daily ET during 1981\u20132012 and its three components: transpiration from vegetation (E t), direct evaporation from the soil (E s) and vaporization of intercepted rainfall from vegetation (E i). During this period, ET over land has increased significantly (p< 0.01), caused by increases in E t and E i, which are partially counteracted by E s decreasing. These contrasting trends are primarily driven by increases in vegetation leaf area index, dominated by greening \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 517, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17925311473047905683", "cites_id": ["17925311473047905683"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/srep19124.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kyVB989_w_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 23, "2017": 37, "2018": 61, "2019": 53, "2020": 80, "2021": 96, "2022": 118, "2023": 47}}
