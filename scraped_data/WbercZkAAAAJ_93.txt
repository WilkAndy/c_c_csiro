Methods for estimating photosynthesis (A) vary in their complexity and in which driving processes they capture. Whilst the effect of diffuse shortwave irradiance on A is well understood, few models have explicitly incorporated the diffuse effect into estimates of A. Here we present the DIFFUSE model, a simple, generic, diffuse-light-based method for estimating A at the monthly time scale. This model is based on the assumption that, at the monthly time scale, the majority of variability in A can be explained by the variability in total and diffuse irradiance and in the fraction of shortwave irradiance absorbed by foliage (f). Comparison of model estimates to eddy flux tower-derived monthly A showed that the majority (83%) of variability in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15334880254717858834", "cites_id": ["15334880254717858834"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714003502", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EhScD1hw0NQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 12, "2017": 4, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
