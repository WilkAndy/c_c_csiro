However, to date, in these water stressed regions, the event-based hydrological impact of different land uses induced by re-vegetation activities is not fully understood at the watershed scale. Traditional hillslope plot experiments and paired watershed experiments have proved difficult to up-scale to a watershed level. In 2006 and 2007, we used broad-crested weirs to measure event streamflow from six catchments within the Caijiachuan watershed (area=40.1km2), located in the Loess Plateau, a semi-arid region in China. The six catchments have different land use compositions with functional combinations of crop, grassland, shrubland, secondary forest, and plantations.
