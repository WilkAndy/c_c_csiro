The precise cause(s) of the land\u2010surface stilling remains uncertain and led to this first assessment of how the two most common measurement time intervals of daily mean data averaged wind speed being either: (1) four\u2010synoptic times (0000, 0700, 1300 and 1800 UTC; WS) or (2) 24\u2010h wind run measurements (WR) can affect the estimation of wind speed averages and trends. This was performed across Spain for 1961\u20132011 (12 stations) and 1979\u20132008 (19 stations), where WS and WR daily wind speed observations were simultaneously recorded. Results indicate that mean wind speed is 0.24\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 statistically greater for WS than WR measurements annually, being seasonally dependent with major differences in July (0.49 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17452833608320178557", "cites_id": ["17452833608320178557"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4720", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fVnsm7LrNPIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
