However, the validity of this fundamental assumption has rarely been tested, and the associated uncertainties in water balance calculations remain unknown. Here, we use long\u2010term (1982\u20132011) observations of monthly streamflow (Q) and precipitation (P) for 1,057 global unimpaired catchments, combined with four independent evapotranspiration (E) estimates to infer \u0394S and to provide a global assessment of the steady\u2010state assumption in catchment water balance calculations. Results show that when the threshold for steady state is set to 5% of the mean monthly P, ~70% of the catchments attain steady state within 10 years while ~6% of the catchments fail to reach a steady state even \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3001089545561073105", "cites_id": ["3001089545561073105"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020wr027392", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0WVOjgoDpikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 18, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
