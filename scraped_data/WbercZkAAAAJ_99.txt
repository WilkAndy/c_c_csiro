Despite their importance, the geographic distribution and water use of many important irrigated areas remains uncertain. This paper advances a methodology to map summer cropping irrigated areas experiencing extreme climate and different management practices in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin (Australia). A Random Forest classification model was implemented to austral hemisphere summer irrigated areas for the water-years 2004/05 to 2010/11. The methodology used training samples from Landsat TM/ETM  + reflectance data and monthly time-series of remotely-sensed observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The covariates included in the classification model characterised the monthly dynamics and rates of change of: (i) the vegetation phenology via the recurrent and persistent absorbed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "WbercZkAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13661820642773404590", "cites_id": ["13661820642773404590"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714003137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:roubvX2JmL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
