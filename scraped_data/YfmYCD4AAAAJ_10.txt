Of the 850 isolates typed, 101 EF-1\u03b1, 203 IGS rDNA, and 256 two-locus sequence types (STs) were differentiated. Analysis of the combined dataset suggests that two-thirds of the STs might be associated with a single host plant. This analysis also revealed that the 26 STs associated with human mycoses were genetically diverse, including several which appear to be nosocomial in origin. A congruence analysis, comparing partial EF-1\u03b1 and IGS rDNA bootstrap consensus, identified a significant number of conflicting relationships dispersed throughout the bipartitions, suggesting that some of the IGS rDNA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 352, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9813360861431742443", "cites_id": ["9813360861431742443"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184509001509", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6z9cxrUPMIgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 13, "2011": 14, "2012": 27, "2013": 28, "2014": 18, "2015": 34, "2016": 19, "2017": 30, "2018": 31, "2019": 22, "2020": 39, "2021": 26, "2022": 34, "2023": 12}}
