However, current records from the Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) highlighted several areas with no or very few collections or observations. Brief visits to two of these under-explored remote sites (Orroral Hill and Ginnini Falls) revealed high-quality habitats with interesting species and a potential for new records and species discovery. AVH records also highlighted knowledge gaps for several vascular plant species, which had not been collected nor observed in 30 years. Localisation and abundance information for 18 of these data-deficient vascular plants were provided here, filling in some of the current knowledge gaps. The ranges of six bryophytes and four vascular plants were also extended and, for all of these taxa, these extensions corresponded to new records for the ACT. Location and abundance of nonindigenous species are also discussed here in relation to land management strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://bushblitz.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cryptogams-and-vascular-plants.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:alvDECk67WwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
