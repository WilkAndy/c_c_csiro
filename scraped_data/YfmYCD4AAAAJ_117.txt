P. deminuta should be included in the genus Merismatium (Verrucariales, Verrucariaceae) as M. deminutum. Some of the more orophilous specimens of this fungus (alpine and superior sub-alpine belts) sufficiently differ from the typical specimens (mainly mountain, also supra-Mediterranean) by the spore shape, septation and size. This justifies the description of a new subspecies: Metismatium deminutum subsp. longisporum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15179637212829788318&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
