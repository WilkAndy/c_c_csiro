Results of a pilot project (1996-1998).", "publisher": "RENECOFOR, Office National des Forets, Departement et Developpement Recherches", "abstract": "The methodology and statistical analysis are presented of an inventory of fungi and lichens in France during 1996-98. The minimum number of forays required to arrive at a representative percentage of species (30%) is estimated to be 12 over a 3-year period. The maximum theoretical diversity in the observed areas was estimated as: 10-240 species (Douglas fir stands); 151 species (depleted maritime pine stand); 169 species (Pinus sylvestris stand); 309 species (acidophilic, mountainous beech stand); 322 species (Atlantic Quercus petraea stand) and 613 species (Q. robur in Atlantic environment). Specific diversity and ecology of the species was studied in relation to data on plot characteristics. The fungi reflected the phytosociological association. The idea of the biological spectrum (ratio between number of mycorrhizal species and number of soil based saprotrophic species) was developed as an experimental approach. It was established that this ratio is stable from year to year. Plots were analysed on the basis of regional and national red lists of endangered species. The analysis of sensitive lichen species was consistent with available data on pollution. Special attention was paid to species characteristic of older forests, marked by a long continuity of ecological conditions and the presence of old trees. It is concluded that, even in relatively common forest environments, it is possible to establish a link between the lichen flora and environmental factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023175768", "cites_per_year": {}}
