Since that date, each fungal species can have one nomenclaturally correct name in a particular classification. All other previously used names for this species will be considered as synonyms. The older generic epithet takes priority over the younger name. Any widely used younger names proposed for use, must comply with Art. 57.2 and their usage should be approved by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). In this paper, we list all genera currently accepted by us in Dothideomycetes (belonging to 23 orders and 110 families), including pleomorphic and non-pleomorphic genera. In the case of pleomorphic genera, we follow the rulings of the current ICN and propose single generic names for future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 310, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7962486350619274589", "cites_id": ["7962486350619274589"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13225-014-0309-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xe2OGSZvgG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 11, "2015": 48, "2016": 58, "2017": 49, "2018": 22, "2019": 32, "2020": 33, "2021": 25, "2022": 24, "2023": 6}}
