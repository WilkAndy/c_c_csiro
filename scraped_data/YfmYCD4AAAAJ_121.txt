Remarkably, these metabolites can be detected in herbarium lichen specimens which are preserved years ago. In this research, fresh and preserved lichen specimens from Cladia aggregata (Sw.) Nyl. and Heterodea muelleri (Hampe) Nyl. were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The data analysis was conducted using Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) molecular networking. Four lichen related secondary metabolites network clusters were annotated for citric acid, malonic acid, succinic acid and ursolic acid. The preliminary statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the metabolomic profiles of preserved and fresh lichen specimens. Therefore, it is possible to use preserved collections to screen for potentially bioactive lichen metabolites using GNPS."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jaskaran_Kaur7/publication/365210043_Use_of_known_gene-gene_interactions_in_S-system_based_GRN_inference/links/636b1d032f4bca7fd0451207/Use-of-known-gene-gene-interactions-in-S-system-based-GRN-inference.pdf#page=25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hHhBRoRaiXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
