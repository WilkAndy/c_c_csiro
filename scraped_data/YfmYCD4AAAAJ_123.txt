However, this generic delimitation has been considered artificial by many authors (Serv\u00edt, 1946; Fr\u00f6berg, 1989; Poelt & Hinteregger, 1993; Nimis, 1993, 1998; Halda, 2003). One of the major issues was the use of spore septation to circumscribe genera within this family. For example, the occasional appearance of longitudinal septa in some spores in specimens with otherwise only transverse septa (pauciseptate muriform spores) led to a great deal of confusion in attributing these specimens to a genus. In some cases, spore septation varies within species and is, therefore, also potentially problematic at the generic level. Similarly, thallus structure and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ph/MZfnc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MNt2reIJxKIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
