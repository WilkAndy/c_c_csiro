Voucher specimens were deposited in the Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute Herbarium (TAIE) and are listed in Appendix 1. Genomic DNA from approximately 30 individuals of each species was extracted using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. The methods for microsatellite sequence isolation followed those of Hsu et al.(2009). Genomic DNA from one individual of S. taiwanensis was digested with MseI (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis using a Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer system. DNA fragments between 400 and 1000 bp in length were cut from the gel and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Purified DNA fragments were ligated into adapters (complementary oligo A: 5\u2032-TACTCAGGACTCAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032 phosphorylated oligo: 5\u2032-GACGATGAGTCCTGAG-3\u2032) and amplified by PCR to enrich the partial MseI-digested library using 20 ng template DNA, 10 pmol adapter-specific primers (5\u2032-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAAN-3\u2032), 2 \u03bc L 10\u00d7 reaction buffer, 2 mM dNTP mix, 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Promega), and1 Manuscript received 13 June 2011; revision accepted 2 August 2011.
