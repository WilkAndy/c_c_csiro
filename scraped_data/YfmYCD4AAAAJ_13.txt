Phylogenetic analysis reveals that within the Hypocreales, there are two major clusters containing multiple Acremonium species. One clade contains Acremonium sclerotigenum, the genus Emericellopsis, and the genus Geosmithia as prominent elements. The second clade contains the genera Gliomastix sensu stricto and Bionectria. In addition, there are numerous smaller clades plus two multi-species clades, one containing Acremonium strictum and the type species of the genus Sarocladium, and, as seen in the combined SSU/LSU analysis, one associated subclade containing Acremonium breve and related species plus Acremonium curvulum and related \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 293, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6350024607064474660", "cites_id": ["6350024607064474660"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2011/00000068/00000001/art00009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JEQRe7zRH1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 17, "2013": 16, "2014": 30, "2015": 27, "2016": 32, "2017": 24, "2018": 17, "2019": 33, "2020": 28, "2021": 27, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
