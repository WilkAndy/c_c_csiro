Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of aligned DNA sequences from four loci resolved 28 species within the FIESC, within which the species were evenly divided among two clades designated Incarnatum and Equiseti, and four species within the FCSC. Sequence data from a fifth locus, \u03b2-tubulin, was excluded from the study due to the presence of highly divergent paralogs or xenologs. The multilocus haplotype nomenclature adopted in a previous study (K. O'Donnell, D. A. Sutton, A. Fothergill, D. McCarthy, M. G. Rinaldi, M. E. Brandt, N. Zhang, and D. M. Geiser, J. Clin.
