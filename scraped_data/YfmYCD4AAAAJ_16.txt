In this paper we use phylogenetic analyses based on data available from the Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life project (AFTOL), in addition to sequences in GenBank, to outline this important group of fungi. The Eurotiomycetidae include producers of toxic and useful secondary metabolites, fermentation agents used to make food products and enzymes, xerophiles and psychrophiles, and the important genetics model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 257, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1869789887342539659", "cites_id": ["1869789887342539659"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15572536.2006.11832633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i3Or9_7T8hkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 23, "2010": 12, "2011": 21, "2012": 14, "2013": 17, "2014": 20, "2015": 15, "2016": 20, "2017": 18, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 14, "2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
