Phylogenetic relationships among members of the Verrucariaceae are mostly unknown and the current morphology-based classification has never been confronted to molecular data. A multilocus phylogeny (nuLSU, nuSSU and RPB1) was reconstructed for 83 taxa representing all main genera of this family to provide a molecular phylogenetic framework necessary to assess the current morphology-based classification. Four main well-supported monophyletic groups were recovered, one of which contains seven robust monophyletic subgroups. Most genera, as traditionally delimited, were not monophyletic. A few taxonomic changes are proposed here to reconcile the morphology-based classification with the molecular phylogeny (Endocarpon diffractellum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 214, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13712317213814065680", "cites_id": ["13712317213814065680"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756207001943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EIrc4NrvS74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 18, "2010": 18, "2011": 16, "2012": 18, "2013": 15, "2014": 20, "2015": 16, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
