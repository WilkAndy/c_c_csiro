A specialised, but diverse group of free-living, melanised fungi are amongst the persistent settlers of bare rocks. Multigene phylogenetic analyses were used to study relationships of ascomycetes from a variety of substrates, with a dataset including a broad sampling of rock dwellers from different geographical locations. Rock-inhabiting fungi appear particularly diverse in the early diverging lineages of the orders Chaetothyriales and Verrucariales. Although these orders share a most recent common ancestor, their lifestyles are strikingly different. Verrucariales are mostly lichen-forming fungi, while Chaetothyriales, by contrast, are best known as opportunistic pathogens of vertebrates (e.g. Cladophialophora bantiana and Exophiala \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 204, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17751693012050737052", "cites_id": ["17751693012050737052"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2008/00000061/00000001/art00014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nHcR8b2uWvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 17, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 22, "2015": 18, "2016": 17, "2017": 18, "2018": 12, "2019": 14, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
