Consequently, several genera were recently described or resurrected, and others were re\u2010circumscribed. As an additional step toward this generic revision, three new genera (Hydropunctaria, Parabagliettoa, Wahlenbergiella) and eleven new combinations are proposed here. A summary of the current taxonomic and morphological circumscription of all genera investigated so far is also presented. Several monophyletic groups are identified for which further taxonomical changes will be required, but for which taxon and gene sampling is presently viewed as insufficient. Clear morphological synapomorphies were found to be rare for newly delimited genera \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6762337507329174359", "cites_id": ["6762337507329174359"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tax.581019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V-unbyKm2F0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 10, "2010": 18, "2011": 10, "2012": 13, "2013": 10, "2014": 12, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
