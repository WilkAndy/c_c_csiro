We assembled a six\u2010locus data set including nuclear, mitochondrial and low\u2010copy protein\u2010coding genes from 293 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The lichenicolous lifestyle originated independently three times in lichenized ancestors within Parmeliaceae, and a new generic name is introduced for one of these fungi. In all cases, the independent origins occurred c. 24 million yr ago. Further, we show that the Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene were key periods when diversification of major lineages within Parmeliaceae occurred, with subsequent radiations occurring primarily during the Oligocene and Miocene. Our phylogenetic hypothesis supports the independent origin of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4566047465040326472", "cites_id": ["4566047465040326472"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.13553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SC9NPfrbXT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 15, "2017": 29, "2018": 22, "2019": 18, "2020": 15, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 1}}
