They possess adaptations, which allow them to tolerate extreme abiotic conditions, such as high UV radiations and extreme temperatures. They belong to two separate lineages, one consisting in the sister classes Dothideomycetes and Arthoniomycetes (Dothideomyceta), and the other consisting in the order Chaetothyriales (Eurotiomycetes). Because RIF often form early diverging groups in Chaetothyriales and Dothideomyceta, the ancestors of these two lineages were suggested to most likely be rock-inhabitants. The lineage of RIF related to the Chaetothyriales shows a much narrower phylogenetic spectrum than the lineage of RIF related to Dothideomyceta, suggesting a much more ancient origin for the latter. Our study aims at investigating the times of origin of RIF using a relaxed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15813062375627724885", "cites_id": ["15813062375627724885"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878614611000675", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VZhiDnNIc9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 13, "2017": 17, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
