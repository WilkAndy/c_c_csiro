All had been morphologically identified as Fonsecaea spp. Molecular analyses were based on sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), -tubulin (TUB1) and actin (ACT1) regions. A phylogenetic approach using haplotype networks was used to evaluate species delimitation and genetic diversity. The presence and the modes of reproductive isolation were tested by measuring the index of differentiation (ID) and the index of association (IA). Based on the sequence data, the 39 Fonsecaea strains were classified into three major entities: (i) a group representing Fonsecaea pedrosoi, (ii) a second composed of F. monophora, and (iii) a third group including mostly strains from South America. The two major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11724951111266258005", "cites_id": ["11724951111266258005"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article-abstract/47/1/17/948216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VczYC-pkt6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
