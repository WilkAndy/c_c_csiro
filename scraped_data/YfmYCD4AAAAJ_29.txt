A recent publication by Honsanan et al. in 2020 expanded information of families in Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae with modern classifications. In this paper, we provide a refined updated document on orders and families incertae sedis of Dothideomycetes. Each family is provided with an updated description, notes, including figures to represent the morphology, a list of accepted genera, and economic and ecological significances. We also provide phylogenetic trees for each order. In this study, 31 orders which consist 50 families are assigned as orders incertae sedis in Dothideomycetes, and 41 families are treated as families incertae sedis due to lack of molecular or morphological evidence. The new order, Catinellales, and four new families \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1882787112469169790", "cites_id": ["1882787112469169790"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13225-020-00462-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:foZoQucAIRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 28, "2022": 39, "2023": 15}}
