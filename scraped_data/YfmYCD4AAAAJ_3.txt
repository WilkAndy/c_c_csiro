As part of the project \u201cAssembling the Fungal Tree of Life\u201d (AFTOL), results of four Bayesian analyses are reported with complementary bootstrap assessment of phylogenetic confidence based on (1) a combined two\u2010locus data set (nucSSU and nucLSU rDNA) with 558 species representing all traditionally recognized fungal phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota) and the Glomeromycota, (2) a combined three\u2010locus data set (nucSSU, nucLSU, and mitSSU rDNA) with 236 species, (3) a combined three\u2010locus data set (nucSSU, nucLSU rDNA, and RPB2) with 157 species, and (4) a combined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 890, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6949047788788177150", "cites_id": ["6949047788788177150"], "pub_url": "https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.91.10.1446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_tjucSX6b2AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 21, "2006": 62, "2007": 63, "2008": 58, "2009": 56, "2010": 52, "2011": 55, "2012": 63, "2013": 56, "2014": 58, "2015": 46, "2016": 34, "2017": 56, "2018": 35, "2019": 40, "2020": 37, "2021": 32, "2022": 30, "2023": 18}}
