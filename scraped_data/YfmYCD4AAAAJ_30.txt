Although both intrinsic innovations and extrinsic ecological opportunities contribute to diversification bursts, few studies have looked at the synergistic effect of such factors. Here we investigate the Teloschistales (Ascomycota), a group of >1,000 lichenized species with variation in species richness and phenotypic traits that hinted at a potential adaptive radiation. We found evidence for a dramatic increase in diversification rate for one of four families within this order\u2014Teloschistaceae\u2014which occurred \u223c100 Mya (Late Cretaceous) and was associated with a switch from bark to rock and from shady to sun-exposed habitats. This adaptation to sunny habitats is likely to have been enabled by a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11684112668053484543", "cites_id": ["11684112668053484543"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1507072112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_zP4BpFOJqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 14, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 20, "2023": 7}}
