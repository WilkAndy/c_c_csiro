Recent contributions from molecular studies have changed our understanding of the composition of this subclass. Among others, ant-associated fungi, deep-sea fungi and bryophilous fungi were also shown to belong to this group of ascomycetes. The delimitation of orders and families within this subclass has not previously been re-assessed using a broad phylogenetic study and the phylogenetic position of some taxa such as the lichenised family Celotheliaceae or the Chaetothyrialean bryophilous fungi is still unclear. In our study, we assemble new and published sequences from 132 taxa and reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using four markers (nuLSU, nuSSU, mtSSU and RPB1).
