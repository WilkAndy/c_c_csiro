The MCF strain A95 Knufia petricola (syn. Sarcinomyces petricola) belongs to an ancestral lineage of the order Chaetothyriales (class Eurotiomycetes). K. petricola strain A95 is a rock-inhabiting MCF and its growth requirements were studied using the 96-well plate-based Biolog\u2122 System under \u223c1070 different conditions (osmotic stress, pH growth optima, growth factor requirements and nutrient catabolism). A95 is an osmotolerant, oligotrophic MCF that grows best around pH 5. Remarkably, A95 shows metabolic activity in the absence of added nitrogen, phosphorus or sulphur. Correlations could be drawn between the known nutrient requirements of A95 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7353779278864990974", "cites_id": ["7353779278864990974"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184513000650", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_kJgyUrfDWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
