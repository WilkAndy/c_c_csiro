Based on a nucSSU, nucLSU and mtSSU multi-locus phylogeny, seven of them were found to cluster into a distinct and well-supported clade in a basal position within the Class Dothideomycetes. As in other rock fungi these new groups of isolates were characterized by a meristematic growth and a scarcely differentiated morphology with highly melanized and thick-walled toruloid hyphae. Nonetheless, few peculiar characters were also observed as convoluted hyphal tips and the production of spherical propagules. The new genus and species Saxomyces alpinus and S. penninicus, are here described based on morphological and molecular data, in a yet to be defined order of the Dothideomycetes. The remaining two black fungi clustered in Cryomyces, a genus previously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14893435674360602736", "cites_id": ["14893435674360602736"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13225-013-0234-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cOBkR9YcsM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
