Here we construct a detailed genus\u2010level phylogeny of the family. We confirm previous morphology\u2010based findings suggesting that a substantial proportion of genera are not monophyletic, and that an overemphasis has been placed on certain character state combinations which do not strictly reflect phylogenetic relationships. Specifically, patterns of ascospore septation, ostiole orientation and type of ascomatal aggregation are evolutionarily labile, and of limited utility for the delimitation of genera as currently circumscribed. We show that species from a number of genera including Astrothelium, Bathelium, Cryptothelium, Laurera and Trypethelium together form a strongly supported group, referred to here as the \u201cAstrothelium\u201d clade.
