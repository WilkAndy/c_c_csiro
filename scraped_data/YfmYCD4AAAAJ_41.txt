In addition to being the causative agent of some superficial infections, FSSC has recently emerged as a group of common opportunistic moulds, mainly in patients with haematological malignancies. Molecular typing methods are essential in order to better understand the epidemiology of such opportunistic agents with the final goal of preventing contamination. A three-locus typing scheme has thus been developed for FSSC; based on polymorphisms in the domains of the ITS, EF-1 alpha, and RPB2 genes. This method is now considered to be a useful reference for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies. In other significant clinical fungi (e.g., Candida sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus), genes coding for metabolic enzymes have been widely used and proven to be very informative for diagnosis and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6537161364637064892", "cites_id": ["6537161364637064892"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701210002393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vJ6ZMqCpuFoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
