Some members occur in humid habitats; however some evolved unusually delicate thallus morphologies, such as minute shell-like disks, microfilamentous cushions or brittle flakes. In this study we aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic placement of such morphologically outstanding taxa. We included in our analyses Agonimia spp., Flakea papillata, Normandina spp. and Psoroglaena spp. and used a multilocus sequence dataset of the Verrucariales (SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, mtSSU, RPB1). The resulting hypothesis revealed genus Normandina as a monophyletic group. Lauderlindsaya was confirmed as a synonym of Normandina. Normandina acroglypta is nested in N. pulchella. Psoroglaena abscondita does not cluster with other species of this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15266971817634520125", "cites_id": ["15266971817634520125"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3852/09-153", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PVwB8vot39MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
