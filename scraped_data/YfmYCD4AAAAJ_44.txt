Using a phylogenetic approach based on seven molecular markers, we showed that ant-associated Chaetothyriales are scattered through the phylogeny of this order. There was no clustering according to geographical origin or to the taxonomy of the ant host. However, strains tended to be clustered according to the type of association with ants: strains from ant-made carton and strains from plant cavities occupied by ants (\u2018domatia\u2019) rarely clustered together. Defining molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) with an internal transcribed spacer sequence similarity cut-off of 99% revealed that a single MOTU could be composed of strains collected from various ant species and from several continents. Some ant-associated MOTUs also contained strains \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16913572343327931755", "cites_id": ["16913572343327931755"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2016.2519", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a73uLm8UueoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 7}}
