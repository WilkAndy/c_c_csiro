The most important of these opportunists is the neurotropic species Ochroconis gallopava, which occurs in birds and occasionally in immunocompromised humans. Other Ochroconis species have been isolated from superficial infections of cats, dogs and fish. In their natural environment, these species are found in litter, soil, and on moist surfaces. Some thermophilic species have been isolated from hot springs, industrial effluents, and self-heated plant material. Although their ecology and epidemiology has been investigated, their classification within the ascomycetes is still unknown. Here, the phylogenetic placement of Ochroconis is investigated using a four-gene phylogeny (nuLSU, nuSSU, mtSSU and RPB2). The results show that Ochroconis and its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5718684296618147818", "cites_id": ["5718684296618147818"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13225-013-0252-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6n-HohHZXE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
