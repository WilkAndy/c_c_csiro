These mostly lichenised ascomycete fungi are relatively well known, as identification tools are available for many members of the family, including the most species-rich genus Pyrenula. However, despite the past boom in DNA sequence generation for most living organisms, molecular data are still mainly lacking for these crustose corticolous lichens, mainly because genomic DNA does not seem to preserve well after specimen desiccation. Because of lengthy customs procedures, newly collected specimens are therefore often too old for molecular work when they reach the laboratory. Here, a new method of DNA extraction and storage using FTA card samples was investigated. New DNA sequences were generated using both DNA extractions from freshly collected material (116 sequences) and FTA card samples (115 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9748770807855889978", "cites_id": ["9748770807855889978"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11557-015-1154-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Or7yBmaXSocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
