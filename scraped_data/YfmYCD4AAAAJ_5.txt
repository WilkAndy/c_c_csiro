Many species are saprobes, with many asexual states comprising important plant pathogens. They are also endophytes, epiphytes, fungicolous, lichenized, or lichenicolous fungi. They occur in terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats in almost every part of the world. We accept 105 families in Dothideomycetes with the new families Anteagloniaceae, Bambusicolaceae, Biatriosporaceae, Lichenoconiaceae, Muyocopronaceae, Paranectriellaceae, Roussoellaceae, Salsugineaceae, Seynesiopeltidaceae and Thyridariaceae introduced in this paper. Each family is provided with a description and notes, including asexual and asexual states, and if more than one genus is included, the type genus is also characterized. Each family is provided with at least \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 669, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2991690530346348349,11881359288303593321", "cites_id": ["2991690530346348349", "11881359288303593321"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/211a9758a415906922b47bfb02058305/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2034543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pa8xy6-ehCkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 64, "2015": 71, "2016": 77, "2017": 69, "2018": 60, "2019": 66, "2020": 82, "2021": 87, "2022": 63, "2023": 21}}
