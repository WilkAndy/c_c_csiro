In many cases, what had once been understood as traditional species were found to be species complexes. Importantly, members of such complexes may differ in pathogenicity and susceptibility to antifungals, which suggests a need for accurate identification to provide optimal patient care. This article presents a few striking examples from Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycetes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7478194388672347390", "cites_id": ["7478194388672347390"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12281-009-0022-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_nwi4izix2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
