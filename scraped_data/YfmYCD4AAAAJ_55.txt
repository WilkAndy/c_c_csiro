This marine ascomycete has so far been found only on the coast of Central California, although its photobiont has a much broader geographical distribution. Morphological and ecological characters have led a previous author to attribute this marine fungus to Verrucaria, a genus including other species colonizing the intertidal zone of rocky seashores. Phylogenetic inferences from two nuclear and one mitochondrial loci confirm the placement of Verrucaria tavaresiae within the lichen family Verrucariaceae and more specifically within the marine genus Wahlenbergiella. The new combination Wahlenbergiella tavaresiae (R. L. Moe) Gueidan, Th\u00fcs & P\u00e9rez-Ortega is therefore proposed here."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17942851359737377227", "cites_id": ["17942851359737377227"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/41289813", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y_HHEj_QAfkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
