Our field study in the karst system of northern Vietnam showed that it is also common on dry to humid limestone in the wet tropics. Molecular data revealed that species of Staurothele from Vietnam belong to an unnamed clade sister to the genus Endocarpon, together with the tropical Australian species Staurothele pallidopora and Staurothele diffractella, a North American species recently transferred to Endocarpon based on molecular data. The genus Willeya is here resurrected for this clade of crustose epilithic Staurothele with pale ascospores. Eight new combinations are proposed and three new species of Willeya are described from Vietnam.
