For the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), three gene regions have been widely used to investigate phylogenetic relationships at the interspecific level (ITS-nuLSU, EF1a, RPB2) and a nomenclature system has been proposed for the different known haplotypes. More recently, a MLST scheme was proposed for this species complex based on the polymorphisms of five housekeeping genes (ACC, ICL, GDP, MDP, SOD). Here, we compare the phylogenetic resolution and sequence discriminatory powers of these two sets of loci on 50 epidemiologically unrelated FSSC strains. Although the widely used gene set offers better phylogenetic resolution, the newly developed gene set is slightly better at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8735877955202868263", "cites_id": ["8735877955202868263"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701212002382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J2QIMbcSPHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
