In the tropics its natural habitat is thought to be fruit surfaces and it is also found in the digestive system of fruit-eating animals. However, it has recently been abundantly isolated from human-made environments (steam baths, railway ties, dishwashers) in tropical and temperate climates. Two genotypes have been distinguished within this species: genotype A, mostly corresponding to strains isolated from patients, and genotype B, to strains isolated from the natural environment. In human-made environments, both genotypes A and B occur. A previous study suggested that one genotype had been selected for in the human host. In our study, the distribution of ribosomal insertions agrees with an ecological specialization of E. dermatitidis genotypes by showing a significantly higher frequency of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10269253493446143525", "cites_id": ["10269253493446143525"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878614611000766", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Je5LuaS3g44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
