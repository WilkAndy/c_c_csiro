In this study, the traditional morphology\u2010based species and genus delimitations were tested using the phylogenetic markers ITS, mcm7 and mtSSU. Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches were used on a dataset of 82 specimens to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between the eight most common species of Bagliettoa. Molecular data confirmed the placement of B. limborioides, the type of the generic name, within the clade including species usually considered as part of Bagliettoa. Five other species were monophyletic and well supported (B. baldensis, B. calciseda, B. cazzae, B. marmorea, B. parmigerella).
