Massal. is a genus of lichenized fungi belonging to Verrucariaceae (Ascomycota). Traditional classification heavily rested on a few cardinal characters, primarily ascoma structure and spore morphology, but the delimitation of Polyblastia was problematic. Using DNA sequences from nucLSU, and RPB1 the position of the \u2018Polyblastia group\u2019, as a strongly supported clade within Verrucariaceae, was confirmed. A three marker phylogeny (including nucITS) based on a wide taxon sampling reveals strongly supported clades within the \u2018Polyblastia group\u2019. Thus Polyblastia s. str. is recognized. The phylogeny of the strongly supported Thelidium clade is not completely resolved. In a different clade, Verrucaria rupestris, the type of Verrucaria, is a sister to the Henrica melaspora/H. theleodes clade. Trimmatothele perquisita, the type of Trimmatothele, forms a strongly supported group with a Verrucaria species. The genus Sporodictyon, until recently included in Polyblastia, is resurrected.Species delimitation in Sporodictyon is investigated, and the morphological variation within and between the monophyletic groups is evaluated in an effort to reconcile morphological and molecular data. A taxonomic revision of Sporodictyon, occurring in Northern Europe and the adjacent Arctic is provided, and two new species are described. A comprehensive material is investigated, a key to the species is provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=583035450452815271", "cites_id": ["583035450452815271"], "pub_url": "https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:171081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:py2zM6dbFwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
