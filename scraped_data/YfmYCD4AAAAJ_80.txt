Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of aligned DNA 4 sequences from four loci resolved 28 species within the FIESC, within which the species 5 were evenly divided among two clades designated Incarnatum and Equiseti, and four 6 species within the FCSC. Sequence data from a fifth locus, \u03b2-tubulin, was excluded from 7 the study due to the presence of highly divergent paralogs or xenologs. The multilocus 8 haplotype nomenclature adopted in a previous study (K. O\u2019Donnell, DA Sutton, A. 9 Fothergill, D. McCarthy, MG Rinaldi, ME Brandt, N. Zhang, and DM Geiser, J. 10 Clin.
