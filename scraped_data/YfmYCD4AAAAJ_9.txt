Therefore, the need for accurate DNA sequence data, tied to both correct taxonomic names and clearly annotated specimen data, has never been greater. Furthermore, the growing number of molecular ecology and microbiome projects using high-throughput sequencing require fast and effective methods for en masse species assignments. In this article, we focus on selecting and re-annotating a set of marker reference sequences that represent each currently accepted order of Fungi. The particular focus is on sequences from the internal transcribed spacer region in the nuclear ribosomal cistron, derived from type specimens and/or ex-type cultures. Re-annotated and verified sequences were deposited in a curated public database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 355, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3988253842249147641", "cites_id": ["3988253842249147641"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/database/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/database/bau061/2634542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-eRYJb0fWTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 13, "2015": 36, "2016": 48, "2017": 38, "2018": 33, "2019": 27, "2020": 39, "2021": 58, "2022": 42, "2023": 20}}
