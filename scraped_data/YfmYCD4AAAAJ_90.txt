Alghero, Sardinia (Italy), August 30th\u2013September 2nd", "abstract": "An electronically portable two-locus DNA sequence database, comprising partial sequences of the translation elongation factor gene (EF-1a, 634 bp alignment) and nearly complete sequences of the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer region (IGS rDNA, 2220 bp alignment) for 850 isolates spanning the phylogenetic breadth of the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC), was constructed to investigate evolutionary relationships and provide discrete nucleotide sequence-based markers for identifying host-specific pathogens (ie, formae speciales), putative non-pathogens, and opportunistic pathogens of humans and other animals within the FOSC. Of the 850 isolates subjected to the DNA-sequence based typing scheme, 101 EF-1a, 204 IGS rDNA, and 257 two-locus sequence types (STs) were differentiated. One hundred and forty of the two locus STs were singletons. The human mycoses-associated isolates were widely distributed throughout the FOSC phylogeny and represent at least 25 putatively clonal lineages. Several of these lineages are exclusively associated with mycotic infections, whereas others include isolates from hospital or industrial plumbing systems. Mycotoxin analyses of twenty isolates representing the phylogenetic breadth of the FOSC indicate that moniliformin (MON) and fumonisin (FUM) production may be very limited in that only one strain produced MON and one FUM. This data will be incorporated into the next version of the web-accessible Fusarium-ID database."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10242405624402358304", "cites_id": ["10242405624402358304"], "pub_url": "https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=225487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IDD3F6ZVJI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2}}
