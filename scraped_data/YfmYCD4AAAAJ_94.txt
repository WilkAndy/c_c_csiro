In Burgundy, the authors have nevertheless begun to study the accumulation of other metals and trace-elements; They have been monitored in potentially contaminated sites and in many rural areas for comparisons. As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mg, Ni, Pb, and Zn have been monitored since 1992 in the Saone-et-Loire Department; this environmental follow-up was recently completed with analyses of lichen samples from 45 sites in 1998 and 60 other sites in 1999. When the industrial environment seemed to justify it, other elements were also looked for, such as Ag, Sn, and V. The lichens involved were mainly Parmelia sulcata, but also Xanthoria parietina, X. polycarpa and a few other species. A statistical treatment has been done for some of the elements in P. sulcata and X. parietina. The regional backgroud for each element was estimated and it appeared that for several elements (Ag, Cr, Ni, Pb...) the highest values near sensitive sites exceeded this background by two orders of magnitude. For others such as Cd or As, the differences were usually only of one order of magnitude. The results are now numerous enough to envisage the use of lichens as a real tool kit to monitor and follow up the presence of heavy metals and other trace elements in the environment: 1) The ratio between different elements can be used to follow evolutions; 2) The biological period of some elements in lichens can be estimated more accurately; 3) In some cases (Pb), we have noted that in sites with lead problems in humans (more than 100 pg Pb per litre \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=369378916543780634", "cites_id": ["369378916543780634"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20332474#page=124", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Glcc5CpMIAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
