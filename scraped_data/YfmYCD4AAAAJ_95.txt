For lichenized eukaryotic algae, genome sequencing has focused mostly on Trebouxia and Asterochloris, with little genomic data available for Stichococcus-like algae, such as Diplosphaera. The genus Diplosphaera is a common component of biological soil crusts, and often occurs associated with lichens of the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by cylindrical to spherical cells containing a plate-like chloroplast, and more specifically by a vegetative cell division that leads to the formation of typical two- to four-celled clusters. Here, we present a draft genome sequence for the algal partner of an Australian lichen specimen of Endocarpon pusillum. The genome was sequenced with Pac Bio long read and Illumina short read technologies, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "YfmYCD4AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09670262.2023.2165711", "cites_per_year": {}}
