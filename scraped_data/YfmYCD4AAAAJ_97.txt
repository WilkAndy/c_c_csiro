These metabolites could be used to develop natural product-based therapeutics. To screen for these metabolites, insects must be collected and accurately identified. Natural history collections consist of identified insects and provide a source of raw material for metabolomic screening. The objective of this research was to understand whether preservation significantly altered the insect metabolomic profiles. Insects from the family Sphecidae: Podalonia tydei (Le Guillou), which were preserved in ethanol, flash frozen, and homogenized with methanol. The resulting metabolomic extracts and storage ethanol were analysed using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mass spectral data were processed with MZmine2. The data were analysed using multivariate statistical analysis.
