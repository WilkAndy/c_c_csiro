Species that live in dense populations, large social groups, or with promiscuous mating systems may be especially vulnerable to infectious diseases owing to the close proximity and higher contact rates among individuals. We review the effects of host density and social contacts on parasite spread and the importance of promiscuity and mating structure for the spread and evolution of sexually transmitted diseases. Host social organization and mating system should influence not only parasite diversity and prevalence but may also determine the fitness advantages of different transmission strategies to parasites. Because host behavior and immune defenses may have evolved to reduce the spread and pathogenicity of infectious diseases, we also consider selective pressures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 857, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=763145725846860222", "cites_id": ["763145725846860222"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.030102.151725", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vrH1jP48lwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 19, "2006": 21, "2007": 28, "2008": 28, "2009": 42, "2010": 32, "2011": 39, "2012": 52, "2013": 55, "2014": 53, "2015": 66, "2016": 60, "2017": 76, "2018": 60, "2019": 52, "2020": 59, "2021": 56, "2022": 40, "2023": 10}}
