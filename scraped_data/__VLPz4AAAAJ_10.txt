Plant host\u2010pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article, we focus on long\u2010term studies of several natural host\u2010pathogen interactions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic patterns at local and regional scales. Specifically, we examine the degree of among\u2010population asynchrony in disease presence/absence and abundance, and the extent to which this is a function of isolation.
