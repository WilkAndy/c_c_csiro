Pollen limitation and loss of self-incompatibility genotypes can both act independently to reduce seed set and these effects are commonly observed in fragmented landscapes. This study used a simulation modelling approach to assess the interacting effects of these two processes on plant reproductive performance and population viability for a range of pollination likelihood, self-incompatibility systems and S-allele richness conditions.A spatially explicit, individual-based, genetic and demographic simulation model parameterized to represent a generic self-incompatible, short-lived perennial herb was used to conduct simulation experiments in which pollination probability, self-incompatibility type (gametophytic and sporophytic) and S \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15958675258126931574", "cites_id": ["15958675258126931574"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/109/3/643/130368", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dpZ4NpiaeN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
