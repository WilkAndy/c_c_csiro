Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates, transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait (including possibly negative benefits), and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13625548818559544263", "cites_id": ["13625548818559544263"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209001286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xyv8j3WsF70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
