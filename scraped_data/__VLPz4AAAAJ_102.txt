For orchids, association with a suitable mycorrhizal fungus is vital for successful germination, growth and establishment. Using an evolutionarily distinct group of Australasian terrestrial orchids, the Pterostylidinae (Cranichiadeae: Orchidaceae), we assessed potential codiversification and the level of response between this diverse host group (~250 species) and their associated fungal symbionts. All fungal isolates recovered (~200 from 41 host species covering all major orchid clades) were identified as species of Ceratobasidium, which clustered into strongly supported groups using nuclear (ITS) and mitochondrial (ML 4\u20135) gene sequences. Three clades within the Pterostylidinae phylogeny showed associations with specific fungal clades.
