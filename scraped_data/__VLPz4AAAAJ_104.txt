Variability in pathogen growth rates and spore production in vitro, as well as disease severity and lesion growth rate on C. maritima in glasshouse inoculation trials, were investigated. Substantial variation was found in growth rates among individual A. brassicicola isolates, as well as among pathogen populations. A significant trade\u2010off also existed between growth and spore production, such that faster\u2010growing isolates produced fewer spores per unit area. While there was little evidence for a link between growth in vitro and either disease severity or lesion development among fast\u2010 vs slow\u2010growth isolate classes at the individual isolate level, the results suggest that variation in pathogen fitness components associated with aggressiveness may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6711171624054983321", "cites_id": ["6711171624054983321"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2005.01190.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mYp65gjfIl0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
