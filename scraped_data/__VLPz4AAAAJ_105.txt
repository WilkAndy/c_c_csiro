Various deployment strategies have been proposed to improve resistance management. Globally, these rely on careful selection of resistance sources and their combination at various spatiotemporal scales (e.g., via gene pyramiding, crop rotations and mixtures, landscape mosaics). However, testing and optimizing these strategies using controlled experiments at large spatiotemporal scales are logistically challenging. Mathematical models provide an alternative investigative tool, and many have been developed to explore resistance deployment strategies under various contexts. This review analyzes 69 modeling studies in light of specific model structures (e.g., demographic or demogenetic, spatial or not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4251115167177168021", "cites_id": ["4251115167177168021"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-phyto-020620-122134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ldTenrj-_joJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 10, "2022": 20, "2023": 12}}
