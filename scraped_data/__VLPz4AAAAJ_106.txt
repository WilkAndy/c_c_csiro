In particular, many landscape\u2010based strategies rely on the deployment of resistant and susceptible cultivars in an agricultural landscape as a mosaic. However, the design of such strategies is not easy as strategies targeting epidemiological or evolutionary outcomes may not be the same. Using a stochastic spatially explicit model, we studied the impact of landscape organization (as defined by the proportion of fields cultivated with a resistant cultivar and their spatial aggregation) and key pathogen life\u2010history traits on three measures of disease control. Our results show that short\u2010term epidemiological dynamics are optimized when landscapes are planted with a high proportion of the resistant cultivar in low aggregation. Importantly, the exact opposite situation is optimal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8909567922779917332", "cites_id": ["8909567922779917332"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FAyDI9IkpXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
