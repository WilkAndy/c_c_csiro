Sharing of resources \u2013 such as shared waterholes during a dry season \u2013 may provide an efficient route for the transmission of infectious agents among different social groups, and thus could represent an overlooked factor in understanding disease risks in spatially structured populations. We developed a spatially explicit individual-based model to investigate a situation in which multiple individuals of a single species converge at shared resources during periods of resource scarcity (i.e., \u201clean seasons\u201d). We simulated the transmission of a fecally transmitted infectious agent in a spatially explicit meta-population of 81 social groups distributed on a square lattice. Time steps in the simulation corresponded to \u201cdays,\u201d and we simulated disease dynamics over 10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6510869491531692060", "cites_id": ["6510869491531692060"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013004663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HLisdU5BW1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
