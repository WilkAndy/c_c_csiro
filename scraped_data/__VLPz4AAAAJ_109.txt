Due to anthropogenic activity, average air temperatures are expected to increase by a few degrees in coming decades, accompanied by an increased occurrence of extreme temperature events. Such global trends are likely to have various major impacts on human society through their influence on natural ecosystems, food production and biotic interactions, including diseases. In this study, we used a combination of statistical genetics, experimental evolution and common garden experiments to investigate the evolutionary potential for thermal adaptation in the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, and infer its likely response to changing temperatures. We found a trade\u2010off associated with thermal adaptation to heterogeneous environments in P. infestans, with the degree of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9401679954645721142", "cites_id": ["9401679954645721142"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13727", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NqCRRBt6eYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
