We report on work over an 18\u2010month period involving multiple beach populations of the plant Cakile maritima and its fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola along the south\u2010east coast of Australia.  2 Results from permanent transects replicated on several beaches show that disease incidence and prevalence vary significantly with plant age, class and distance from the sea, as well as time during the season. Plant density is also positively related to disease levels.  3 Results from three subregions indicate that disease persistence depends on survival of infected plants behind the foredunes of protected beaches. Population extinction was more likely on beaches with greater wind exposure and sea access, with the latter also related to colonization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8578842816944289515", "cites_id": ["8578842816944289515"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0022-0477.2001.00598.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6zbg3xYsDncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
