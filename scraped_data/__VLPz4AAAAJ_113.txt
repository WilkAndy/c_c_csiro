In this study, this system was used in an experimental metapopulation approach to investigate explicitly how the distance (degree of isolation) between local population patches influences disease dynamics within a growing season, as well as the genetic structure of pathogen populations through stochastic colonization and extinction processes. The experimental design centred on four replicate sets of populations, within which patches were spaced at increasingly greater distances apart. Each patch consisted of an identical set of host and pathogen genotypes, with each pathogen genotype having the ability to attack only one of four host\u2010resistance types.
