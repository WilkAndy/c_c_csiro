Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of variation in the genetic composition and function of rhizobial communities is critical to understanding rhizobial impacts on community and ecosystem productivity. In this study, we examined how environmental factors and host species jointly affect rhizobial phenotypic diversity and community structure. Individual host plants of two native Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and A. stenophylla, were inoculated with a community of six rhizobial strains (belonging to three genera) previously characterized for symbiotic effectiveness. The plants were grown in a fully factorial experiment under high and low phosphorus and water, and high or no nitrogen. Half the plants were harvested after 19 weeks and the other half after 30 weeks.
