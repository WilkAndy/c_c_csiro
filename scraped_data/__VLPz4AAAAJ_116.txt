An experiment was conducted to contrast the responses to Aporrectodea trapezoides introduction between soils from sites with established (Talmo, 64 A. trapezoides m\u22122) and rare (Glenrock, 0.6 A. trapezoides m\u22122) A. trapezoides populations. Our hypothesis was that earthworm introduction would lead to similar changes in bacterial communities in both soils. The effects of earthworm introduction (earthworm activity and cadaver decomposition) did not lead to a convergence of bacterial community composition between the two soils. However, in both soils, the Firmicutes decreased in abundance and a common set of bacteria responded positively to earthworms. The increase in the abundance of Flavobacterium, Chitinophagaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2851593520457378451", "cites_id": ["2851593520457378451"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/94/5/fiy051/4951599", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k-qqzjLlkicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
