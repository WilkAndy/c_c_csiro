Recent results confirm the importance of negative frequency-dependent rather than \u2018arms-race\u2019 processes in the evolution of individual host\u2013pathogen associations. At the community level, complex relationships between species abundance and diversity dampen or alter pathogen impacts. Invasive pathogens challenge these controls reflecting the earliest stages of evolutionary associations (akin to arms-race) where disease effects may be so great that they overwhelm the host's and community's ability to respond. Viewing these different stabilization/destabilization phases as a continuum provides a valuable perspective to assessment of the role of genetics and ecology in the dynamics of both natural and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4948401015026221565", "cites_id": ["4948401015026221565"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526613000642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_QHSYoFArEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
