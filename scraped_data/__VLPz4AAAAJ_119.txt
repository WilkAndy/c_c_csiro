Correlated-divergence analysis (using phylogenetically independent contrasts) and cross-species analysis (exploring patterns across present-day species) were employed in a complementary fashion to test the hypothesis that rare and common species differed with respect to life history. Two measures of rarity, threat of extinction and geographical range size, were investigated for relationships with growth form, longevity, pollination mode, mating system, dispersal and seed mass. Species threatened with extinction had, on average, significantly smaller seed mass than non-threatened species. This emerged in both correlated-divergence and cross-species analyses, independently of the effects of the other life-history traits. In cross-species analysis, but not as phylogenetic contrasts, a significant number of species with short life spans \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4227949086548056145", "cites_id": ["4227949086548056145"], "pub_url": "https://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v04/1407.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UVgiKEuxrDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
