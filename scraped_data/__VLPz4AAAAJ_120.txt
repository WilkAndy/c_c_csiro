Biogeochemical cycles are disrupted in agricultural-systems, providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the roles of management and land-use in shaping microbial communities and ecosystem function. We investigated soil ammonia oxidisers under different cropping practices and within a nearby grassy woodland; representing a gradient of physical/chemical disturbance. Land-use and management practices resulted in significant differences in community structure. Major differences in system connectivity were observed between land-uses, but not within management practices, indicating that land-use change is the major driver of ecosystem change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13477839636531347258", "cites_id": ["13477839636531347258"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071714002600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:On8ho73nCrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
