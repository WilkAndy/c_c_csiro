However, effective use of soil microbes in revegetation requires knowledge of how microbe communities vary along environmental stress gradients, as well as how such variation relates to symbiont effectiveness. In Australia, shrubby legumes dominate many ecosystems where dryland salinity is a major issue, and improving plant establishment in saline soils is a priority of regional management agencies. In this study, strains of rhizobial bacteria were isolated from a range of Acacia spp. growing in saline and non\u2010saline soils. Replicates of each strain were grown under several salinity levels in liquid culture and characterized for growth and salt tolerance.
