Patterns of partial resistance showed clear evidence of gene\u2010for\u2010gene interactions, with particular levels of partial resistance occurring in specific host\u2013pathogen combinations. Sympatric and putatively more highly coevolved host\u2013pathogen combinations had a lower frequency of partial resistance types relative to allopatric combinations. Sympatric host\u2013pathogen combinations also showed a lower diversity of resistance responses, but there was a trend toward a greater fraction of this variance being determined by pathogen\u2010genotype \u00d7 host\u2010genotype interactions. In this system, there was no evidence that partial resistances slow host\u2013pathogen coevolution.
