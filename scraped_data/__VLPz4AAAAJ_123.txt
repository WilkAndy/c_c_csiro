This response may result from targeting inappropriate host life stages, failure of the control agent to establish and proliferate because of poor matching of host and pathogen life histories, or from broad environmental mismatching. At a genetic level, interactions between host and pathogen may determine the ultimate success of control programs. Here, we use a simulation model to illustrate that the optimal level of pathogen virulence is influenced by factors such as host longevity, as well as whether pathogen impacts on targets are through reduced fecundity or increased mortality. Importantly, the optimal pathogen in terms of effective long-term control of a target population is not necessarily the most virulent strain. In part, this is because the imposition of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11324675273374479150", "cites_id": ["11324675273374479150"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3989632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LrMiEilUKZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
