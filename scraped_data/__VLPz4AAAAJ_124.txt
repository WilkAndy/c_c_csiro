In a large cross\u2010inoculation experiment we surveyed patterns of host resistance and pathogen infectivity in anther\u2010smut diseased Viscaria alpina populations from three contrasting areas where populations range from continuous, through patchy but spatially connected to highly isolated demes. In agreement with theory, isolated populations of V. alpina were more susceptible on average than either patchily distributed or continuous populations. While increased dispersal in connected systems increases disease spread, it may also increase host gene flow and the potential for greater host resistance to evolve. In the Viscaria\u2013Microbotryum system, pathogen infectivity mirrored patterns of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2729953744375503484", "cites_id": ["2729953744375503484"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article-abstract/69/4/926/6852449", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fNq_cne-4iUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
