This presents a challenge for predicting when\u2014and where\u2014pathogen evolution may occur. While gene flow and spatially heterogeneous environments are recognized to be critical for the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations, we lack an understanding of how the two jointly shape coevolutionary trajectories between hosts and pathogens. The rust pathogen Melampsora lini infects two ecotypes of its host plant Linum marginale that occur in close proximity yet in distinct populations and habitats. In this study, we found that within-population epidemics were different between the two habitats. We then tested for pathogen local adaptation at host population and ecotype level in a reciprocal inoculation study. Even after controlling for the effect of spatial structure on infection outcome, we found strong evidence of pathogen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15015072158818248975", "cites_id": ["15015072158818248975"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2014.0522", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Dyk4P5NAYNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
