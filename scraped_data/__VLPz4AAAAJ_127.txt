Thus, a critical challenge in plant pathology and epidemiology is to design durable and effective strategies to protect cropping systems from damage caused by pathogens. Theoretical studies suggest that spatio\u2010temporal variation in the diversity and distribution of resistant hosts across agricultural landscapes may have strong effects on the epidemiology and evolutionary potential of crop pathogens. However, we lack empirical tests of spatio\u2010temporal deployment of host resistance to pathogens can be best used to manage disease epidemics and disrupt pathogen evolutionary dynamics in real\u2010world systems. In a field experiment, we simulated how differences in Brassica napus resistance deployment strategies and landscape connectivity influence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6374913444873097297", "cites_id": ["6374913444873097297"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12630", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UdCFmwA-eFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
