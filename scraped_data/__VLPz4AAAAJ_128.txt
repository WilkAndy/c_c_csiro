The species is threatened by combined ecological and genetic factors, e.g. land conversion, weed invasion, low recruitment and low gene flow among populations. The populations also show large variance in male fitness and limited mate availability which are thought to arise as a consequence of gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI). This study has used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to explore the interaction between GSI and mate limitation in this species, as well as its effect on long-term population viability. The model was parameterised with demographic and genetic data obtained from 2 years of population monitoring. Simulation results identified extremely low establishment rates as the most critical factor currently influencing the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=713832526782975720", "cites_id": ["713832526782975720"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-007-9366-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6M4ErOYK6AkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
