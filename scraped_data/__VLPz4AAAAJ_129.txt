We analysed the diversity of putative nitrogen\u2010fixing bacteria (NFB, i.e. nifH gene present) associated with five invasive legumes, four Acacia spp. and a sister taxon Paraserianthes lophantha in introduced and native range populations in Australia. We predicted that, because these host species are widely distributed, they are likely to encounter different nitrogen\u2010fixing bacterial communities in soils and nodules across their introduced and native ranges.Australia.NifH genes were amplified from rhizosphere soils collected from beneath each species (multiple populations) within their native and introduced range and directly from nodules collected from plants previously grown in the glasshouse using field\u2010collected soil as inoculum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=191137267911647288", "cites_id": ["191137267911647288"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12752", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OGA2HVUOpwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
