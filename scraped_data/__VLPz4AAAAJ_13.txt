We use the Linum marginale\u2014Melampsora lini plant\u2010pathogen system and a hierarchical spatial structure to investigate patterns of local adaptation within a metapopulation characterised by epidemic dynamics and frequent extinction of pathogen populations. Based on large sample sizes and comprehensive cross\u2010inoculation trials, our analyses demonstrate strong local adaptation by Melampsora to its host populations, with this effect being greatest at regional scales, as predicted from the broader spatial scales at which M. lini disperses relative to L. marginale. However, there was no consistent trend for more distant pathogen populations to perform more poorly. Our results further show how the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12211776173434409058", "cites_id": ["12211776173434409058"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01448.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YhAjnrrxeKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 10, "2006": 12, "2007": 14, "2008": 19, "2009": 15, "2010": 17, "2011": 13, "2012": 14, "2013": 12, "2014": 11, "2015": 13, "2016": 18, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 2}}
