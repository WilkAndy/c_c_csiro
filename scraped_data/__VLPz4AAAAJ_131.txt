This study investigated the effects of primary species groups (Acacia, Eucalyptus) used in shelterbelts in south-eastern Australia on soil microbial community structure, compared with those under adjacent pastures. The quantity and structure of bacterial and fungal communities was analysed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP). The fungal:bacterial ratio was highest under Eucalyptus trees but did not differ between Acacia and pasture. Both fungal and bacterial communities varied at different depths in the soil profile and across sampling periods. The dominant tree genus was a significant factor in observed differences in bulk soil bacterial and fungal communities compared to the surrounding pasture.
