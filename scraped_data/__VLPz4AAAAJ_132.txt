Each of three geographically restricted Acacia species (A. fulva, A. nano\u2010dealbata, and A. trachyphloia) and three widely distributed species (A. dealbata, A. implexa, and A. melanoxylon) were inoculated with 20 different rhizobial (Bradyrhizobium spp.) strains. The strains comprised two obtained from each of 10 different host species, including the six Acacia species listed above plus a further four species, A. cangaiensis, A. cincinnata, A. deanei, A. mearnsii. Neither restricted nor widely distributed species grew more effectively with their own strains than with strains isolated from other species. Thus, host species with restricted geographical ranges did not demonstrate greater specialization in their symbiotic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7124196958494054953", "cites_id": ["7124196958494054953"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-8903.2001.00086.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Kdr0XGM73mIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
