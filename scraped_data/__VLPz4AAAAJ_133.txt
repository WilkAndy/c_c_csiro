While variable, populations of C. maritima often show high levels of infection by a fungal pathogen, Alternaria brassicicola. As part of a larger metapopulation study of host\u2013pathogen dynamics in this system, an isozyme survey of seven populations of Cakile was carried out along the south coast of New South Wales to investigate mating structure. Given the possibility of self-incompatibility, a glasshouse crossing experiment was also carried out to investigate the potential for selfing. The results from the crossing study showed that C. maritima is basically an obligate outcrosser, but that self-compatible individuals also occur at low frequency, providing some flexibility in the mating system. Similarly, analysis of the isozyme data showed a preponderance of cross fertilisation, but with significant low levels of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1590211183235439410", "cites_id": ["1590211183235439410"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/bt99060", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MhuaVqWQERYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
