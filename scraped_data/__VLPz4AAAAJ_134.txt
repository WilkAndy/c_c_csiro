In particular, the spatial scale of interactions between pathogens and their hosts is of primary importance because migration rates of one species can affect both spatial and temporal heterogeneity of selection on the other. In this study we developed a stochastic and discrete time simulation model to specifically examine the joint effects of host and pathogen dispersal on the evolution of pathogen specialisation in a spatially explicit metapopulation. We consider a plant-pathogen system in which the host metapopulation is composed of two plant genotypes. The pathogen is dispersed by air-borne spores on the host metapopulation. The pathogen population is characterised by a single life-history trait under selection, the infection efficacy. We found that restricted host dispersal can lead to high amount of pathogen diversity and that the extent of pathogen specialisation varied according to the spatial scale of host-pathogen dispersal. We also discuss the role of population asynchrony in determining pathogen evolutionary outcomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14266406941807947747", "cites_id": ["14266406941807947747"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4y-h44Z1_MUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
