The collection and deployment of seed for revegetation is primarily based on local seed sources to preclude concerns associated with local adaptation as well as outbreeding depression in small remnant populations. For most species however, little is known about the levels of genetic diversity being sourced and deployed, or even of the levels of adaptively significant variation present across the species range. Acacia acinacea (Gold Dust wattle) is a key revegetation species widely distributed across south eastern Australia. Levels of variation in terms of morphology, fitness, ploidy level and AFLPs were assessed using seed lots from 35 populations across the Murray Darling Basin in south eastern Australia. Multivariate analysis indicated that three of the populations were misidentified while the remaining populations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12175972767168559775", "cites_id": ["12175972767168559775"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-005-7855-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n3rpfbi--agJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
