To investigate this issue, we used internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon pyrosequencing to characterise fungal communities within stems (endophytes) and soils associated with dieback-affected and healthy plants from populations of five exotic invasive species (Jatropha gossypiifolia, Mimosa pigra, Parkinsonia aculeata, Tamarix aphylla and Vachellia nilotica) across northern Australia. M. pigra and P. aculeata were sampled from multiple geographic regions. A total of 353 and 4926 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in stem and soil samples, respectively. Members of Ascomycota were common, representing 75% of stem and 49% of soil OTUs. Four common endophytes, including Cladosporium perangustum, were at least 50% more prevalent in healthy than dieback-affected samples \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5943313738295393986", "cites_id": ["5943313738295393986"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504817300107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wr7LH1vkelIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
