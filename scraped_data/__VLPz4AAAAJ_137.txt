Here, we develop a general quantitative framework for predicting changes in realized niche size and intrinsic population growth rate after introgression of disease resistance genes into wild host populations. We then apply this framework to a model host\u2013pathogen system targeted by genetically modified and conventionally bred disease-resistant host lines (Trifolium repens lines expressing resistance to Clover yellow vein potyvirus) and show that, under a range of ecologically realistic conditions, the introduction of novel pathogen resistance genes into host populations can pose a quantifiable risk to associated nontarget native plant communities. In the host\u2013pathogen system studied, we predict that pathogen release could result in an increase in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2360746017175525014", "cites_id": ["2360746017175525014"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0608356104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:llaqrv4NwyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
