In this study, we evaluated the role that host and symbiont phylogeny might play in determining patterns of mutualistic benefit for interactions among nine species of Acacia and 31 strains of nitrogen\u2010fixing rhizobial bacteria. Using phylogenetic comparative methods we compared patterns of variation in mutualistic benefit (host response to inoculation) to rhizobial phylogenies constructed from housekeeping and symbiosis genes; and a multigene host phylogeny. We found widespread genotype\u2010by\u2010genotype variation in patterns of plant growth. A relatively large component of this variation (21\u201328%) was strongly influenced by the interacting evolutionary histories of both partners, such that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8167782309692080060", "cites_id": ["8167782309692080060"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article-abstract/70/7/1473/6852348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vH_qY7zKWXEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
