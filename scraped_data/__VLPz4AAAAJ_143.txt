We developed a model to investigate STDs in the mating and social systems found in primates, and we tested predictions using comparative methods. In the model, groups were distributed on a square lattice in which males or females disperse and males undergo characteristic dominance trajectories at maturity (challenge vs. queuing). We investigated the impact of mating rate, mating skew, migration rate of males or females, and group size on disease spread and prevalence. The model generated several predictions: 1) STD prevalence is higher in females than males; 2) STD risk increases with copulation rate; 3) high skew is negatively associated with STD risk; 4) STD risk is higher for all individuals when females disperse and 5) when mortality rates are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13585688902337456042", "cites_id": ["13585688902337456042"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10764-014-9781-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qmfKnBMQirwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
