In these situations it is attacked by the fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola (Dematiaceae), which forms necrotic lesions on all above-ground parts. Cakile plants produce dimorphic fruits, with half of the seeds produced by C. maritima being adapted for dispersal by water. This raises the possibility that pathogen movement among host populations may occur as a consequence of wave action and ocean currents. A field survey showed that 30% of the seeds were infected with A. brassicicola, with the frequency of infection positively correlated with lesion density on the fruit surface. Glasshouse inoculation trials demonstrated that infection of seeds could occur either through the flowers or, more readily, when spores were deposited on fruits. Seedlings grown from field-collected seeds were found to emerge with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14073746531577370953", "cites_id": ["14073746531577370953"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BT/BT00068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SRmOkef9T8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
