Despite their wide use, little is known about the effects of establishing shelterbelts on soil macro invertebrates, especially earthworms, which are of major importance in soil processes. We assessed earthworm composition, diversity and biomass in three land use systems: native shelterbelts dominated by Acacia and Eucalyptus species, agricultural pastures and native remnant woodland fragments dominated by Eucalyptus blakelyi and/or Eucalyptus melliodora. Earthworm communities differed significantly among systems, with abundance, biomass and diversity greatest under pasture. Within shelterbelts we saw a shift from high earthworm biomass and density to low with increasing time after establishment. Soil edaphic variables did not correlate strongly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1225375868156597341", "cites_id": ["1225375868156597341"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139314003357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XVTPGdxoAREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
