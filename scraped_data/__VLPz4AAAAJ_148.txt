This study investigated patterns of resistance and virulence in a hybrid zone between \u201dbog\u201d and \u201dhill\u201d ecotypes of the native Australian flax, Linum marginale, where the host is subject to attack by the rust pathogen, Melampsora lini. Analysis of the resistance structure of adjoining bog, hill and hybrid populations found that bog plants were generally susceptible to pathogen isolates taken from all these sites, but that hybrids exhibited resistance levels similar to the more resistant hill plants. Similarly, the virulence structure of rust isolates collected from the hybrid population was more similar to that of the hill isolates than the bog. Controlled crosses between bog and hill plants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15507983935555943154", "cites_id": ["15507983935555943154"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420050937", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8rpGfTltN9cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
