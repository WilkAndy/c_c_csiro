One useful approach is to examine congeners varying in invasiveness in a comparative framework across native and invaded ranges. Acacia species have been widely introduced outside their native range of Australia, and a subset of these species have become invasive in multiple parts of the world. Within specific regions, the invasive status of these species varies. Our study examined whether a key mechanism in the life history of Acacia species, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, influences acacia invasiveness on a regional scale. To assess the extent to which species varying in invasiveness correspondingly differ with regard to the diversity of rhizobia they associate with, we grew seven Acacia species ranging in invasiveness in California in multiple soils from both their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10583491427339669689", "cites_id": ["10583491427339669689"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plw060/2609619", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uRD5IWEd4JIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
