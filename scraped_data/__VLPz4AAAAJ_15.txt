The focus of this review is on the evolution of plant defence responses and the coevolution of their pathogens, primarily from a molecular-genetic perspective. It explores the evolution of the major types of plant defence responses including pathogen associated molecular patterns and effector triggered immunity as well as the forces driving pathogen evolution, such as the mechanisms by which pathogen lineages and species evolve. Advances in our understanding of plant defence signalling, stomatal regulation, R gene\u2013effector interactions and host specific toxins are used to highlight recent insights into the coevolutionary arms race between pathogens and plants. Finally, the review considers the intriguing question of how plants have evolved the ability to distinguish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9920211653522664873", "cites_id": ["9920211653522664873"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/FP09304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qa3oePCrq4kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 14, "2014": 16, "2015": 13, "2016": 19, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 23, "2020": 23, "2021": 19, "2022": 33, "2023": 7}}
