However, there are surprisingly little data investigating the long\u2010term fitness impacts and genetic consequences that arise from pathogen infection in natural populations. Here, we address this gap through the analysis of a dataset investigating the local population dynamics of a native host plant (Linum marginale) and an associated rust pathogen (Melampsora lini) across 12 years. To investigate patterns of disease prevalence and severity and track effects on host fecundity and demography, we conducted censuses on an annual basis at a single site. Annual M. lini infection prevalence ranged from 0% to 99%. Severe epidemics occurred in 3\u2010 to 4\u2010year cycles causing high overwintering mortality and subsequent changes in the relative abundance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14311459162347444070", "cites_id": ["14311459162347444070"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.12740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zpc6ZUiEnMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
