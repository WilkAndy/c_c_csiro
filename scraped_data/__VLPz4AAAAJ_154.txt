The importance of understanding such interactions to develop strategies for the effective deployment of fungal pathogens as biological control agents in new environments is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3912435471351822418", "cites_id": ["3912435471351822418"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9780851997353.0001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UjiQDFXDSzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
