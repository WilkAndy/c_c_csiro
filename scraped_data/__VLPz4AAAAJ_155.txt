This implies there should be a phylogenetic signal in the outcome of feedbacks between plants and the soil microbiota they cultivate. However, attempts to identify a phylogenetic signal in plant\u2013soil feedbacks have produced mixed results. Here we clarify how phylogenetic signals could arise in plant\u2013soil feedbacks and use a recent compilation of data from feedback experiments to identify: whether there is a phylogenetic signal in the outcome of plant\u2013soil feedbacks; and whether any signal arises through directional or divergent changes in feedback outcomes with evolutionary time. We find strong evidence for a divergent phylogenetic signal in feedback outcomes. Distantly related plant species show more divergent responses to each other\u2019s soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10268415276951701329", "cites_id": ["10268415276951701329"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.16768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UYfmPEq9gI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 1, "2023": 5}}
