We assessed intra- and interspecific variation in the soil fungal communities of five legumes native to either south-east (Acacia longifolia, Acacia melanoxylon \u2013 invasive in the south-west) or south-west (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, Paraserianthes lophantha \u2013 invasive in the south-east) Australia across their Australian non-native and native ranges. Soil samples were collected from around the roots (up to 5 cm) of each legume species from multiple populations and soil fungal communities were amplified and 454 pyrosequenced. Results revealed a significant interaction between host species and geographic location (i.e., south-east vs south-west) suggesting that among-population differences in fungal communities were largely driven by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14491571639692933503", "cites_id": ["14491571639692933503"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071714001783", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f7kFbaBnHMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
