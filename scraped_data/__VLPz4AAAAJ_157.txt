We use an individual\u2010based spatial simulation to investigate the demographic and genetic consequences of different self\u2010incompatibility systems for plants that vary in reproductive capacity and lifespan. The results support the idea that, in the absence of inbreeding effects, populations of self\u2010incompatible species will often be smaller and less viable than self\u2010compatible species, particularly for shorter\u2010lived organisms or where potential fecundity is low. At high ovule production and low mortality, self\u2010incompatible and self\u2010compatible species are demographically similar, thus self\u2010incompatibility does not automatically lead to reduced mate availability or population viability. Overall, sporophytic codominant self\u2010incompatibility was more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3619258617893619997", "cites_id": ["3619258617893619997"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.963", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HQnSjYkwOjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
