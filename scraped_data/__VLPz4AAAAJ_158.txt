In a glasshouse trial, we tested whether field\u2010collected scats of Fallow Deer (Dama dama) contained viable plant seeds. Scats of deer obtained from a woodland study area in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales, produced seedlings from a range of native and introduced plant species. Forbs and herbs were dominant in these samples, confirming the grazing behaviour of deer at the time scats were collected. Samples of scats from Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), collected contemporaneously from the same sites as deer scats, also produced plant germinants. By volume, deer scats produced a greater diversity of plant germinants, including native and weed species, than did \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6027943077845125717", "cites_id": ["6027943077845125717"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/emr.12193", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vco7uUqOp1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
