Allelic richness and fixation coefficient were correlated with the log population size, suggesting that reduced population size is accompanied by genetic erosion, primarily due to a loss of rare (q<0.1) alleles, and increased inbreeding. Comparative germination and growth studies of seed from five populations representing three different levels of inbreeding (low F=0.34, medium F=0.43, high F=0.57) showed a significant reduction in percentage seed germination at 2 weeks in the single high F treatment population. There were no effects on survivorship and growth beyond this up until 141 days. Results suggest that polyploidy has not prevented erosion of genetic variation at the population level, as has previously been suggested \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 204, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=874283230705199516", "cites_id": ["874283230705199516"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320799001500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nKlDV_cTIgwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 10, "2003": 12, "2004": 15, "2005": 8, "2006": 17, "2007": 12, "2008": 12, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 11, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
