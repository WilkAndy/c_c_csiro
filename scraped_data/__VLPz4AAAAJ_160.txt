Patterns of disease and host resistance were surveyed in an archipelago subject to land-uplift where populations of S. dioica constitute an age-structured metapopulation, and in three contrasting areas within the mainland range of L. alpina, where population distributions range from continuous, through patchy but spatially connected to highly isolated demes. In S. dioica, disease levels depend on the age, size and density of local patches and populations. Disease is most predictably found in larger dense host patches and populations of intermediate age, and more frequently goes extinct in small old populations. The rate of local disease spread is affected by the level of host resistance; S. dioica \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15030397456473245619", "cites_id": ["15030397456473245619"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10658-013-0316-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s8cFKtqyltAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
