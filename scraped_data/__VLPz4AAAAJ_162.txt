Specifically, there may be spatial variation in the distribution of compatible microbes, and species\u2010specific variation in plant host ability to associate with available microbes. Although either or both factors could promote or limit invasion, the scale over which most studies are conducted makes it difficult to examine these two possibilities simultaneously. However, this is critical to identifying a role of soil microbes in invasion. A series of recent research projects focused on interactions between Australian Acacia and nitrogen\u2010fixing bacteria (rhizobia) at multiple spatial scales, from the local to the inter\u2010continental, has allowed us to evaluate this question. Collectively, this research reveals that nodulation, performance and rhizobial community composition are all broadly similar across spatial scales \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6176066718879777961", "cites_id": ["6176066718879777961"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qQTxZ_XLtVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
