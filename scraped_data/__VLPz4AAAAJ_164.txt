The evolutionary patterns that result from the interaction of these factors are still relatively poorly understood. Recently, integration of the appropriate spatial and temporal context of the metapopulation has permitted an essential conceptual advance stressing the importance of these factors in evolutionary interactions. Yet, a major aspect of host and pathogen biologies that still needs considerable attention is that of the impact of particular life-history traits of both host and pathogen and how these may influence patterns of disease incidence and prevalence and the evolution of host resistance and pathogen infectivity. Here we outline the importance of both empirical comparisons and simulation modelling as a means of uncovering the full impact of host and pathogen life history traits on co-evolutionary dynamics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14674606862461591012", "cites_id": ["14674606862461591012"], "pub_url": "https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/download/44032.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5F2IJzGtpssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
