These imperatives are underpinned by food security concerns, climate predictability and global connectivity, reinforcing the likelihood of further major changes in agricultural landscapes and associated production systems in coming decades. These changes are likely to include adoption of novel genetic technologies and agronomic practices, shifts in patterns of land-use and perhaps even new crop species.
