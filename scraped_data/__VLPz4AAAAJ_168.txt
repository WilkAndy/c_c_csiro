Such interdependent demographic dynamics result in situations where the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in determining ecological processes is complicated to decipher. Using a detailed survey of three metapopulations of the succulent plant Cakile maritima and the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola located along the southeastern Australian coast, we developed a series of statistical analyses\u2014namely, synchrony analysis, patch occupancy dynamics, and a spatially explicit metapopulation model\u2014to understand how habitat quality, weather conditions, dispersal, and spatial structure determine metapopulation dynamics. Climatic conditions are important drivers, likely explaining the high synchrony among \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13408824068710444695", "cites_id": ["13408824068710444695"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/712248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l64xj3K2FboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
