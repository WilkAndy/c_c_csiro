While some exotic species establish, spread and impact native ecosystems, others establish with little or no measurable impact. Competitive ability has been highlighted as a key mechanism influencing invasion success and impact, but there is growing evidence that interactions between plants and soil biota may also be important. In particular, escape from natural enemies during the early stages of establishment may give exotic species an advantage over native species subject to their own natural enemies in the soil. Here, we evaluated whether the invasion success and impact of exotic grass species could be explained by competitive superiority over resident native species, advantages gained from the positive effects of native soil communities, or both. We assessed the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16765155352507908006", "cites_id": ["16765155352507908006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405621000433", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pv94rvfLqegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
