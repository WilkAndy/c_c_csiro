Ecological differentiation often occurs at fine genomic levels, yet it is unclear how to utilise ecological information to define ecotypes given the breadth of environmental variation among microbial taxa. Here, we present an analytical framework that infers clusters along genome\u2010based microbial phylogenies according to shared environmental responses. The advantage of our approach is the ability to identify genomic clusters that best fit complex environmental information whilst characterising cluster niches through model predictions. We apply our method to determine climate\u2010associated ecotypes in populations of nitrogen\u2010fixing symbionts using whole genomes, explicitly sampled to detect climate differentiation across a heterogeneous landscape.
