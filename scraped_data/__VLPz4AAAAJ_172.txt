A total of 288 isolates were collected, among which 25 distinct AFLP genotypes were identified. These genotypes were classified into two main groups corresponding to known vegetative compatibility groups (VCG)\u201401111 and 01112. The Fov populations were dominated by four genotypes (I-A, I-B, II-A, II-B) that accounted for 87.5% of the isolates. Significant temporal variation was observed in both sampled fields with 6.8% and 10.7% of total genetic variation being attributed to differences among collections in different years. Genetic diversity based on Nei\u2019s gene diversity and the Shannon-Wiener index increased over time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17399494569182785996", "cites_id": ["17399494569182785996"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10658-010-9690-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zHF6yx9sd_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
