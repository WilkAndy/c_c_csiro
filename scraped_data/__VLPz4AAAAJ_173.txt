Unfortunately, the dynamics of most natural pathosystems are poorly understood, and risk assessment of disease\u2010resistant plants remains a challenge. Here we describe the first stage of a multi\u2010tiered risk assessment strategy aimed at quantifying potential ecological release in a model pathosystem (the weedy pasture species Trifolium repens infected with Clover yellow vein virus; ClYVV) in order to assess the level of risk posed by genetically modified and conventionally bred disease\u2010resistant host genotypes to non\u2010target plant communities in south\u2010eastern Australia.
