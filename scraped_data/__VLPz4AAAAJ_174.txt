However, within those outcomes the speed of co-evolutionary responses and the extent of their expression in the resistance/virulence structure of wild plant and pathogen populations respectively, are highly variable characters changing from place-to-place and time-to-time as a result of the interaction of host and pathogen with the physical environment. As a consequence, understanding of the role of diseases in the evolution of their hosts requires approaches that simultaneously deal with host and pathogen structures over multiple populations within a metapopulation framework."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3457714737943878544", "cites_id": ["3457714737943878544"], "pub_url": "https://www.old-aj.cz/publicFiles/232938.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kBvHATxF_C8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
