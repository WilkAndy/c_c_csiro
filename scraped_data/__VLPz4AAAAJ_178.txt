However, rapid pathogen evolution is causing the breakdown of resistance and threatening disease control. Recent research efforts have identified strategies for resistance gene deployment that aim to disrupt pathogen adaptation and prevent breakdown. To date, there has been limited practical uptake of such strategies. In this paper, we focus on the socio-economic challenges associated with translating applied evolutionary research into scientifically informed management strategies to control pathogen adaptation. We develop a conceptual framework for the economic valuation of resistance and demonstrate that in addition to various direct benefits, resistance delivers considerable indirect and non-market value to farmers and society.
