However, little is known with respect to the diversity and distribution of most key revegetation species or the environmental and anthropogenic factors that may affect their demography and genetic structure. In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of two widespread Australian legume species (Acacia salicina and Acacia stenophylla) in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin (MDB), a large agriculturally utilized region in Australia, and assessed the impact of landscape structure on genetic differentiation. We used AFLP genetic data and sampled a total of 28 A. salicina and 30 A. stenophylla sampling locations across southeastern Australia. We specifically evaluated the importance of four landscape features: forest cover, land cover, water stream cover, and elevation. We found that both species had high genetic diversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4502188190213891422", "cites_id": ["4502188190213891422"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6952", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XmWoLU78ej4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
