However, debate has focused on genetic variation that is neutral rather than under selection. This distinction is particularly important in antagonistic or co-evolutionary interactions such as host-pathogen or predator-prey systems. Plant host-pathogen systems provide some of the best examples of studies in which numerical and genetic dynamics have been investigated in a spatially explicit context, and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. 2 Empirical studies of natural host-pathogen interactions have shown that, while in some cases pathogens appear to be locally adapted to their hosts, in others there is no local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes. Recent theory suggests that the dynamics (epidemic vs. endemic) and migration rates of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16171350600617118533", "cites_id": ["16171350600617118533"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2960598", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RUsVGLEtbOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 10, "2000": 10, "2001": 12, "2002": 11, "2003": 9, "2004": 9, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 10, "2013": 5, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 8}}
