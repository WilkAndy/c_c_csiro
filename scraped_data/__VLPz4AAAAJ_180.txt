For microbes that have symbiotic relationships with plants, an important factor that may influence their communities is host size or age, yet this has received little attention.Using tree diameter size as a proxy for age, we quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with an endemic legume, Acacia acuminata, of variable size across a climate gradient in southwest Australia. We examined the 16S rRNA diversity (V1-V3 hypervariable region) of rhizobia at the taxonomic level and at higher sequence level diversity within taxonomic groups.We identified 3 major taxonomic clades that associated with Acacia acuminata: Bradyrhizobiaceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Burkholderiaceae. Within these groups, we found extensive genetic variability, especially within Bradyrhizobiaceae. Using binomial multivariate statistical models that controlled for other factors that affect plant size and rhizobia community structure (climate and local soil characteristics), we determined that soil sampled at the base of larger Acacia trees was much more likely to contain a greater number of taxonomic clades and cryptic genetic variants within the Rhizobiaceae clade.Despite strong influences of climate and highly heterogeneous soil conditions on rhizobial diversity, our results show that host tree size is a prominent factor in structuring nitrogen-fixing symbionts diversity across a large landscape. The identification of a positive relationship between plant host size and microbial diversity raise interesting questions about the role of plant host size in driving ecological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6313763529905722969", "cites_id": ["6313763529905722969"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/246611.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WdbYi3r-nlcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
