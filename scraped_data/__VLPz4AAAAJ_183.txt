In particular, the symbiotic relationship between legumes and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria (i.e. rhizobia) may be influential in invasion success. Legumes, including Australian acacias, have been introduced into novel ranges around the world. Our goal was to examine the acacia\u2013rhizobia symbiosis to determine whether cointroduction of non-native mutualists plays a role in invasiveness of introduced legumes. To determine whether acacias were introduced abroad concurrently with native symbionts, we selected four species introduced to California (two invasive and two noninvasive in the region) and identified rhizobial strains associating with each species in their native and novel ranges. We amplified three genes to examine phylogenetic placement (16S rRNA) and provenance (nifD and nodC) of rhizobia associating with acacias in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/98/12/fiac138/6832278", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i08bu4XmGaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
