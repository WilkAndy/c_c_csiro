However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome the resistance. This often occurs very quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and continuing needs to breed new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations and thus increase resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on using different combinations of resistance genes (eg qualitative and/or quantitative resistance) in time, space, or both (eg via gene pyramiding, cultivar rotations, cultivar mixtures, field mosaics). However, experimental assessment of the efficiency (ie ability to reduce disease impact) and the durability (ie ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of different deployment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13281813091866651952&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
