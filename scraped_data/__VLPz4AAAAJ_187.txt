This study investigated the effects of primary species groups (Acacia, Eucalyptus) used in shelterbelts in south-eastern Australia on soil microbial community structure compared with those under adjacent pastures. The ratio and structure of bacterial and fungal communities was analysed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The fungal: bacterial ratio (copy number) was highest under Eucalyptus trees but did not differ between Acacia and pasture. Both fungal and bacterial communities varied at different depths in the soil profile and across sampling periods. The dominant tree genus was a significant factor in observed differences in bulk soil bacterial and fungal communities compared to the surrounding pasture. The effect of tree type on fungal communities was more pronounced than on bacterial communities. Fungal communities not only differed between shelterbelts and pastures, but also between Acacia and Eucalyptus dominated shelterbelts. These patterns were consistently observed at different soil depths. Shelterbelt systems which contain a mixture of different plant genera have the potential to exhibit greater microbial community heterogeneity than single species plantations. Maintaining a variety of tree species during afforestation may therefore contribute to conserving important bacterial and fungal diversity in agricultural landscapes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/163941/1/Daniela%20Carnovale%20PhD%20thesis.pdf#page=138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HKS6QpGs5xgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
