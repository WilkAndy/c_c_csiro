However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs very quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to breed new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations and thus increase the durability of resistance deployment. These strategies mainly rely on using different combinations of resistance sources in time, space, or both. In time, such combination consists of crop rotations. In space, resistance sources can be deployed in the same cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental assessment of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1503785845575684457&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
