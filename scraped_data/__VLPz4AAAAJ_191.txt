However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance, resulting in significant crop losses. We developed a spatially explicit model to investigate the potential for different resistance gene deployment strategies to provide both efficient (ability to reduce disease impact) and durable (ability to limit pathogen adaptation) disease controla."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6431974594780248553&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
