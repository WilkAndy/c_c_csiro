Historically, and perhaps also for heuristic and practical reasons, primacy has been given to a study of processes within populations. Recently, however, a number of issues have forced greater attention on population processes at a regional scale. These issues include practical problems such as predicting the consequences of habitat fragmentation (Burkey 1989; Wilcox 1990), as well as conceptual advances such as the demonstration that populations which cannot persist locally may still show equilibrium persistence on a regional scale (Levins 1969; Caswell 1978; Hanski and Gilpin 1991) and that genetic structure can be greatly affected not just by migration among extant populations but by colonization and extinction processes (McCauley 1991). Above all there has been an increasing recognition that in nature no population is an isolated entity, and that this reality needs to be quan-tified and its consequences need to be explored. Metapopulations (sys-tems of interconnected populations) are more likely to be the rule, not the exception.The major theoretical and empirical issue at the heart of discussions about metapopulations is how the global behavior of a system of interconnected populations can be understood in terms of the local dynamics of individual populations, their degree of synchrony, and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8967392999151124587", "cites_id": ["8967392999151124587"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VJorDgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA146&dq=info:a0C642uUcnwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=v18_dy-ULZ&sig=8fc53waWS44xIfi5u7ae1VNRqCM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a0C642uUcnwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 6, "1996": 12, "1997": 14, "1998": 10, "1999": 20, "2000": 14, "2001": 11, "2002": 6, "2003": 13, "2004": 9, "2005": 12, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 0, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
