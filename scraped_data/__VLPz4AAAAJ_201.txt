Nitrogen fixing bacterial communities of invasive acacias in Australia", "pub_year": 2013, "citation": "", "author": "C Birnbaum and A Bissett and PH Thrall and MR Leishman", "abstract": "Although some Australian acacias are amongst the most notable invaders world-wide, information on the relative role of soil biota, particularly beneficial microbial communities such as rhizobia, in their invasion success remains elusive. We examined the nitrogen fixing bacteria (henceforth NFB, focus on rhizobia) in native and introduced populations across New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia of four weedy Acacia spp. and a sister-taxa Paraserianthes lophantha using 454 sequencing to identify the NFB community composition and diversity in the rhizophere and nodules. We hypothesized that if these acacias are specialists, they will associate with similar NFB subsets in their nodules across the continent and are likely to be constrained in the introduced populations if compatible microorganisms are absent from the rhizosphere. However, if these acacias are generalists, they will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/33228/", "cites_per_year": {}}
