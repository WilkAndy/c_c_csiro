These invasive Acacias may have a detrimental effect on native flora and induce changes to below-ground microbial composition. Previous studies have shown that the invasive success of Acacias can be at least partly attributed to their ability to associate with N-fixing rhizobial bacteria. This study assessed the role of rhizobia in the invasion success of four Acacia species (A. cyclops, A. longifolia, A. melanoxylon, A. saligna) and closely related species Paraserianthes lophantha in their nonnative environment within Australia. Presence or absence of rhizobia in soils in both the native and introduced ranges of each species, as well as infectivity and efficacy, were estimated using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method to determine numbers of rhizobial cells/g-1 of soil. A glasshouse experiment had shown that there \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/33952/", "cites_per_year": {}}
