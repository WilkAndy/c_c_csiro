Specific topics covered include the following: reciprocal insights into adaptation from agricultural and evolutionary studies in tomato; evolutionary response of landraces to climate change in centers of crop diversity; evolution of weeds and invasives from domesticated ancestors; local origin of two vegetative compatibility groups of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum in Australia; the interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant; evolutionary ecology of mycorrhizal functional diversity in agricultural systems; evolutionary ecology of insect adaptation to Bt crops; and adaptive management of pest resistance by Helicoverpa species in Australia to the Cry2Ab Bt toxin in Bollgard II cotton."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103289299", "cites_per_year": {}}
