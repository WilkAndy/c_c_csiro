I suspect that for many empirical biologists, this may seem like a fairly mysterious pathway, in part, because as pointed out by Otto and Day in one of the two books under review here, primary research papers commonly leave out many of the intermediate steps in model development due to space and presentation constraints. Not surprisingly, the importance of model interpretation is a theme common to both books being reviewed here. Biologists need to be able to understand and articulate key model results from incomplete information.Over the past several decades, there has been a diversity of books written about modeling approaches in ecology and evolutionary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article-abstract/62/3/711/6853544", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VzDCzQBhon4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
