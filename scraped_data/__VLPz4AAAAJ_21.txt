Relatively little work has examined other aspects of ecological and evolutionary relationships between host social and sexual behaviour, and dynamics and prevalence of infectious diseases; this is particularly evident with respect to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here, we use a simulation approach to investigate rates of STD spread in host mating systems ranging from permanent monogamy to serial polygyny or polyandry and complete promiscuity. The model assumes that one sex (female) is differentially attracted to the other, such that groups of varying size are formed within which mating and disease transmission occur. The results show that equilibrium disease levels are generally higher in females than males and are a function of variance in male mating success and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 190, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8471676654307272382", "cites_id": ["8471676654307272382"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2000.1178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vmb0PwhxkXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 7, "2004": 7, "2005": 10, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 12, "2013": 12, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
