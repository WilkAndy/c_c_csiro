He outlines some difficult challenges that require new approaches (eg high throughput genotyping to characterize multi-species geographical selection mosaics) but which offer exciting research opportunities. He also demonstrates an impressive command of some fascinating biology, which he uses to underpin each conceptual or theoretical argument developed in the book. My favourite examples include ants that cultivate fungi for food and the mutualistic bacteria that they use to reduce attack by yet another fungus, and the differential use of diploid and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(05)00165-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PAK6iJge92UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
