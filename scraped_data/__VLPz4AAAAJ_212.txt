We report on a greenhouse-based experiment to investigate the effect of disease severity and duration on growth and reproduction of these plants. Differences between the two species were evident in mean plant height, leaf number, mean plant weight, pod weight, seed weight and other agronomic measures of yield. Species differed in their reaction to infection-CM developed more severe disease than CE (Area Under the Disease Progress Curve= 639 vs 446, respectively). Growth and reproductive potential of both species was significantly reduced by the infection. For example, CM plant height was reduced by up to 30%, and leaf number by 50%. The number of pods was reduced by 70%, and up to 100% of seed was infected with Alternaria (CE responded similarly). Infection with A. brassicicola reduces growth and reproductive potential of CM and CE, and disease can result in seed infection that reduces fitness of the subsequent generation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=162936", "cites_per_year": {}}
