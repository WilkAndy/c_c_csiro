The problem is that we can diminish the interval t and find a more suitable cause, El\", of E2; and, according to Russell, we can continue to do this indefinitely since the time series is compact. Sober raises just this problem: Given events D, P, and E, if the screening-off requirement tells us to explain E in terms of P instead of D, there will always be an event P\" located between P and E on that chain such that screening-off requires us to explain E in terms of P\" instead of P. Thus, Sober seems to say, screening-off is not an adequate or accurate guide to explanatory power. If we switch from an ontology of events to one of causal processes and causal interactions, does the same problem arise? For Salmon (1984, 139\u2013157), a causal process persists through space and time; it is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/31081672/Sober_on_Brandon_on_Screening_Off.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D3HbrFkLHZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
