This is particularly true for agro\u2010ecosystems, which not only comprise a significant proportion of land use, but which also involve conflicting imperatives to expand or intensify production while simultaneously reducing environmental impacts. These imperatives reinforce the likelihood of further major changes in agriculture over the next 30\u201340\u2003years. Key transformations include genetic technologies as well as changes in land use. The use of evolutionary principles is not new in agriculture (e.g. crop breeding, domestication of animals, management of selection for pest resistance), but given land\u2010use trends and other transformative processes in production landscapes, ecological and evolutionary research in agro\u2010ecosystems must \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6471917568168317459", "cites_id": ["6471917568168317459"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00179.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E1JIEr3e0FkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 13, "2013": 17, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 17, "2019": 18, "2020": 17, "2021": 24, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
