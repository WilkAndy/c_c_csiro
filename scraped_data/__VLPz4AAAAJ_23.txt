However, few theoretical or empirical studies have examined such systems in natural situations, and as a consequence, there is little knowledge of how spatial effects are likely to influence the evolution of host resistance and pathogen virulence in gene\u2010for\u2010gene interactions. In this work, a simulation approach was used to investigate the epidemiological and genetic consequences of varying host and pathogen dispersal in metapopulation situations. The results demonstrate clear impacts of dispersal distance on the total number of host and pathogen genotypes that are maintained, as well as on genetic variation at individual host resistance and pathogen virulence loci. Several other important results also emerged from this study. In contrast to the predictions of many earlier nonspatial models, so\u2010called \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17608007160801284431", "cites_id": ["17608007160801284431"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3059.2002.00683.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T1EYtjg1XPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 10, "2004": 9, "2005": 5, "2006": 12, "2007": 10, "2008": 17, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 15, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 12, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
