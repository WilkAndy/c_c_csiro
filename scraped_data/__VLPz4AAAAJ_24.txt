While it is generally accepted in medical, veterinary and agricultural contexts that variation in host resistance and pathogen virulence and aggressiveness is of central importance to understanding patterns of infection, there has been remarkably little effort to directly investigate causal links between population genetic structure and disease dynamics, and even less work on factors influencing host\u2013pathogen coevolution. The lack of empirical evidence is particularly surprising, given the potential for such variation to not only affect disease dynamics and prevalence, but also when or where new diseases or pathotypes emerge. Increasingly, this lack of knowledge has led to calls for an integrated approach to disease management, incorporating both ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we argue that plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7506173874427954332", "cites_id": ["7506173874427954332"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2007.00005.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nISYj15JK2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 10, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 15, "2015": 14, "2016": 16, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 18, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
