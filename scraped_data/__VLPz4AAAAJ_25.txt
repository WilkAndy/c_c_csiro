Studies show that plant\u2013fungal associations are frequently key drivers of plant invasion success and impact, but clear conceptual frameworks and integration across studies are needed to move beyond a series of case studies towards a more predictive understanding. Here, we consider linked plant\u2013fungal invasions from the perspective of plant and fungal origin, simplified to the least complex representations or \u2018motifs\u2019. By characterizing these interaction motifs, parallels in invasion processes between pathogen and mutualist fungi become clear, although the outcomes are often opposite in effect. These interaction motifs provide hypotheses for fungal\u2010driven \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2477811839889771702", "cites_id": ["2477811839889771702"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.14657", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tgzjiL30YiIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 19, "2019": 26, "2020": 50, "2021": 30, "2022": 27, "2023": 7}}
