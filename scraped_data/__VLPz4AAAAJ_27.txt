The next challenge lies in further integration of these approaches to develop a comprehensive picture of how life history traits of both players interact with the environment to shape evolutionary trajectories."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10662577377627369246", "cites_id": ["10662577377627369246"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1171663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Hm-Y16EV-ZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 15, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 18, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 14, "2018": 11, "2019": 17, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
