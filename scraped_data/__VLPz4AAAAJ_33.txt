Variation in effectiveness was primarily between rhizobial isolates within a host species rather than across rhizobial isolates from different hosts. No interactions were found between host population, host origin of rhizobial strain and rhizobial isolate. 2.\u2002A study using a range of less common Acacia species showed significant variation in performance of several species (A. silvestris, A. nano\u2010dealbata, A. trachyphloia, A. filicifolia, A. leucoclada) as a function of the inoculating rhizobial strain; two other species (A. cangaiensis, A. glaucocarpa) were marginally non\u2010significant. For A. filicifolia and A. silvestris, growth was significantly better when plants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13850462308867675238", "cites_id": ["13850462308867675238"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00470.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZpT-Rha6NsAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
