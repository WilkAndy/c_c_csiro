Male plants experienced a higher rate of infection because they initiated flowering earlier and produced more flowers than females. 5 There was greater over-wintering mortality of diseased plants than healthy plants in years when overall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16880658154042490626", "cites_id": ["16880658154042490626"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2261263", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Av-ATiclROoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 6, "1996": 13, "1997": 10, "1998": 7, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 4, "2002": 10, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 7, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
