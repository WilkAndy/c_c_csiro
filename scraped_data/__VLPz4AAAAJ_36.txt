In this opinion article, we argue that knowledge of the fundamental factors that drive host\u2013pathogen coevolution in wild systems can provide new insights into disease development in agriculture. Such evolutionary principles can be used to guide the formulation of sustainable disease management strategies which can minimize disease epidemics while simultaneously reducing pressure on pathogens to evolve increased infectivity and aggressiveness. To ensure agricultural sustainability, disease management programs that reflect the dynamism of pathogen population structure are essential and evolutionary biologists should play an increasing role in their design."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17954357002748116223", "cites_id": ["17954357002748116223"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138514001174", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_zxZV5GwKvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 20, "2017": 13, "2018": 14, "2019": 16, "2020": 17, "2021": 20, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
