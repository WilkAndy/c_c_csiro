For example, nutrient-poor Australian soils are often dominated by shrubby legumes (e.g. species of Acacia). However, relatively few studies have quantified patterns of diversity, host-specificity and effectiveness of these ecologically important plant\u2013microbe interactions. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequence and PCR-RFLP analyses were used to examine bacterial strains isolated from the root nodules of two widespread south-eastern Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and Acacia stenophylla, across nearly 60 sites. The results showed that there was extensive genetic diversity in microbial populations, including a broad range of novel genomic species. While previous studies have suggested that most native Australian legumes nodulate primarily with species of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4166672111938908766", "cites_id": ["4166672111938908766"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.021014-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XjKltzX-0jkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 15, "2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
