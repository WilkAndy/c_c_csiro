Broadly virulent pathogens occurred more frequently in highly resistant host populations, whereas avirulent pathogens dominated susceptible populations. Experimental inoculations indicated a negative trade-off between spore production and virulence. The nonrandom spatial distribution of pathogens, maintained through time despite high pathogen mobility, implies that selection favors virulent strains ofMelampsora lini in resistant Linum marginalepopulations and avirulent strains in susceptible populations. These results are consistent with gene-for-gene models of host-pathogen coevolution that require trade-offs to prevent pathogen virulence increasing until host resistance becomes selectively neutral."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 423, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5845770898801455090", "cites_id": ["5845770898801455090"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1080070", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8m9gBalZIFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 8, "2004": 18, "2005": 20, "2006": 20, "2007": 26, "2008": 22, "2009": 28, "2010": 14, "2011": 25, "2012": 25, "2013": 17, "2014": 25, "2015": 27, "2016": 22, "2017": 25, "2018": 20, "2019": 20, "2020": 21, "2021": 17, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
