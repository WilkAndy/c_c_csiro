Only four resistance phenotypes were common (occurring at an overall frequency of > 5%) and pathogen populations were similarly variable, with five out of 44 virulence phenotypes classified as common. 3 Resistance and virulence structure were related to the occurrence of two distinct ecotypes of the host. Hill populations were consistently more resistant than those in bogs and their pathogen populations more virulent. Allozyme analysis showed a high degree of genetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15233330819363881894", "cites_id": ["15233330819363881894"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3072148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:psMxqqupZ9MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 13, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
