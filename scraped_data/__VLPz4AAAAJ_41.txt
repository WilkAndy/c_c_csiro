We use individual-based models that incorporate measurable per-contact probabilities of infection and fertilization to show that not only can the presence of sexually transmitted (and sterilizing) pathogen have significant effects on optimal within-season mating strategies for both males and females. We show that, contrary to expectations, monogamy is not always predicted to be the optimal strategy. The optimal strategy may also often differ between the two sexes, and the optimal strategy will not always be the one that minimizes disease transmission. Similarly, we show that the optimal level of virulence for a sexually transmitted pathogen is a function of the degree of promiscuity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14146080346135996498", "cites_id": ["14146080346135996498"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/286001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UiiSKyD5UMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
