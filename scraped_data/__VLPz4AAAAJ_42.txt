We use their conceptual framework to summarize our collaborative research on the ecological genetics of the anther\u2014smut disease of Silene alba caused by the fungus Ustilago violacea. Our theoretical investigations have revealed the importance of the rate and mode of disease transmission on the likelihood of coexistence between host and pathogen. Our empirical studies have quantified patterns of disease spread on local and regional spatial scales and have shown that host genotypes differ greatly in resistance. Comparable genetic variation in pathogen virulence has not yet been demonstrated. The genetic composition of host populations alters numerical dynamics in experimental populations: disease declines in resistant populations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13397471129921253573", "cites_id": ["13397471129921253573"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2265569", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xfCBgwJh7bkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 6, "1998": 7, "1999": 7, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
