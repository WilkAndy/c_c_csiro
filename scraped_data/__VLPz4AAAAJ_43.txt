We have investigated the regional population dynamics of the anther-smut Ustilago violacea, a pollinator-transmitted fungal disease, and its plant host Silene alba, using descriptive, experimental, and theoretical approaches. A 7-year survey of multiple natural populations revealed persistence of host and pathogen despite a high rate of population turnover. In an experimental metapopulation, disease spread was greater and more rapid in populations that were relatively isolated or had a previous history of disease occurrence. A computer simulation showed that spatial substructuring can drastically alter expectations based on analytical results from single population models of host\u2013pathogen systems. Moreover, the simulation reproduced many of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2353979764029503887", "cites_id": ["2353979764029503887"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b95-385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j7lvmx8EqyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 6, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 13, "2000": 9, "2001": 5, "2002": 9, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3}}
