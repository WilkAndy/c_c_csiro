In the case of random-contact ransmission, the probability of a healthy individual's becoming diseased is expected to be a function of the absolute density of diseased individuals (regardless of the number of healthy individuals), whereas in the case of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases, this probability is a function of the frequency (or relative density) of diseased individuals. Getz and Pickering (1983) showed that, in simple models of host-pathogen systems incorporating frequency-dependent transmission, pathogens \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8106609334704842907", "cites_id": ["8106609334704842907"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285554", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m6jyPz12gHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
