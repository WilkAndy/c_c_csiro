Patterns of disease incidence and prevalence were surveyed in three contrasting systems of natural L. alpina populations where there is substantial variation in spatial structure, ranging from large continuous populations through to small isolated patches. Disease incidence (fraction of populations where disease was present) was highest in the continuous situation, and lowest in the most isolated populations. The reverse was true for prevalence (fraction of individuals diseased). To better understand the long\u2010term ecological and evolutionary consequences of differences in among population spatial structure, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12135779595426041077", "cites_id": ["12135779595426041077"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970110.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9YzNcT7zaqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 16, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
