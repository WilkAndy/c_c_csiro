The latter suggests that, in nature, there will be a broad range of spatial scales over which hosts and pathogens interact (eg soil-borne pathogens to aerially dispersed rusts). Variation in the spatial scale of such interactions is likely to have consequences for disease dynamics and pathogen persistence, and therefore coevolution of host and pathogen. We investigated disease dynamics and persistence using a spatially explicit simulation model that incorporated local dispersal of host and pathogen approximating the range of spatial structures seen in nature (ie many small isolated populations with very local dispersal to single large populations with some substructuring with global dispersal). Our results show that the spatial scale of pathogen dispersal is an important factor in determining the probability of disease persistence, as well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1107981220146459549", "cites_id": ["1107981220146459549"], "pub_url": "http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v01/1040.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nTOipAxXYA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 8, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
