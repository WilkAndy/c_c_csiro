Re\u2010establishing cover with deep\u2010rooted perennial species is a major focus for conservation and sustainable land management, particularly with regard to hydrological control of recharge and saline discharge areas. However, considerable expense is involved in large\u2010scale revegetation programmes and cost effectiveness is a real concern.  2 Low\u2010cost revegetation approaches are needed that require little maintenance yet can substantially enhance reliable establishment and growth of native trees and shrubs. We evaluated results from direct\u2010seeding field trials that examined the benefits of using native Australian Acacia species inoculated with effective strains of nitrogen\u2010fixing root\u2010nodule bacteria to revegetate degraded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6491315635093608573", "cites_id": ["6491315635093608573"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01058.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fZixei3JFVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 9, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
