In general, genetic analysis of autotetraploid data is complicated by two main factors. The first is the existence of multiple heterozygous states: three partial heterozygotes (AAAB, AABB, AABC) and the full heterozygote (ABCD). In particular, estimation of expected heterozygosity (He) and the fixation coefficient (F) is burdensome under a tetraploid model, where even relatively low numbers of alleles at a locus can result in very large numbers of possible genotypic classes for which relative frequencies must be calculated based on population gene frequencies. A second problem for analysis of heterozygotes is that at meiosis, individual loci can undergo either random chromosomal segregation (RceS) or random chromatid segregation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16394098764363110210", "cites_id": ["16394098764363110210"], "pub_url": "https://cpbr.gov.au/cpbr/tools/autotet/autotet.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QpeIbveJg-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
