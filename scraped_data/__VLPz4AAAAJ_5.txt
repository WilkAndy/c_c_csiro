Parasite species exhibit a range of population structures and life-history strategies, including different transmission modes, life-cycle complexity, off-host survival mechanisms and dispersal ability. These are important determinants of the frequency and predictability of interactions with host species. Yet the complex causal relationships between spatial structure, life history and the evolutionary dynamics of parasite populations are not well understood. We demonstrate that a clear picture of the evolutionary potential of parasitic organisms and their demographic and evolutionary histories can only come from understanding the role of life history and spatial structure in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 373, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3358810841823656925", "cites_id": ["3358810841823656925"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534708002942", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3TuhNqrknC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 10, "2010": 23, "2011": 21, "2012": 19, "2013": 28, "2014": 25, "2015": 31, "2016": 38, "2017": 28, "2018": 32, "2019": 23, "2020": 31, "2021": 26, "2022": 27, "2023": 7}}
