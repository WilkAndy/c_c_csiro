Here, data are presented from a biologically realistic metapopulation model of gene\u2010for\u2010gene interactions that indicate that population level variation in resistance diversity will be negatively associated with disease prevalence (fraction of individuals infected). The model also predicts that disease incidence (presence/absence) will be positively related to total resistance diversity across the metapopulation, because high resistance diversity also selects for more virulent pathogens. These results are then contrasted with empirical data from a natural host\u2013pathogen system.
