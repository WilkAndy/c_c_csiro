Four models were tested; these assumed either linear density-dependent, linear frequency-dependent, exponential density-dependent, or exponential frequency-dependent disease transmission. Model parameters were estimated from an independent subset of experimental populations and from earlier field studies. 3 Susceptible and resistant populations had qualitatively different dynamics. Results from the experimental populations were consistent with model predictions that resistant populations would lose the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16360194136053526076", "cites_id": ["16360194136053526076"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2261264", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PC7m_-IVC-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 8, "1996": 6, "1997": 7, "1998": 6, "1999": 6, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
