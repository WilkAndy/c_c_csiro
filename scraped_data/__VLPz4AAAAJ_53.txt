Some time ago, Levin and Kerster (1975) showed that if individuals occupy positions on a spatial array, then the dynamics of selection can be greatly affected by seed-and pollen-dispersal distributions. Yet there have been few subsequent attempts to comprehensively\" test\" the robustness of population genetic theory in spatially extended populations. That this theory may be drastically changed is now being suggested by ecologically motivated studies. For example, Molofsky et al.(1997, in preparation) and Durrett and Levin (1997) have shown that some forms of positive frequency-dependent selection can maintain polymorphism in stochastic spatially distributed systems. This is not possible in single, unstructured populations. Similarly, the degree of spatial aggregation of individuals can greatly affect the conditions for coexistence under competition (Pacala 1986a; Kreitman, Shorrocks, and Dytham 1992). Therefore the outcomes of even quite simple types of interactions among species (qua genotypes) may be qualitatively different when considered in a spatial context.It is tempting for an ecologist to argue that\" genetics is only in the details\" and to subsume genetic variation as just another form of heterogeneity among the many inescapable and therefore perhaps ignorable complications of an already complex discipline. For example, at a recent symposium on disease in natural populations (Grenfell and Dobson 1995), there was a discussion section focused on the issue of\" Is genetics just another \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11242276601383321770", "cites_id": ["11242276601383321770"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QdqC8PvWB7AC&oi=fnd&pg=PA158&dq=info:qoAjPAGXBJwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=bMYvfgCdXd&sig=y3ncG8hfdoLQ-iMenyFPgO5m2nA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qoAjPAGXBJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
