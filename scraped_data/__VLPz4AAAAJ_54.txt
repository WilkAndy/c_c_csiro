The hosts of these pathogens include representatives from almost all major angiosperm orders. Despite their ecological and economic importance, the status of Puccinia and Uromyces as distinct genera has been disputed, and little is known about relationships within and among these groups. Here we present phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data from the translation elongation factor 1\u03b1 gene for over 60 species in the family Pucciniaceae. In particular, we investigate evolutionary relationships between Puccinia and Uromyces. A relatively smaller phylogeny using the beta-tubulin 1 gene was generated to test support for this phylogeny. Two main phylogenetic clades were identified and indicate at least two radiations within the Pucciniaceae.
