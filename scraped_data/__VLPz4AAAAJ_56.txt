However, the transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted and vector-borne diseases are likely to be frequency- rather than density-dependent, which results in qualitatively different dynamics. Here, we present analyses of a basic epidemiological model in which the transmission process is represented as a function of the population disease frequency. In an extension of the basic model, we consider disease transmission as a probability function that assumes that the chance of becoming infected increases with the number of vector contacts. Stability analyses show that host-pathogen coexistence is possible in vector-transmitted and sexually transmitted disease systems in which transmission is likely to be frequency-dependent; the potential for stable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14637351648805080224", "cites_id": ["14637351648805080224"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285727", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oEyBx8VRIssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 7, "1997": 4, "1998": 6, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 8, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
