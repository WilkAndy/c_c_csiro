The importance of plant-soil interactions in land reclamation, and the management and restoration of functioning native ecosystems, is becoming widely recognized. However, relatively little is known about broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in wild plant-soil symbiotic interactions. 2. The current study is part of a larger project examining patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in host and symbiont populations across their geographical ranges using two widespread native Australian Acacia spp. (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and associated populations of rhizobial bacteria. 3. A total of 58 sites were characterized with regard to symbiont population sizes, soil chemistry and environmental parameters. Rhizobial abundance was negatively correlated with a small number of soil factors, including nitrogen, and positively correlated with organic carbon and cation exchange capacity. 4.
