A new study has shown this to be true for one resistance gene in Arabidopsis. This raises intriguing theoretical and practical questions about how generally the results apply and how such costs are controlled in plants carrying resistance genes to several different pathogens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13155640944618025691", "cites_id": ["13155640944618025691"], "pub_url": "https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2003-4-9-227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:27KK0Lw5krYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
