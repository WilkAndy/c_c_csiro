The AFLPs consistently distinguished between the three species. AFLPs thus provide a reliable tool for identifying A. brassicicola. The analysis of eighteen isolates of A. brassicicola from different sites also indicated at least moderate levels of genetic diversity within A. brassicicola along the New South Wales coast. Of 43\u201366 markers scored per primer combination, 16.7\u201327.9% were polymorphic. On the basis of an unweighted paired group method of arithmetic averages analysis using data from four primer combinations, most isolates were identified as separate genotypes. However, multiple isolates from particular locations tended to cluster together, implying the potential for population \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13188091583330564146", "cites_id": ["13188091583330564146"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756208600659", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mri86WuDBbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 0, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
