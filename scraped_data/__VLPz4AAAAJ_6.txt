Across 54 studies, 94 traits have been examined in relation to abundance, distribution and threatened status at local, regional and geographical spatial scales. Most traits (63) have yet to be the focus of more than one study. Half of the studies involved less than 10 species, and one\u2010quarter did not replicate rare\u2013common contrasts. Although these features of the literature make it difficult to demonstrate robust generalizations regarding trait relationships with species rarity, some important findings surfaced in relation to traits that have been examined in two or more studies. Species with narrow geographical distributions were found to produce \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 344, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7843758466467713961", "cites_id": ["7843758466467713961"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01181.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qVPFacSg2mwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 8, "2005": 13, "2006": 15, "2007": 20, "2008": 13, "2009": 12, "2010": 23, "2011": 17, "2012": 17, "2013": 20, "2014": 21, "2015": 12, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 18, "2019": 12, "2020": 19, "2021": 39, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
