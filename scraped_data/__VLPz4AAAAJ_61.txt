These range from single populations dominated by demographic and genetic stochasticity, to metapopulations in which colonisation/extinction dynamics have a large influence, and larger geographic regions where phylogenetic patterns and historical events become important. We present data for the genetically and demographically well-characterised plant host\u2013pathogen interaction, the Linum marginale\u2013Melampsora lini system, and use this to demonstrate the varying nature of resistance and virulence structure across these spatial scales. At the within population level, our results indicate considerable variability in resistance and virulence, but little evidence of coordinated changes in host and pathogen. Studies involving comparisons among multiple demes within a single metapopulation show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11538999142165551553", "cites_id": ["11538999142165551553"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011042721274", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wZlQZJXCIqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 11, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
