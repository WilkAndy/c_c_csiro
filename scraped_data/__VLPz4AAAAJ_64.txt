Agriculture has been a crucible of evolutionary change ever since its inception thousands of years ago, and this change permeates agricultural endeavours at all levels of biological organisation, ranging from the individual gene through to whole communities. Agro-ecosystems thus provide one of the most cogent examples of situations where anthropogenic effects are major determinants of biotic interactions within and among species and communities, suggesting a central role for the application of evolutionary principles. This is particularly the case, given global concerns regarding food production and food security, and increasingly, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14618732272980030925", "cites_id": ["14618732272980030925"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352499/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zXWDhYwr4MoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 1}}
