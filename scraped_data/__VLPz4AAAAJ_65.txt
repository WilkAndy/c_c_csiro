Legumes (Fabaceae) are a diverse and widely distributed plant family largely dependent on symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, which are acquired from soil after germination. This dependency is predicted to limit establishment in new geographic areas, owing to a disruption of compatible host-symbiont associations. Here we compare non-native establishment patterns of symbiotic and non-symbiotic legumes across over 3,500 species, covering multiple independent gains and losses of rhizobial symbiosis. We find that symbiotic legume species have spread to fewer non-native regions compared to non-symbiotic legumes, providing strong support for the hypothesis that lack of suitable symbionts or environmental conditions required for effective nitrogen-fixation are driving these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16930415485871088793", "cites_id": ["16930415485871088793"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14790", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mWQe5y7r9OoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
