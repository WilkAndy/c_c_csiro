Many of these parasites are acquired through contact with infectious stages present in soil, feces or vegetation, suggesting that ranging behavior will have a major impact on their spread. We developed an individual-based spatial simulation model to investigate how range use intensity, home range overlap, and defecation rate impact the spread of fecally transmitted parasites in a population composed of social groups (i.e., a socially structured population). We also investigated the effects of epidemiological parameters involving host and parasite mortality rates, transmissibility, disease\u2013related mortality, and group size. The model was spatially explicit and involved the spillover of a gastrointestinal parasite from a reservoir population along the edge of a simulated reserve, which was designed to mimic the introduction pathogens into protected areas. Animals ranged randomly within a \u201ccore\u201d area, with biased movement toward the range center when outside the core. We systematically varied model parameters using a Latin hypercube sampling design. Analyses of simulation output revealed a strong positive association between range use intensity and the prevalence of infection. Moreover, the effects of range use intensity were similar in magnitude to effects of group size, mortality rates, and the per-contact probability of transmission. Defecation rate covaried positively with gastrointestinal parasite prevalence. Greater home range overlap had no positive effects on prevalence, with a smaller core resulting in less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3316056967651819676", "cites_id": ["3316056967651819676"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nIDYKz4ABS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
