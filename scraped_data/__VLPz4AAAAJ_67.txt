We found no evidence of a collector bias against diseased specimens. Diseased specimens were frequently found in collections of S. virginica and S. caroliniana, but not in those of S. rotundifolia or S. latifolia. Disease incidence in S. virginica and S. caroliniana increased significantly over the past century and was higher in marginal populations. The absence of disease in specimens of S. rotundifolia is consistent with field observations, but its presence in natural populations of S. latifolia (especially in Virginia) suggests that the disease is recently introduced. Changes in the host distributions were also evident. The relative abundance of S. caroliniana declined over time (especially further north), while the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4927257161569016535", "cites_id": ["4927257161569016535"], "pub_url": "https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.90.10.1522", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1xpSYEgiYUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 12, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
