The transmission rate of this disease therefore depends on spore deposition by the vector species and preferences for infected vs. healthy hosts. We observed natural populations of S. alba to document the most abundant insect visitors, which include syrphid flies, andrenid bees, bumblebees and a variety of nocturnal moths. Using bumblebees and moths in flower preference studies, we showed that bumblebees preferentially visited healthy flowers, but the strength of this preference declined if the bees had prior exposure to diseased flowers. Nocturnal moths showed less discrimination with respect to disease status when plants were arranged in a field population of S. alba, and preferentially visited plants with more flowers.
