One of the most pressing challenges in agriculture is how to ensure food security and promote long-term social-economic development while maintaining healthy, sustainable ecosystems capable of quickly adapting to changing environments. Previous studies demonstrated the positive impact of mixed planting strategies on crop productivity as a consequence of reduced disease impact. Here we present data from a series of trials involving within-species diversification of potatoes grown under smallholding conditions, showing that the benefits of mixed planting strategies extend beyond increases in yield, production resilience and reductions in disease, to increased soil microbial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3552099675773847343", "cites_id": ["3552099675773847343"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0201-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L8dH1dWXSzEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 15, "2021": 25, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
