Many studies have addressed various aspects of the ways in which hosts and their pathogens interact but have tended to focus on individual populations, on comparisons made at single points in time, or on broader comparisons that confound patterns from different epidemiological and evolutionary units. While such studies provide valuable information, their essentially \u2018static\u2019 snap-shot nature limits the ability to interpret the nature of the underpinning coevolutionary processes. An increasing number of long-term studies involving repeat sampling of multiple interaction demes distributed across space are giving insight into the complexity of the numerical and genetic dynamics of host \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18342439722878639756", "cites_id": ["18342439722878639756"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10658-013-0265-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jB4y3L5vjf4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
