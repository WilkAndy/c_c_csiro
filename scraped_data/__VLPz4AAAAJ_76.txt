This hypothesis was tested both in field experiments and under controlled-environment conditions. The effect of soil nutrient levels on the population dynamics was observed in glasshouse experiments. (2) Seed-set-density relations have negative slopes for a wide range of plant densities, both in the field and under controlled conditions, indicating that oscillatory dynamics are possible. The negative slope occurs because the fecundity of an Abutilon individual is not directly proportional to its biomass but is actually proportional to its biomass minus a constant. Field populations are in a state of damped rather than persistent oscillations solely due to the effect of delayed germination of seeds.
