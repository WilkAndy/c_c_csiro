The complexity of potential interactions among rhizobia and plants complicates the development of general predictions regarding causal relationships between rhizobial diversity and plant productivity. For example, while rhizobial complementarity may result in positive associations between symbiont diversity and plant productivity, antagonistic competition may reduce rhizobial community function. Using two widespread native Australian Acacia species (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and experimental rhizobial communities derived from 16 bacterial genotypes naturally associated with these hosts, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6869317269564376230", "cites_id": ["6869317269564376230"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.12336", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pkTXVam3VF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 17, "2021": 4}}
