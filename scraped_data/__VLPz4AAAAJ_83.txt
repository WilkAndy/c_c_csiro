We develop general models of annual hosts and soil-borne fungal pathogens to explore the conditions for host-pathogen coexistence in both agricultural and natural plant populations. We use empirical data from the literature to parameterize and simulate dynamics with these models. 2 Initially we consider a simple system in which host density is assumed to be constant, as would be appropriate for agricultural systems. Model analysis shows that initial increase of the pathogen population requires that host (crop) density be above a threshold; this threshold decreases with increases in the pathogen's over-winter survival rate and ability to grow saprophytically. 3 A more complex model, in which both host and pathogen populations can vary, is needed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18376376445671847164", "cites_id": ["18376376445671847164"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2960504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_DQg3wMBBv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 3}}
