Of ten pair-wise population comparisons, six had no pathogen genotypes in common; only one genotype occurred five times, and most (93%) were found only once. Although an UPGMA based on Nei's measure of genetic distance separated the five populations, a cluster analysis using individual isolates failed to group them according to population, indicating significant gene flow. An analysis of molecular variance indicated ca 14% of the variation occurred between populations, representing moderate population differentiation over the spatial scale of the study. Tests of the relative contribution of clonality and sexual recombination indicated low, albeit significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2474398831926418715", "cites_id": ["2474398831926418715"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mycological-research/article/genetic-structure-of-populations-of-alternaria-brassicicola-suggests-the-occurrence-of-sexual-recombination/EB6925C6F61FA22CC2AC047E5450318E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G52dsaDUViIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 7, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
