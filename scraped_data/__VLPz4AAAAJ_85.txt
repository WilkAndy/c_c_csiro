We assessed the role of the soil microbial community (with an emphasis on symbiotic nitrogen\u2010fixing bacteria, collectively termed rhizobia) in determining cross\u2010continental invasion success of five woody legume species.Australia.For each species, we compared growth of plants in soils from their native and non\u2010native ranges using a glasshouse study, a soil dilution method (most probable number) and T\u2010RFLP to assess rhizobial abundance and community composition, respectively.Acacia longifolia was the only species that had significantly larger above\u2010ground biomass when grown in soils from its non\u2010native range. Rhizobial abundance was equally high across species and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16157519530930882790", "cites_id": ["16157519530930882790"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00920.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5kiSPGgKO-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
