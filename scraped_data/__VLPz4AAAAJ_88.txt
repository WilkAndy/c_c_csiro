Almost 400 Acacia species have been introduced outside their native ranges in Australia; approximately 6% have become invasive, 12% are naturalized, and 82% have no record of naturalization or invasion. This variation in invasiveness provides a comparative framework in which to examine mechanisms that either promote or constrain establishment and colonization of species in novel regions. Here, we experimentally examine the role that the legume\u2013rhizobia symbiosis plays in the differential invasiveness of acacias introduced outside their native Australian ranges.Canberra, Australia.We paired 12 Acacia species ranging in invasiveness globally with 12 rhizobial strains ranging in average symbiotic effectiveness. We measured plant growth and nodulation success and abundance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15012551733268219920", "cites_id": ["15012551733268219920"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12363", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EIig8UJMV9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
