We investigate the evolution of transmission mode as a function of host social and mating structure using a model in which disease transmission is explicitly dependent on the numbers of sexual and nonsexual contacts (which are themselves a function of population density) and per\u2010contact infection probabilities. Most generally, and in the absence of trade\u2010offs between the degree of sexual transmission and effects on host fecundity and mortality, nonsexual transmission is favored above the social\u2010sexual crossover point (the host density at which the number of nonsexual contacts exceeds the number of sexual contacts), while sexual transmission is favored below this point. When changes in allocation to the two transmission modes are accompanied by changes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16958536701080703855", "cites_id": ["16958536701080703855"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/286100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bxNXikfTWOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 7, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
