At all these levels their impact varies from the subtle and little recognized through to the most obvious destruction. Today the direct role of pathogens in natural plant communities is better recognized than at previous times, although the nuances of their interactions and the cascade of ramifications that can flow through changing biotic and abiotic effects are only now gaining recognition. However, as human influence on pathogens increases\u2014either directly through enhanced if accidental dispersal, or through anthropogenic impacts on climate\u2014we may expect to see increasing evidence of pathogens affecting plant species, community structure, and ecosystem function."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 304, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12098200234811107464", "cites_id": ["12098200234811107464"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.phyto.43.040204.140238", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iKh2uQNx5acJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 14, "2008": 23, "2009": 18, "2010": 22, "2011": 28, "2012": 22, "2013": 21, "2014": 27, "2015": 12, "2016": 16, "2017": 20, "2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 21, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
