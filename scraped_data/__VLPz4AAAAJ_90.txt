We use differential equation models of single populations to derive conditions under which a genetic variant with one (e.g. sexual) transmission mode can invade and successfully displace a genetic variant with a different (e.g. non\u2013sexual) transmission mode. Invasion by an STD is easier if the equilibrium population size in the presence of an OID is smaller; conversely an OID can invade more easily if the equilibrium size of the population with the STD is larger. Invasion of an STD does not depend on the degree of sterility caused by the infection, but does depend on the added mortality caused by a resident OID. In contrast, the ability of an OID to invade a population at equilibrium with an STD decreases as the degree of sterility caused by the STD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15794736936299728356", "cites_id": ["15794736936299728356"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.1997.0083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5A3jOI8tMtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
