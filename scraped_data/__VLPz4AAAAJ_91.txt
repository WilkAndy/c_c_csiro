For microbes that are plant symbionts, community assembly processes can lead to either a positive or negative relationship between plant size or age and soil microbe diversity. Here, we evaluated the extent to which such relationships exist within a single legume species (Acacia acuminata) and their naturally occurring symbiotic nitrogen\u2010fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata trees of variable size spanning a large environmental gradient in southwest Australia (72 trees in 24 sites spread across ~300,000 km2), using metabarcoding. We modelled rhizobia diversity using 16S exact genetic variants, in a binomial multivariate statistical framework that controlled for climate and local soil characteristics. We identified two major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16390450309621782308", "cites_id": ["16390450309621782308"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.13083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JJeyXbeTduMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 16, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
