Several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolutionary potential of pathogens and thus increase resistance durability. These strategies can be classified into four categories, depending on whether resistance sources are varied across time (rotations) or combined in space in the same cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within a field (cultivar mixtures) or among fields (mosaics). Despite their potential to differentially affect both pathogen epidemiology and evolution, to date the four categories of deployment strategies have never been directly compared together within a single theoretical or experimental framework, with regard to efficiency (ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9286828247288774017", "cites_id": ["9286828247288774017"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12681", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gf21URZx4YAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 11}}
