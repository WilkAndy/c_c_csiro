Here we investigate the population genetic structure of wild populations of the plant pathogen Melampsora lini on its host Linum marginale, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, two genes underlying pathogen virulence, and phenotypic variation in virulence. In Australia, M. lini occurs as two genetically and geographically divergent lineages (AA and AB), one of which is completely asexual (AB), and the other able to reproduce both clonally and sexually (AA). To quantify the genetic and evolutionary consequences of these different life histories, we sampled five populations in each of two biogeographical regions. Analysis of AFLP data obtained for 275 isolates revealed largely disjunct \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11541032636950419554", "cites_id": ["11541032636950419554"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03843.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YpieSgn8KaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
