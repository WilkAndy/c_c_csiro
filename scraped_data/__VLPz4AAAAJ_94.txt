Fungal isolates from the two host species showed fixed differences at allozyme loci, and isolates from S. alba were similar to isolates from S. alba in Europe. Fungal isolates from S. virginica did not produce disease on S. alba; crosses between fungal isolates from the two hosts showed reduced inoculation success on S. alba. Teliospores from hybrids between the isolates showed abnormal sporidial development. We conclude that the two anthersmuts from each of the host species are genetically distinct and partially reproductively isolated \"host-races.\" Ustilago violacea occurs on S. virginica throughout its range, and far beyond the range of diseased S. alba.
