This study used microsatellite markers in the interaction between Cakile maritima and the fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola to explore genetic expectations associated with such situations. The host, C. maritima, was introduced into Australia approximately 100 years ago, but it is unknown whether the pathogen was already present in Australia, as it has a wide occurrence, or whether it was introduced to Australia on brassicaceous hosts. Eleven A. brassicicola populations were studied, and all showed moderate levels of gene and genotypic diversity. Chi-square tests of the frequencies of mating type alleles, a large number of genotypes, and linkage equilibrium among microsatellite loci \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13310002137251086240", "cites_id": ["13310002137251086240"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.01594-09", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oH-KpmygtrgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
