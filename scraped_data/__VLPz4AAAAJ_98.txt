The bias was usually to mating type A1, but the frequency of bias and its spatial distribution varied from region to region. Populations with high frequencies of bias still showed high rates of disease transmission. Crosses between A1 mating type sporidial lines from completely biased individuals and A2 mating types from unbiased individuals showed no bias in the progeny. During teliospore germination, biased individuals often showed conjugation among adjacent cells of the promycelium, suggesting that both mating types are present in the germinating teliospore but one mating type is unable to grow as free-living \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2637102586189102031", "cites_id": ["2637102586189102031"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00275514.1998.12026921", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z7sQhtTemCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
