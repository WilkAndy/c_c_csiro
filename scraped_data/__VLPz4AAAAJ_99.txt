However, the potential consequences for crop diseases of the composition, the spatial configuration and the persistence time of the agro\u2010ecological interface \u2013 the area where crops and remnant vegetation are in contact \u2013 have been poorly studied. Here, we develop a demographic\u2013genetic simulation model to study how the spatial and temporal distribution of remnant wild vegetation patches embedded in an agricultural landscape can drive the emergence of a crop pathogen and its subsequent specialization on the crop host. We found that landscape structures that promoted larger pathogen populations on the wild host facilitated the emergence of a crop pathogen, but such landscape structures also reduced the potential for the pathogen population to adapt to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "__VLPz4AAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17526741673915058618", "cites_id": ["17526741673915058618"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eva.12251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ugm-F7F-O_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 11, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
