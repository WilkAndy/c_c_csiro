These phenomena have two major biological implications: first, many wildlife species are reservoirs of pathogens that threaten domestic animal and human health; second, wildlife EIDs pose a substantial threat to the conservation of global biodiversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 4962, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13324090529278115515", "cites_id": ["13324090529278115515"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.287.5452.443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u77ECL6t6LgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 22, "2001": 52, "2002": 62, "2003": 90, "2004": 107, "2005": 118, "2006": 156, "2007": 160, "2008": 181, "2009": 175, "2010": 215, "2011": 220, "2012": 273, "2013": 296, "2014": 263, "2015": 280, "2016": 300, "2017": 284, "2018": 283, "2019": 277, "2020": 331, "2021": 356, "2022": 276, "2023": 112}}
