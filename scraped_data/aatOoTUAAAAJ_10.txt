Design A pathological survey and a transmission experiment were conducted. Procedure Diagnostic pathology examinations were performed on free\u2010living and captive, ill and dead amphibians collected opportunistically from eastern Australia between October 1993 and December 2000. We conducted a transmission experiment in the laboratory to investigate the effects of temperature: eight great barred frogs (Mixophyes fasciolatus) exposed to zoospores of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and six unexposed frogs were housed individually in each of three rooms held at 17\u00b0C, 23\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. Results Chytridiomycosis was the cause of death or morbidity for 133 (55.2%) of 241 free\u2010living amphibians and for 66 (58.4%) of 113 captive amphibians.
