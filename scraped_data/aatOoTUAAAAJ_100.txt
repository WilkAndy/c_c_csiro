Several assays such as immunoperoxidase, immunoelectron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid sequencing, as well as phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences, were performed on infected fish tissues. Immunohistochemistry results suggested the presence of related antigenic determinants between the Tasmanian RLO and the type strain LF-89 of Piscirickettsia salmonis. However, sequence alignment demonstrated that the Tasmanian RLO contains a 19 bp deletion at the 3\u2019-end of the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA operon, indicating a genetic divergence from P. salmonis isolates, which are exotic to Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2631142142859346031", "cites_id": ["2631142142859346031"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v64/n1/p37-44/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bwCxqtaxgyQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2}}
