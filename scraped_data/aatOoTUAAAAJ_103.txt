Virus\u2010infected cells grown on carbon\u2010Parlodion\u2010coated electron microscope grids release large numbers of progeny viruses which adsorb to the surface of the grid and are revealed by negative staining. The technique is rapid, sensitive and can be used at three levels. (1) Negative staining of whole cell preparations revealed both extracellular and intracellular viruses or nucleocapsids beneath the plasma membrane; (2) non\u2010ionic detergent extraction of cells infected with certain viruses reveals cytoskeleton\u2010associated, virus\u2010specific structures normally only observed after thin sectioning; (3) cultures prepared by either procedure are suitable for colloidal gold immunological studies. Extracellular and cytoskeletal\u2010associated viruses were heavily and specifically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16345619167219082688", "cites_id": ["16345619167219082688"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2818.1987.tb01319.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wOXonwdO1-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 4, "1989": 7, "1990": 4, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
