When the N-terminal 30 amino acid residues of VP60 were deleted and substituted by a well characterized six residue epitope from bluetongue virus capsid protein VP7 (Btag), the fusion protein retained its ability to self-assemble into VLPs. However, the size of these particles was only 27\u2009nm, compared to 40\u2009nm of VLPs derived from native VP60. The antigenicity of both VP60 and the Btag was retained as evident from ELISA and Western blot analyses. When Btag was fused at the C-terminus of VP60 without deletion, the fusion proteins formed VLPs of 40\u2009nm in size and also retained their antigenicity, but the Btag antigenicity appeared weak at this fusion site."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10476692622998532692", "cites_id": ["10476692622998532692"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007050050655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VHLIxm6wZJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
