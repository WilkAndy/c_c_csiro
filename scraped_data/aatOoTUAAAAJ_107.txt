PCR primers were synthesised which spanned an open reading frame. After 30 cycles of amplification of EHNV and Bohle lridovirus (BIV) genomic DNA, PCR PI-oducts from the primers (P505 and P506) were visible on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. No PCR products were obtained from diamond python erythrocytic iridovirus (DPEV) or fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV) DNA. EHNV isolates from redfin perch Perca fluviatilis L., rainbow trout Oncorhynchus rnyluss Walbaum and BIV isolates from the ornate burrowing frog Lijnnodynastes ornatus Gray and barramundi Lates calcarifer generated PCR products of 235 bp. The tests were used to amplify DNA extracted from EHNV-infected ce1. l cultures and infected tissues from redfin perch, rainbow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4303913889343421318", "cites_id": ["4303913889343421318"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v22/n3/p211-215/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hjsvFuGSujsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
