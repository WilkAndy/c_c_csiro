Comparison of the RNA 2 sequence of four variants with that of the wild-type virus indicated that each variant contained a single nucleotide substitution which in turn resulted in a single amino acid alteration in VP2. The changes were clustered within a span of eight amino acids at positions 328 to 335 in the VP2 protein. In addition, analyses of cells infected with wild-type and a variant virus V35B2 have provided information on the site of VP2 addition to virus particles during morphogenesis. Electron microscopic examination revealed few virus-like particles around virus inclusion bodies (VIB) in wild-type virus-infected cells and cytoskeletons. In contrast, VIB in cells infected with the neutralization-resistant variant V35B2 were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9718277312786871899", "cites_id": ["9718277312786871899"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268228890654X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WzZm8blB3oYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 9, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
