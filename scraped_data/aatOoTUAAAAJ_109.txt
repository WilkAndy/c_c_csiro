Nipah virus infection is associated with a case-fatality ratio of 40% to 76% in humans (1, 2). Cats (Felis catus) were infected with NiV at the site of the outbreak in northern Malaysia (3). Experimental studies have shown that cats are susceptible to Hendra virus and NiV (4, 5). Infected cats shed NiV through the nasopharynx and in urine while viremic, and 1 (of 2) recovered from experimental NiV infection with a high neutralizing antibody titer (> 256) within 21 days (5). Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are believed to be the reservoir for NiV in Malaysia (6). In June 2000, NiV was isolated from partially eaten fruit and from the urine of Pteropus hypomelanus in the village of Air Batang on Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia (7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16899178771360120624", "cites_id": ["16899178771360120624"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291044/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MP-9jo7xheoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
