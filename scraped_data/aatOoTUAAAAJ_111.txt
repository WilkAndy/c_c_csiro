Haemolymph osmotic pressure. Na+ and K+ corcentrations were regulated within narrow limits (O.P. 413\u2013459 mOs/Kg; Na+ 185 \u2013 210 mM; K+ 16.0\u201319.5 mM). Rehydration of dehydrated insects restored the haemolymph osmalality and Na+ and K+ concentrations to near original levels within 24 hr. During dehydration 1219 \u03bcg Na+ (expressed as NaCl) and 158 \u03bcg K+ (expressed as KCl) were removed from the haemolymph. Only 4% (approximately) of these amounts were excreted. Na+ and K+ ingestion and excretion being virtually in balance. The Na+ and K+ removed from the blood was entirely accounted for by the observed increase in Na+ and K+ concentrations in the fat body (Na+ 11.02\u201318.10 mg/g: K+ 31.85\u201343.78 mg/g expressed as chlorides during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5884351143163874489", "cites_id": ["5884351143163874489"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002219107790169X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uUzyJTBqqVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 5, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
