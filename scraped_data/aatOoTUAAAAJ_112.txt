In this chapter, using the zoonotic agents Hendra virus and Nipah virus as examples, the pathogenesis of infection in various species including the wildlife reservoirs and domestic spillover hosts is reviewed with an emphasis on the aspects of pathogenesis which contribute to the dissemination of infection. Through these discussions, the emergence of these zoonotic agents is explored."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7190029822033361236", "cites_id": ["7190029822033361236"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70962-6_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VHnDWgceyGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
