Although the virus infects both sheep and cattle, disease has mainly been confined to sheep in North America, South Africa, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. Other regions of the world including Indonesia, Australia and Japan do not observe clinical disease although the presence of BTV has been confirmed by serology and virus isolation. Eight serotypes of BTV have been isolated in Australia and until recently these have not been associated with disease in the field. This paper describes progress in rapid methods of bluetongue diagnosis which were utilised in identifying a virulent bluetongue virus isolated from a clinical case in the Northern Territory of Australia (Melville, personal communication). BTV has a segmented genome composed of 10 segments of double stranded RNA, each of which encodes a unique protein. The genome is surrounded by a double-shelled capsid the outer layer of which comprises 2 proteins, designated VP2 (the serotype specific protein) and VP5. The inner core of the virus is icosahedral and contains 2 major group-specific proteins, VP3 and VP7, as well as 3 minor proteins VPl, VP4 and VP6. Apart from the 7 structural proteins 3 non-structural proteins (NSl, NS2 and NS3) are also encoded by the viral genome (Sangar and Mertens 1983; Huismans and Erasmus 1981; Verwoerd zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfed et a1 1972).Recent studies have generated data on both the distribution of proteins in virus particles (Hyatt and Eaton 1988) and infected cells (Eaton et zyxwvutsrqponmlkjih a1 1987 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3218083231550861676", "cites_id": ["3218083231550861676"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/48069797/Current_techniques_in_rapid_bluetongue_v20160815-20732-653cqq.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bPE6IqbtqCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 6, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
