The reintroduction involved the release of approximately 5000 captive-bred tadpoles and subsequent monitoring. Before the reintroduction could take place several requirements had to be satisfied. A re-introduction proposal was prepared for the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) and independently reviewed by two referees, pre-release surveys of frogs were undertaken to determine if L. aurea existed on the site and to ascertain if the pathogen Bactrachochytrium dendrobatiodis (chytrid) was present within the endemic frog population. The captive bred tadpoles were tested for the presence of chytrid prior to release. The water quality was tested at the proposed release site and potential predators were removed.
