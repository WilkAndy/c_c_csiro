This virus was identified as a serotype of epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) of deer virus previously undescribed in Australia. An additional 17 isolations of this virus were made from eight animals during the period February to May. Electron microscopic studies showed the presence of orbivirus-like structures. Serogrouping ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence assay and the serogrouping plaque reduction neutralisation test indicated the virus was a member of the epizootic haemorrhagic disease serogroup. Serotype specific plaque reduction neutralisation tests, indicated the virus was a member of the epizootic haemorrhagic disease serogroup not previously isolated in Australia.
