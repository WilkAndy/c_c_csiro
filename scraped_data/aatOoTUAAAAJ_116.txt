Antibodies to the virus and to associated capsid subunits have been produced and used in immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron\u2010microscopy and an antigcn\u2010capture\u2010immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results show that both antibodies can be used by various immuno\u2010procedures to detect both redfin perch, Perca ftuviatilis L., and rainbow trout isolates of EHNV. The procedures described provide for the first time rapid and specific tests for the detection of EHNV in cultured and clinical material."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4762826391496912413", "cites_id": ["4762826391496912413"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2761.1991.tb00619.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HW4HWF71GEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
