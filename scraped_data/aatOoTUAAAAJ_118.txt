Procedure A sample of fourteen uncooked prawns was obtained from a consignment imported from southeast Asia. Each of the prawns was examined for WSSV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then a bioassay was conducted in which a 10% homogenate of cuticular epithelium from each of the prawns was inoculated intramuscularly into healthy challenge prawns (Penaeus monodon) from Australia. The latter were then monitored for clinical signs of disease, and tissue samples were processed for electron microscopy, histological examination and for detection of WSSV by in situ hybridization (ISH) using a commercial kit. Limited numbers of haemolymph samples from inoculated challenge prawns were also examined by PCR for the presence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17388264259890715347", "cites_id": ["17388264259890715347"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2004.tb14647.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0xpopzeGT_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
