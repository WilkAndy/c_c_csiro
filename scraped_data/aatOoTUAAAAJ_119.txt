The family Chlamydiaceae is gaining attention as a common cause of disease in amphibians and may harbour new and emerging amphibian pathogens. We identified a novel species of Chlamydiales (Candidatus Amphibiichlamydia ranarum) with a prevalence of 71% in exotic invasive bullfrog tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) from an introduced population in the Netherlands. The sequence of a 1474\u2003bp 16S rRNA gene fragment showed that the novel taxon forms a well\u2010defined clade with \u2018Candidatus Amphibiichlamydia salamandrae\u2019 within the Chlamydiaceae family. Although none of the tadpoles examined showed signs of clinical disease, urgent evaluation of its pathogenic potential for native amphibian species is required."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8832153788585123269", "cites_id": ["8832153788585123269"], "pub_url": "https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-2229.2012.00359.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xZ08chMdknoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
