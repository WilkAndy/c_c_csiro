Several causes have been proposed, but the recently described chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Longcore and otbers 1999) is held responsible for several cases of massive deaths of amphibians, mainly in pristine rainforest habitats in Australia and Soutb America, but also in Europe and North America (Berger and others 1998, Mutschmann and others 2000, Bosch and others 2001). The disease caused by this fungus is called chytridiomycosis and an up-to-date overview of species affected by this disease is provided by Speare and Berger (2000). Reports of chytridiomycosis almost always concern anuran species, only incidental reports on urodelan casualties exist, involving mainly North American urodelans (the genera Ambystoma, Amphiuma, Necturus and Siren) and one European species (Salamandra salamandra)(Speare and Berger 2000).This short communication documents tbe diagnosis of chytridiomycosis in a Central American plethodontid salamander, Bolitoglossus dofleini. This salamander species inhabits Central American lowland forest and is imported occasionally to Europe for the pet trade. It is generally considered notoriously difficuit to keep alive; most imported animals do not survive beyond the first two months after importation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16098095648594449823", "cites_id": ["16098095648594449823"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peernel-Zwart/publication/8580394_Chytridiomycosis_in_the_Central_American_bolitoglossine_salamander_Bolitoglossa_dofleini/links/559ede6b08aeb40ee93c2846/Chytridiomycosis-in-the-Central-American-bolitoglossine-salamander-Bolitoglossa-dofleini", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n9W7drPsZ98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
