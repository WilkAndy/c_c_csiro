A single uninoculated animal served as a control. Animals were monitored weekly under anaesthesia, examined ophthalmoscopically (including fundic photography), and samples collected for haematological and serum biochemical analysis, virus isolation, PCR and serological examination for antibodies against Wallal and Warrego viruses. Animals inoculated with cultured Wallal virus were killed at week 10, and remaining kangaroos were reinoculated with cultured Wallal virus at week 12.Results \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9903698493715918627", "cites_id": ["9903698493715918627"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1999.tb12125.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Iy-C2E4BcYkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
