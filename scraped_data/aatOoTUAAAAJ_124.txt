Assembly of new virus particles occurs within the perinuclear viroplasm bodies known as virus factories. Two types of virus particle are routinely observed: \u201cfulls,\u201d which are particles with an electron-dense DNA-containing nucleoid, and \u201cempties,\u201d which consist of the virus protein and membrane icosahedral shell but are without the incorporation of the virus genome. The objective of this study was to understand ASFV morphogenesis by determining the distribution of intracellular viral DNA in the virus factory and during virus particle assembly. The ultrastructural localisation of DNA within ASFV-infected cells was achieved using two complementary methods: with an ASFV-specific DNA probe to the major capsid protein (p73) gene (B646L) hybridisedin situor through detection \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13965692282866456124", "cites_id": ["13965692282866456124"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298993084", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PFarSiMb0MEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
