The Chytridiomycota can be preserved with varying degrees of success using a number of different protocols including cryopreservation. The survival of fungi in the Chytridiomycota is sensitive to environmental factors such as lack of moisture, high temperatures, high osmotic potential, and availability of oxygen, all of which must be considered in designing preservation methods. The age of the culture at the initiation of preservation appears to be a particularly important determinant of viability. Recently, commonly used methods for preservation of other groups of fungi have been modified to improve the survival of the Chytridiomycota in culture collections. High rates of survival have been reported after cryopreservation of aerobic and anaerobic chytrids in 10 % glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13602228191498714809", "cites_id": ["13602228191498714809"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095375620600308X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ub4V9HjSxLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
