Certification of freedom from infection, prevalence surveys, surveillance and routine diagnosis are hampered by lack of a validated rapid molecular test. In this study, a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection of the major capsid protein gene of ranaviruses was developed and validated using Epizootic Haematopoietic Necrosis Virus (EHNV) as a model ranavirus. The assay had 100-fold greater analytical sensitivity compared to virus isolation in Bluegill fry (BF-2) cells, detected all viruses in a panel of 20 ranaviruses from Australia, America, Europe and the United Kingdom, did not detect two disputed members of the genus Ranavirus (doctorfish virus and guppy virus 6) and did not detect a megalocytivirus or two cyprinid herpesviruses.
