A protocol is described that enables the extraction and amplification of dsDNA from fixed tissues within paraffin blocks and from specimens stored in 10%(aq) formalin. The procedure can be used for the examination of ranavirus DNA within archival tissues thereby providing valuable data for identifying the origin and tracing the spread of ranaviruses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=618907809164523305", "cites_id": ["618907809164523305"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v39/n2/p151-154/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KXf3kV_NlggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
