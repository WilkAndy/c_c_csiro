To achieve cell surface localization, VP2 was expressed as a hybrid protein with signal sequence and membrane anchors of influenza virus hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. Native VP2 was expressed as VP2 alone or as self-processing VP2-VP4-VP3 polyprotein for coexpression of IBDV structural proteins. VP2 hybrid protein containing the carboxy-terminal membrane anchor sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin was located on the cell surface and was N-glycosylated. The expression of VP2 fused to the N-terminal signal/anchor sequence of influenza virus neuraminidase led to cell lysis and the VP2 protein remained mainly unglycosylated. Cell surface localization of VP2 reduced immunogenicity (antibody induction) and abolished protection in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11684212205583842548", "cites_id": ["11684212205583842548"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170294900809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9LwbahipJqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1}}
