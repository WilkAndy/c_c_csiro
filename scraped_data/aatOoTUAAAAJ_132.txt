It is shown by X-ray micro-analysis that the average composition of the luminal fluid of secretory tubules in duckling salt glands is Na 80 mmol l\u22121, Cl. 100 mmol l\u22121, K 40 mmol l\u22121, Mg 11 mmol l\u22121, Ca 6 mmol l\u22121. It is assumed that the anion deficit is accounted for by HCO                   3 \u2212                 . This fluid is approximately isosmotic or slightly hyposmotic to blood. There were no significant differences between the composition in different regions of the tubule nor between active and inactive glands. The fluid becomes increasingly hyperosmotic in the duct system, most concentration apparently occurring in the main ducts running from gland to external nares. Modification of the primary hyposmotic or isosmotic secretion therefore appears to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5215293418499650090", "cites_id": ["5215293418499650090"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00695776", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KrIaebtxYEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
