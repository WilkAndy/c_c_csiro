B. dendrobatidis is found only in the keratinised tissues, which include the mouthparts of healthy tadpoles. The epidermis of infected post-metamorphic frogs is thickened (hyperkeratosis) and the superficial layer can sometimes slough. Diagnosis is most commonly performed on stained sections of toe clips or ventral skin. Accurate interpretation can be difficult and requires a high level of expertise, particularly in infected animals exhibiting hyperkeratosis with sloughing. Misdiagnosis can occur when zoosporangia of B. dendrobatidis are shed with the superficial keratin layers. We have developed a staining protocol based on previously described methods to detect both B. dendrobatidis and keratin, to improve the sensitivity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12288314539014605728", "cites_id": ["12288314539014605728"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v61/n1-2/p85-88/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oMs7ivfciKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
