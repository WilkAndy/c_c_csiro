We investigated the presence of disease in the mountain chicken and in the sympatric cane toad Bufo marinus and Johnstone's whistling frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei in the Centre Hills on Montserrat. Skin swabs of mountain chickens and B. marinus, and toe clips from E. johnstonei, were tested for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causative organism of cutaneous chytridiomycosis. Additionally, mountain chicken blood serum samples (n = 57) were examined for exposure to ranavirus. No chytrid or exposure to ranavirus was detected. We draw tentative conclusions about disease threats to the Montserrat mountain chicken population, and present preliminary recommendations for safeguarding this species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4206693848108811493", "cites_id": ["4206693848108811493"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/mountain-chickens-leptodactylus-fallax-and-sympatric-amphibians-appear-to-be-disease-free-on-montserrat/76ACF2C5E9719464F9A23D5D39463AE7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5cRYT8QtYToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
