The major core protein VP7 is believed to be an important structural constituent because it interacts, not only with the underlying core protein VP3, but also with two outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5). In this communication we summarise data on the mapping of at least six different epitopes of VP7 distributed along the molecule. Two of the six epitopes have not been mapped previously. The accessibility of these epitopes in intact virions and core particles was analysed using immunoelectron microscopy. The epitope located near the N-terminus of VP7 was accessible at the surface of intact virions and core particles. Epitopes in other parts of the VP7 molecule were detected weakly in core particles but not in intact virions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6479677343988109268", "cites_id": ["6479677343988109268"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01718592", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1M-OqzZw7FkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
