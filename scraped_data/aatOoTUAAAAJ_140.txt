We are developing BIV as a recombinant viral delivery vector, and as a first step we located specific BIV promoter sequences to drive foreign gene expression in the recombinant virus. By comparison with FV-3 sequences, the genes encoding ICP 18 and ICP 46 in BIV were identified and sequenced. Putative promoter regions of these two early genes and of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene were identified, cloned into pSFM21, and luciferase production was then used to assess the promoter activity of these regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1895259706030730160", "cites_id": ["1895259706030730160"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-005-0532-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sKsSP6lQTRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
