As the disease can be difficult to diagnose on routine pathologic sections, the purpose of this study was to develop an additional method for visualization. To accomplish this, immunohistochemical staining was applied to histologic skin sections from four experimentally infected Dyeing poison dart frogs (Dendrobates tinctorius). Staining of the positive tissue sections was distinct and readily visualized, making this technique a valuable ancillary diagnostic test for this important disease."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2756863262953564145", "cites_id": ["2756863262953564145"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article-abstract/39/3/742/122818", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8eer-odYQiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
