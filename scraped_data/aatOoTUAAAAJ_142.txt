Saprolegnia was reported to kill tadpoles of Spea bombifrons (Bragg and Bragg, 1958), Rana berlandieri and Pseudacris streckeri in pools in Oklahoma (Bragg, 1962). In West Virginia, tadpole edema virus killed tadpoles of Rana catesbiana (Wolf et al., 1968). The bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila, was reported to be the cause of mass mortality of tadpoles of Rana sylvatica in a pond on Rhode Island (Nyman, 1986) and tadpoles of Alytes obstetricans in the Spanish Pyrenean Mountains (Marquez et al., 1995).
