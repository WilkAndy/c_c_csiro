We identified a non-essential gene, the viral homologue of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1), in Bohle iridovirus (BIV, genus Ranavirus). A recombinant BIV was constructed with the neomycin resistance gene and the Bufo marinus (cane toad) adult globin gene inserted into the BIV eIF-2\u03b1 region. Adult globin expressed by the virus was detected on western blot, demonstrating that foreign genes can be expressed by the recombinant BIV in vitro and suggesting the possibility of using a recombinant BIV in the biological control of cane toads."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14141187340129154070", "cites_id": ["14141187340129154070"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093407003291", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FjSmbvaWP8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
