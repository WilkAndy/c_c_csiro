DNA sequencing analysis revealed a single open reading frame (ORF) of 3660 nucleotides (53% G-C content) able to encode 1219 amino acids. Identification was based on a nucleotide sequence identity of approximately 50% to other herpesvirus sequences found in Genbank. Nine motifs were identified that are conserved amongst all known herpesviruses and are found within the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease and DNA binding functional domains of the DNA polymerase enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis using Clustal W with neighbour-joining revealed VHV to group within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, more closely related to the avian herpesviruses than to those of other species.
