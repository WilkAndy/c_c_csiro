Postassium sequestration appeared to occur by the formation of additional crystals whereas sodium appeared to be taken up by pre-existing crystals of the \u201camorphous granule\u201d type. Urate cells increased in cytoplasmic density i.e. mass per unit volume as a result of water deprivation and lost potassium from the cytoplasm but not from the nucleus. Trophocyte cells also showed an increase in density and a loss of potassium from the cytoplasm. The nucleus in trophocyte cells however, did not increase in density and showed an increase in chlorine concentration. A previously undescribed type of crystal in the trophocyte cell cytoplasm also increased markedly in chlorine concentration. The mycetocyte cells did not appear to increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15214065682437958355", "cites_id": ["15214065682437958355"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022191085900988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0-osbyE4I9MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
