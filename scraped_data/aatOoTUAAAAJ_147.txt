Hyatt has been used extensively as a reagent for binding immunoglobulins from many mammalian species. Due to the broad reactivity of the probe and the ease of preparation, protein \u0391-gold remains a popular choice as an immunolabel. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the potential problems associated with protein \u0391-gold as stated in the literature and as recog nized in this laboratory. To understand the potential difficulties, it is nec essary first to discuss the techniques involved with the preparation of colloidal gold and protein \u0391-colloidal gold conjugates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5505972515429135682", "cites_id": ["5505972515429135682"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155432/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QrU3tdQkaUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
