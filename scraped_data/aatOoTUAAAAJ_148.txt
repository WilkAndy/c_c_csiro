This is done without the aid of a constant volume picolitre pipette. A low cost SEM, a standard energy dispersive X-ray detector and a \u2018personal\u2019 microcomputer are used for the analyses of microdroplets. Analytical results do not differ significantly from those obtained by other methods. Analyses of droplets after irradiation by different beam current densities failed to show any elemental sublimation. The advantages of the method are compared to the current methods incorporating fixed-volume pipettes and nebulizers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3679464857652205637", "cites_id": ["3679464857652205637"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0739626085900292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RZjkG8sVEDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
