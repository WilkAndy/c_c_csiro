Species have disappeared across the entire taxonomic group and in nearly all regions of the planet. These figures are probably underestimates as entire clades of species are threatened. For example, of the 113 species of harlequin toads (genus Atelopus), 30 are possibly extinct, and only 10 have stable populations (2). Nearly a quarter of known amphibian species were deemed \u201cdata-deficient\u201d with respect to conservation status in the recent global assessment (1). Losing biodiversity at this taxonomic scale impacts ecosystem goods and services [eg (3, 4)]. As amphibian species disappear, we also lose their untapped potential for advances in biomedicine and biotechnology in general (5).Losses result from familiar threats (land-use change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 342, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3198006615139856230", "cites_id": ["3198006615139856230"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1128396", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zq_CnBKaYSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 21, "2008": 36, "2009": 27, "2010": 20, "2011": 18, "2012": 33, "2013": 29, "2014": 17, "2015": 20, "2016": 19, "2017": 20, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
