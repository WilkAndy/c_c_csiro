CyRV morphologically resembles arenaviruses; however, sequencing identified CyRV as an orthomyxovirus. The high mortality rate among ducks co-infected with salmonellae suggests that CyRV may be pathogenic, either alone or in concert with other infections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13484299889911554439", "cites_id": ["13484299889911554439"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557875/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h2EEl07bIbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
