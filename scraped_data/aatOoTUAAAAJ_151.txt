The affected fish had been taken from local rivers 6 weeks earlier and kept in isolation for 4 weeks with barramundi and 2 bream (Acanthopagrus berda) from other sources prior to introduction into the aquarium. Lymphocystis lesions were seen on barramundi 17 days after their introduction into the aquarium. Histologically, lesions consisted of numerous massively hypertrophied cells enclosed by thick hyaline capsules and separated by loose connective tissue infiltrated with mononuclear inflammatory cells. Lymphocystis virus was identified in samples of nodular lesions examined by electron microscopy. Transmission of the virus with subsequent development of typical lymphocystis lesions was readily achieved in 3 captive barramundi; lesions developed within 13 days of inoculation of homogenised lesions from infected fish. This is the first report of lymphocystis in Australian fish."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4364381867326617580", "cites_id": ["4364381867326617580"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19902209847", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LcoUi9mkTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
