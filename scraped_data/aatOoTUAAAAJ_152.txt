Ranaviruses have been isolated from amphibian, piscine and reptilian species. Here we describe an open reading frame (ORF) identified in the genome of Bohle iridovirus (BIV) which contains a nucleotide binding motif conserved within the thymidine kinase (TK) genes of iridoviruses from other genera (lymphocystis disease virus, LCDV, type species of the genus Lymphocystivirus; Chilo iridescent virus, CIV, type species of the genus Iridovirus). The ability of this putative gene to express a functional TK was confirmed by rescue of a TK negative mutant vaccinia virus in the presence of selective media, when expression was controlled by a vaccinia virus promoter. The sequence of the BIV TK was compared \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11941289963593545987", "cites_id": ["11941289963593545987"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-005-0544-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AznuR_T7t6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
