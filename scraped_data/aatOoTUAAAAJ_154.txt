The capture antibody was an anti-BTV VP7 monoclonal antibody. The CLP concentration in purified preparations was determined to be 6.6\u00d71015 particles/l. CLP concentration in lysates of recombinant baculovirus-infected cells was determined at various times post-infection and shown to reach a value of 3\u00d71015 particles/l of culture medium at 96 h post-infection. The results indicated that immunosorbent electron microscopy, aided by an improved particle counting method, is a simple, rapid and accurate technique for the quantification of virus and virus-like particles produced in large scale in vitro systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10300757691103493859", "cites_id": ["10300757691103493859"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093498001700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:476YV4uk844J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
