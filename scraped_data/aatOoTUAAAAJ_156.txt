Live and moribund fish were submitted for laboratory investigation. All fish showed hyperpigmentation of the cranial half of the body. Histological lesions were seen in all areas of skin examined despite the localised nature of the gross lesions. There was irregular hyperplasia and spongiosis, alternating with areas of thinning and architectural disturbance. Occasionally, particularly in superficial layers of epithelium, cells showed large, eosinophilic inclusions that obscured other cellular detail. A small number of fish had necrosis in dermis, subcutis and superficial muscles. Bacteriological culture of skin and gills was negative for all bacterial pathogens, including Flavibacterium columnare, the agent of columnaris disease.
