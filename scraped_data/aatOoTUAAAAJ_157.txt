Often these must be conducted at many scales such as at the molecular, cellular, organism, and population level. Studies need to consider both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the pathogen/host interaction. They also require a combination of study methods covered by disciplines such as pathology, epidemiology, microbiology, and ecology. Therefore, it is important that disciplines work together when designing and conducting studies. Finally, we need to integrate and interpret data across levels and disciplines to better formulate control strategies. This requires another group of specialists with broad cross-disciplinary training in epidemiology and an ability to readily work with others."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12656958185163943022", "cites_id": ["12656958185163943022"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10393-010-0292-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bmyr82iMpq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
