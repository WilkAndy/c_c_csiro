The experiments were designed to determine whether the NTmAbs were directed against the same or spatially different epitopes.Characteristics of NTmAbs in direct and indirect gold-labelling studies were determined. It was found that the protein A method gave cross-contamination of the immuno-gold complexes whereas direct conjugation of the NTmAbs to gold probes gave clean, specific and intense labelling. Analysis of dilution curves confirmed that saturation of antigenic sites did not occur and secondly determined the optimum working dilutions for the conjugated probes. The data generated in the preliminary studies enabled reliable results to be obtained from the double-labelling competitive experiment. We found that the 2 NTmAbs were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2130628844643996714", "cites_id": ["2130628844643996714"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093488900043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KtQ0SaWDkR0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
