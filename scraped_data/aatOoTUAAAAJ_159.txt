In some countries, considerable effort has been made to establish specific activities including surveillance and integration of wildlife health within diagnostic and research laboratories. We suggest that some of these activities can be improved and many countries still require national structures to deal with wildlife disease investigation and management. We also suggest that scientists in this field should actively engage with national and international organizations and conferences to influence the development of policy, diagnostics, research, and management of emerging wildlife diseases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1047526349270074490", "cites_id": ["1047526349270074490"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10393-015-1045-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:esQaJaqPiQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
