Nipah virus (NiV) is an important threat owing to its broad host and geographical range, high case fatality, potential for human-to-human transmission and lack of effective prevention or therapies. Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 316, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4880306754003277623", "cites_id": ["4880306754003277623"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsif.2011.0223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NxdOwyJVukMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 19, "2013": 33, "2014": 22, "2015": 24, "2016": 24, "2017": 29, "2018": 21, "2019": 29, "2020": 36, "2021": 34, "2022": 24, "2023": 13}}
