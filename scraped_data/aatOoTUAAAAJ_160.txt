SSPE typically affects immunocompetent children, has an insidious onset and follows a steadily progressive course. SME mainly occurs in immunosuppressed children and has a rapidly progressive course. We describe a 43 year old immunocompetent man who presented with a rapidly progressive fatal encephalopathy. Histological examination of the brain showed a meningoencephalitis with inclusion bodies. Complement fixing antibody to measles virus was present in his serum and CSF. Measles virus RNA was found in the brain, spinal cord and eye, but not in the CSF. Analysis of the nucleoprotein gene isolated from this patient did not show similarity to SSPE strains of the measles virus. This patient demonstrates that subacute encephalitis secondary to measles virus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15768172236210719471", "cites_id": ["15768172236210719471"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967586801910628", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:70qEABvN09oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
