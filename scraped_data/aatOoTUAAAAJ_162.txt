In the following 2 decades, orthomyxo-like viruses have been isolated from healthy pilchards in South Australia and Tasmania. In 2006, an orthomyxo-like virus was also isolated from farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Tasmania during routine surveillance and, again, from 2012 onwards from diseased Atlantic salmon. Using transmission electron microscopy, these viruses were identified as belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. To further characterise the viruses, the genomes of 11 viral isolates were sequenced. The open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 10 putative proteins from 8 viral genome segments were assembled from Illumina MiSeq next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The complete genome of a 2014 isolate was also assembled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7057555084960348394", "cites_id": ["7057555084960348394"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v139/p35-50", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6jjQDfV48WEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
