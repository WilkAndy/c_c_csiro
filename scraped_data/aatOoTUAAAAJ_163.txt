It is arguably the most significant recorded infectious disease of any vertebrate class. The disease is reducing amphibian biodiversity across most continents and regions of the world, affecting the resilience of surviving populations and driving multiple species to extinction. It is now recognised by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as an internationally notifiable disease. Collaborative research in areas including the development of diagnostic assays, distribution and impact of the disease, and management (treatment and policy) has assisted in leading a paradigm shift in accepting infectious disease as a major factor influencing wildlife population stability and biodiversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8958175280349657004", "cites_id": ["8958175280349657004"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v92/n2-3/p89-91/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rDftfPTUUXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
