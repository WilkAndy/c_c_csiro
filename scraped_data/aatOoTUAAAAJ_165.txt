Unprocessed gag precursor protein (Pr44) was detected in immunoblot analysis of lysed cells and particles sedimented from culture supernatants after infection with a rW carrying the gag and truncated protease (pro) gene. Processing of Pr44 was observed after infection of cells with a rW carrying the gag and pro gene or a rW expressing the gag, pro and polymerase (pol) gene. Reverse transcriptase activity was detected only in association with particles produced by gag-,pro- andpol- expressing recombinants. Thin section electron microscopic analysis of infected cells and pelleted particles revealed that Pr44 and processed gag proteins assembled at the cell membrane. Pr44 was released into the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15710993352718687755", "cites_id": ["15710993352718687755"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/0022-1317-75-9-2213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cx5SwTapCNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
