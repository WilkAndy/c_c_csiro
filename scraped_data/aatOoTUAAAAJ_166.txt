Haemolymph osmolality rose from 391 to 572mOs/kg; [Na+] from 149 to 289 HIM; and [K+] from 13.0 to 26.3 mM. During dehydration 385 \u03bcig Na (expressed as NaCl) and 41 \u03bcug K (expressed as KCI) were removed from the haemolymph. Rehydration of the dehydrated insects failed to restore the Na+ and K+ concentrations to near their original levels. Approximately 62% of the missing Na+ was excreted, whilst five times the amount of K+ removed from the haemolymph was excreted. It is presumed that the excess represents K+ removed from intracellular fluid."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16077166660096931154", "cites_id": ["16077166660096931154"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1978.tb00150.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UrXUmeWRHd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 2, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2}}
