Daszak, AA Cunningham, and AD Hyatt present a convincing argument in their Review \u201cEmerging infectious diseases of wildlife\u2014threats to biodiversity and human health\u201d(Science's Compass, 21 Jan., p. 443) that emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a risk to wildlife, and they suggest that EIDs most often result from a change in the ecology of the pathogen or the host (or both). A situation they did not mention is that, in some cases, the protection of threatened species can increase the risk of an EID outbreak by allowing a close association between wildlife and domestic animals where one would not have naturally occurred. An important example is northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris)(see figure at left), which were abundant in California and Baja California, Mexico, at the beginning of the 19th century before being nearly eliminated by hunting.
