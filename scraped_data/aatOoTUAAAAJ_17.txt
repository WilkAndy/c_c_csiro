Here we report a recent increase in the elevational limit of anurans following glacial retreat in the tropical Peruvian Andes. Three species have colonized ponds in recently deglaciated terrain at new record elevations for amphibians worldwide (5244\u20135400\u2003m). Two of these species were also found to be infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an emerging fungal pathogen causally associated with global amphibian declines, including the disappearance of several Latin American species. The presence of this pathogen was associated with elevated mortality rates of at least one species. These results represent the first evidence of upward expansion of anurans to newly available habitat brought about by recent deglaciation. Furthermore, the large increase in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 313, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12025010631260966289", "cites_id": ["12025010631260966289"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01278.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kQ2bOHVr4aYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 21, "2009": 28, "2010": 20, "2011": 23, "2012": 26, "2013": 22, "2014": 13, "2015": 23, "2016": 20, "2017": 24, "2018": 17, "2019": 21, "2020": 11, "2021": 18, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
