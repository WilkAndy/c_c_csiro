Two categories, termed \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201catypical\u201d, of variants of TSRV were identified based on preliminary genotypic and phenotypic characterization carried out on these 14 different isolates. In addition, electron microscopic examination indicated the existence of at least three variants based on viral particle size. Finally, this study demonstrated the existence of at least one new variant of TSRV isolates, other than the more commonly isolated typical TSRV isolates, in farmed Tasmanian Atlantic salmon."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4252239698158005380", "cites_id": ["4252239698158005380"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-016-3132-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hKyF5Hn9AjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
