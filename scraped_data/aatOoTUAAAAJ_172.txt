The project has 5 components: Scope Items 1 and 3 being desk top synthesis and evaluation activities, Scope Item 2 being a data gathering and proof of concept activity, Scope Item 4 being a field and laboratory based project testing the protocol developed in Scope Item 3, and Scope Item 5 assessing and evaluating the previous outputs and providing recommendations that need to be addressed to allow a national survey for chytridiomycosis to proceed in an effective manner.  Diagnostic Tests: An analysis of published and unpublished literature identified that chytridiomycosis could be diagnosed by at least 11 tests, that can be collapsed into 5 categories; culture, microscopical examination of unstained epidermis, histology, capture ELISA and PCR. Although each diagnostic test has detection of the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as its final outcome and could on superficial assessment appear to be competing with each other, we discovered that this was true only in part. The tests have different functions and complement, rather than exclude, one another. For example, examination of fresh tissue is an essential test when culture of B.dendrobatidis from infected skin is being attempted in the laboratory. Histology is the diagnostic test of choice for retrospective surveys of archived specimens, and the sensitivity of diagnosis is increased by immunohistochemistry using polyclonal antibodies. For the proposed mapping survey, real-time PCR is the recommended diagnostic technique owing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7584046906339773749", "cites_id": ["7584046906339773749"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/28058/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NU1ItHryP2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
