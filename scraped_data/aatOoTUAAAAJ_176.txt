One type has a layered structure of concentric electron-dense rings around an electron dense core. Radially, there are numerous fine striations that may be needle-shaped crystallites. This type of \u201cconcentric crystal\u201d may be multilobed. A second type of crystal is small and has an amorphous appearance. In addition, another type of crystal is found in the trophocyte cells. Each crystal of this type could be an aggregate of triclinic crystals rather than a single structure.Four types of cell junctions appear to be present: continous or smooth septate junctions; punctate tight junctions; gap junctions; and a novel type of junction (Type 4 junctions). Gap junctions are found only between trophocyte cells and Type 4 junctions only between urate cells.An (Na+, K+)-ATPase is associated with all cell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12204600357436599408", "cites_id": ["12204600357436599408"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020732285900522", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cCydwlxzX6kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
