These declines have been attributed to various diseases and anthropogenic impacts such as habitat destruction (Daszak et al. 1999; Price et al. 2006). Of particular interest to this study are ranaviruses, which are known to be a causal factor in amphibian die-offs worldwide (Cunningham et al. 1996; Fox et al. 2006; Green et al. 2002). Gray et al.(2009a) suggested that ranaviruses can have detrimental effects on localized populations, potentially leading to species declines. In the eastern United States, ranavirus infections have been documented in 33 amphibian species (Miller et al. 2011). In Tennessee, ranavirus has been found in plethodontid salamanders in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (Gray et al. 2009b) and in various species of anurans in farm ponds (Gray et al. 2007; Hoverman et al. 2011a). To date, ranavirus infection in amphibians has not been reported in western Tennessee.
