In a similar manner to ouabain treatment, application of toad extracts over a 24h period resulted in high levels of cytotoxicity, as indicated by cell detachment, increased membrane permeability and loss of mitochondrial function. Cell viability and growth were unchanged for controls (PBS) and increased with the application of Limnodynastes peronii tadpole and adult frog extracts. We investigated the general cytotoxicity of cane toad developmental stages (e.g. eggs, embryonic hatchlings, tadpoles and post-metamorphic toadlets) as well as selected adult tissues (e.g. skin, gut, liver). Our results showed that pre-metamorphic cane toad aqueous extracts used at 1mg/ml on MDCK cells generated cytotoxicity levels comparable to ouabain treatment (3\u03bcM).
