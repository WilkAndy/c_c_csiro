With the exception of the South-East Asian iridoviruses all viruses were found to belong to the genus Ranavirus. All viruses, except those originating from South-East Asia, cross-reacted with antisera against epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV). Viruses or virus-infected cells were examined using electron microscopy, SDS PAGE, restriction endonuclease (RE) digestion, DNA hybridisation, and DNA sequencing. Data from RE digestion of genomic DNA, and from the sequencing of PCR products indicated that the viruses generally grouped according to their geographic and taxonomic (i.e. amphibian or fish) origin. The one exception to this was the viruses from the United Kingdom that grouped with the North American ranaviruses.
