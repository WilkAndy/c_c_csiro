Many studies have investigated the epidemiology of chytridiomycosis in amphibian populations, but few have considered possible host\u2013pathogen coevolution. More specifically, investigations focused on the evolution of Bd, and the link with Bd virulence, are needed. Such studies, which may be important for conservation management of amphibians, depend on access to Bd isolates. Here we provide a summary of known Bd isolates that have been collected and archived in various locations around the world. Of 257 Bd isolates, we found that 53% originate from ranids in the United States. In many cases, detailed information on isolate origin is unavailable, and it is unknown how many isolates are cryo-archived. We suggest the creation of a centralized database \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9702879396350555729", "cites_id": ["9702879396350555729"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v92/n2-3/p109-112/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UXbuJWeNp4YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
