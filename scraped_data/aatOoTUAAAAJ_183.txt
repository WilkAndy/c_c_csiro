Sections containing virus-infected cells were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies and colloidal gold probes to detect virus antigens of varying copy number; these BTV proteins were structural proteins VP2 and VP7 and the non-structural protein NS2. Protocols compared in this study represented those used in laboratories which handle infections agents and as such, all samples were pre-fixed with minimum concentrations of glutaraldehyde to inactivate the virus. No statistical difference was found between the gold-labelling of sections prepared by the progressive lowering of temperature technique and freeze substitution. The results showed that cryo-sections yielded the best signal-to-noise ratio for all proteins examined in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14454931369147436019", "cites_id": ["14454931369147436019"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0968432894900221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8wuvpn47msgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
