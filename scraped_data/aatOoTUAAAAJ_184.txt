Other techniques, namely immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) have increased in popularity to a level where diagnostic immuno-gold procedures are now considered routine. The selection of diagnostic tests depends upon numerous factors such as the form of the sample (clinical or tissue culture) and the number of viruses present. If the sample is clinical and there are sufficient viruses present (> 10\u2019per ml) then classical NCEM can be used; however, if the virus number is low, even after concentration, or the agent has been passaged in tissue culture then the grid-cell-culture technique (GCCT) becomes the preferable diagnostic procedure. Both techniques have their advantages in rapid virus diagnosis and each is discussed below."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=637279871355428485", "cites_id": ["637279871355428485"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1989.tb13574.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hZ6loqoS2AgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
