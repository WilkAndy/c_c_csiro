Here, we offer a generic and highly sensitive visualization approach (oligo fluorescent in situ hybridization, O-FISH) that can be used to detect such nucleic acids using a single-oligonucleotide probe of 19\u201326 nucleotides in length. We used O-FISH to visualize miR146a in human and avian cells. Furthermore, we reveal the sensitivity of O-FISH detection by using a HIV-1 model system to show that as little as 1\u20132 copies of nucleic acids can be detected in a single cell. We were able to discern newly synthesized viral cDNA and, moreover, observed that certain HIV RNA sequences are only transiently available for O-FISH detection. Taken together, these results suggest that the O-FISH method can potentially be used for in situ probing of, as few as, 1\u20132 copies of nucleic acid and, additionally, to visualize small RNA such as miRNA. We further propose that the O-FISH method could be extended to understand viral function by probing newly transcribed viral intermediates; and discern the localisation of nucleic acids of interest. Additionally, interrogating the conformation and structure of a particular nucleic acid in situ might also be possible, based on the accessibility of a target sequence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16681658897714938207", "cites_id": ["16681658897714938207"], "pub_url": "https://bmcmolcellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2121-14-21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X4GIXmIogecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
