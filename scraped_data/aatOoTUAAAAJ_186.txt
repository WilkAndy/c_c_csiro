Both viruses are potential zoonotic agents. In the present study, the infectivity, growth kinetics, morphology and morphogenesis of these two paramyxoviruses in a human neuronal cell (SK-N-SH) line were investigated. Sub-confluent SK-N-SH cells were infected with TioPV and MenPV at similar multiplicity of infection. These cells were examined by conventional and immunoelectron microscopy, and virus titres in the supernatants were assayed. Syncytia were observed for both infections in SK-N-SH cells and were more pronounced during the early stages of TioPV infection. The TioPV titre increased consistently (101) every 12 h after infection. In MenPV-infected cells \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=957745475171437745", "cites_id": ["957745475171437745"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00705-008-0059-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sczUcG-YSg0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
