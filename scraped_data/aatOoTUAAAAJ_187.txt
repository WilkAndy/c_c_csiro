Within the scientific literature an even larger number of ranaviruses, as yet not recognised by the ICTV, have been reported. In this paper we review the major viruses identified within finfish of Australia and discuss the relevance of this in terms of new and emerging viruses, natural viral assemblages and the importance of taxonomy of emerging ranaviruses. We suggest future reviews of the taxonomy of ranaviruses should include universal and polythetic class criteria covering a range of viral and host biotic characteristics. The suggested approach to taxonomy questions the current trend to classify viruses solely by genomic analyses. A suggested approach to classify ranaviruses is outlined whereby iridoviruses from poikilothermic vertebrates can be categorised into genera, species and genotypes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15294580597853752095", "cites_id": ["15294580597853752095"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Whittington3/publication/267256379_Ranaviruses_of_Fish_Amphibians_and_Reptiles_Diversity_and_the_Requirement_for_Revised_Taxonomy/links/548105db0cf263ee1adfad9d.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H4unAwVEQdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2}}
