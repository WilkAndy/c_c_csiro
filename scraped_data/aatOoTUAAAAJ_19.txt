Previous authors have hypothesized that the spread of the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and amphibian ranaviruses are associated with the international trade in live amphibians. The North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is thought to be a carrier of these pathogens, is globally traded as a live commodity, and is sold live in US markets. We obtained importation data for all live amphibians, and parts thereof, into three major US ports of entry (Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York) from 2000 to 2005. Importation of live amphibians into these ports totaled almost 28 million individuals over this 6-year period. We collected samples from freshly-imported market frogs and found infection with both pathogens in all three cities and all seasons, with an overall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 299, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3654725355308025273", "cites_id": ["3654725355308025273"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709000834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uYW_2lgxuDIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 21, "2011": 28, "2012": 20, "2013": 17, "2014": 21, "2015": 18, "2016": 25, "2017": 21, "2018": 23, "2019": 28, "2020": 24, "2021": 28, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
