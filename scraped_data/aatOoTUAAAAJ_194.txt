Pre-treatment of the fat-body donors proved to be extremely important as tissue from hydrated donors responded differently to treatment compared to tissue from dehydrated donors. Of the tissues tested, terminal abdominal ganglion had the most dramatic effect, causing uptake of sodium by hydrated fat body and release of sodium from dehydrated fat body. The uptake-release is sufficient to account for the total amount of sodium removed from or added to the haemolymph during a dehydration-rehydration cycle. Homogenates of brain and the corpus cardiacum-allatum complex promoted the release of sodium from dehydrated fat body, but did not affect that from rehydrated. The results with potassium were much more variable and of lesser magnitude, probably reflecting the lesser \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=556500236872413710", "cites_id": ["556500236872413710"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022191086900041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DnIzWAQWuQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
