Six survey sessions were conducted between 2002 and 2008. Seven 250 m transects located around the edge of the lakes were surveyed at night for 30 minutes each. The first two survey sessions were conducted when the lakes were closed to the sea and their water levels relatively high. The next two survey sessions were conducted when Meroo Lake was open to the sea and the final one when the lake was closed but the water level low. All surveys were conducted after periods of rain to increase the probability of detecting frogs, particularly L. aurea. A total of 54 L. aurea was detected in December 2002 and 46 in February 2003. Breeding activity was observed at five sites. Recently metamorphosed frogs were observed during the late \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16089277799146102224", "cites_id": ["16089277799146102224"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/australian-zoologist/article-abstract/34/3/303/134073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0J2u5umYSN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
