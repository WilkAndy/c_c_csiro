We also have found this new disease associated with morbidity and mortality in wild and captive anurans from additional locations in Australia and Central America. This is the first report of parasitism of a vertebrate by a member of the phylum Chytridiomycota. Experimental data support the conclusion that cutaneous chytridiomycosis is a fatal disease of anurans, and we hypothesize that it is the proximate cause of these recent amphibian declines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 2608, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12460422906020349420", "cites_id": ["12460422906020349420"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.95.15.9031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7MV7aJ1Q7KwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 9, "1999": 23, "2000": 46, "2001": 62, "2002": 46, "2003": 68, "2004": 66, "2005": 76, "2006": 89, "2007": 101, "2008": 105, "2009": 120, "2010": 123, "2011": 139, "2012": 156, "2013": 147, "2014": 135, "2015": 124, "2016": 135, "2017": 144, "2018": 129, "2019": 140, "2020": 101, "2021": 127, "2022": 88, "2023": 40}}
