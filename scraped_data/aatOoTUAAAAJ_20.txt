In 1997, the pregnancy rate and litter size at the piggery decreased markedly, while the proportion of mummified fetuses increased. We found serologic evidence of infection in pigs at the affected piggery and two associated piggeries, in humans exposed to infected pigs, and in fruit bats. Menangle virus is proposed as a common name for this agent, should further studies confirm that it is a newly recognized virus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 293, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12324920372041416460", "cites_id": ["12324920372041416460"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2640116/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DP-ANMfpCqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 6, "1999": 7, "2000": 16, "2001": 17, "2002": 15, "2003": 7, "2004": 11, "2005": 12, "2006": 14, "2007": 18, "2008": 12, "2009": 11, "2010": 8, "2011": 11, "2012": 15, "2013": 15, "2014": 12, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 11, "2020": 6, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
