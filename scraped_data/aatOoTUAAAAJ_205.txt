Surveillance of these two diseases is essential. Effective surveillance of an infectious disease is defined as: collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease specific data, with timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know to allow action to limit or decrease the impact of the disease. The Amphibian Disease Network, established in Australia, has potential to become a highly effective surveillance system for amphibian disease worldwide. The focus to date has been on collection, collation, analysis and interpretation of data on chytridiomycosis, with dissemination of the data via the World Wide Web at the Amphibian Diseases Home Page http://www. jcu. edu. au/school/phtm/PHTM/frogs/ampdis. htm We encourage frog disease researchers to send in survey results on chytridiomycosis for inclusion in the database. Amphibian species, location and dates are presented with the names of the submittors. In the past, collection of data was simplified due to its being generated from a limited number of sources, all of which were fully integrated into the surveillance system. However, a major challenge facing this surveillance system is multiple sources of data as more scientists gain expertise in diagnosis of chytridiomycosis. This will result in data not being captured by the surveillance system. Strategies need to be devised to allow data from all sources to be captured. The concern of some researchers that prompt dissemination of their locality and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4623581805887137521", "cites_id": ["4623581805887137521"], "pub_url": "https://www.iucn-amphibians.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Froglog43.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8abc2SdDKkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
