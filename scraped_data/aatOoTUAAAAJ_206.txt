Since 1992, we have used transmission electron microscopy to examine more than 100 uncharacterized viruses. These viruses were isolated from a range of animals, including mosquitoes, fish, frogs, toads, horses, bats, pigs, kangaroos, and humans. All of these viruses were identified to at least the family level. Of these viruses, 5 have major veterinary, medical, and environmental importance: equine morbillivirus (Hendra virus), which affects humans and horses; Australian bat lyssavirus, which affects humans and bats; pilchard herpes virus, which affects a single species of fish (pilchards); Wallal and Warrego viruses (kangaroo blindness virus), which affect kangaroos and wallabies; iridoviruses, which affect frog populations; and Menangle virus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6900531285373536765", "cites_id": ["6900531285373536765"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0139-7_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_ckouqScw18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
