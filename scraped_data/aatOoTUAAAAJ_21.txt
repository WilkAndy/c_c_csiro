This was the first report of chytridiomycosis in Asia. To assess the risk of pandemic chytridiomycosis to Japanese frogs, we surveyed the distribution of the fungus among captive and wild frog populations. We established a nested PCR assay that uses two pairs of PCR primers to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of a ribosomal RNA cassette to detect mild fungal infections from as little as 0.001\u2003pg (1\u2003fg) of B. dendrobatidis DNA. We collected swab samples from 265 amphibians sold at pet shops, 294 bred at institutes and 2103 collected at field sites from northern to southwestern Japan. We detected infections in native and exotic species, both in captivity and in the field. Sequencing of PCR products revealed 26 haplotypes of the B \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 289, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=507983386103821895", "cites_id": ["507983386103821895"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04384.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R7aEwDK4DAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 19, "2011": 42, "2012": 25, "2013": 29, "2014": 27, "2015": 18, "2016": 19, "2017": 24, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 13, "2021": 21, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
