Microscopy: advances in scientific research and education. Formatex", "pages": "689-696", "abstract": "Many scientific publications, and especially those in the biological sciences, contain micrographs that are described in captions as \u2018representative images\u2019 or \u2018typical images\u2019. Often, these claims are not accompanied by substantiating data, and there is seldom a requirement to provide the data as supplementary material. Poor experimental design and subconscious bias can lead to the publication of images that give a misleading impression to an otherwise objective study. We contend that the term \u2018representative image\u2019can easily mislead the reader. Although it is mostly unintentional, it is unproductive. This chapter aims to highlight the issues leading to subjective selection and display of images. If objective criteria can be met, images are likely to provide meaningful content, and it is less likely that they will be dismissed as anecdotal evidence. It is recommended that author (s) aim to provide the reader with a true sense of the importance of the image in relation to the hypotheses and conclusions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6721797630430437552", "cites_id": ["6721797630430437552"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6721797630430437552&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sGDezVSfSF0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
