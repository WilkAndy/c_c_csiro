Within the past 18 months new viruses have been identified in Australasia. The agents have been identified from cell cultures and/or tissues arising from a range of animals including abalone, amphibians, copepods and bats. Identification of each agent is undertaken in a methodical way whereby discrete datasets are generated via collection of information via negative contrast electron microscopy (NCEM), examination of ultrathin sections and where possible immuno-electron microscopy. The datasets are then used as demarcation criteria to identify the agents to the level of family, or if possible, genus. Of interest is that many of these infectious agents may arguably be inconsequential whilst others have profound impacts on biodiversity, commerce/trade and even human health.Not all new diseases are caused by viruses. Chytridiomycosis for example is a deadly disease of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5239929435277581825", "cites_id": ["5239929435277581825"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/emerging-pathogens-new-identifications-from-australasia-and-contribution-of-electron-microscopy-to-the-detection-of-batrachochytrium-dendrobatidis-and-management-of-chytridiomycosis/96578A17A2D6FAB926805BB59C567FC0", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
