The work resulted in the isolation of seven viruses all of which were identified belonging to the family Iridoviridae and genus Ranavirus. From 1993 to 1997, a $2 million Cane Toad Study completed the ecological work in Venezuela and continued a more intensive investigation of the potential of the isolated viruses as biological control agents. Infection trials at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) found that the Venezuelan viruses killed 80 to 100 per cent of cane toads; associated modelling (Hyatt et al., 1998)) predicted that this high rate would be sufficient to control toad numbers in Australia. Whilst there was much excitement about this work, researchers discovered the viruses were not cane-toad specific and killed Australian frogs (Hyatt et al., 1998); as such these viruses were discarded as potential primary biological control agents.Following a brief absence of federally funded cane toad research, Senator Robert Hill, the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, invited submissions for research initiatives into the biological control of cane toads ($1 million over two years). A successful submission was made by CSIRO Divisions of Animal Health (later to become Livestock Industries) and Sustainable Ecosystems. The proposal involved the development of a modified recombinant ranavirus for the potential control of Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9608239734433580402", "cites_id": ["9608239734433580402"], "pub_url": "https://library.dbca.wa.gov.au/static/FullTextFiles/628735.pdf#page=11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cgW1vyFTV4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
