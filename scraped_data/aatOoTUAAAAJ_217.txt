BIV is the only amphibian virus that has been isolated in Australia and grows well at the temperatures found in northern Australia; however the pathogenicity of the virus means it must be attenuated before it can be used. Pathogenicity testing in cane toad tadpoles showed that BIV was successfully attenuated by passaging 99 times in Vero cells, and also by construction of two recombinant BIV (rBIV) with the neomycin resistance gene inserted into either the BIV eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 gene or the ribonucleotide reductase large subunit gene. Construction of these rBIV demonstrated the capacity of the virus to carry and express foreign DNA. A rBIV expressing the cane toad adult globin gene is the most attenuated virus we have produced so far. Cane toad tadpoles have been infected with this virus and we are currently monitoring the effects of the virus infection on the levels of mRNA for adult globin and tadpole globin in cane toad metamorphs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6871349818902084304", "cites_id": ["6871349818902084304"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Peacock-7/publication/263389030_Investigation_of_a_pathogen_for_Bufo_marinus_in_northern_Argentina_could_it_be_a_trypanosome/links/53f182040cf23733e815bac7/Investigation-of-a-pathogen-for-Bufo-marinus-in-northern-Argentina-could-it-be-a-trypanosome.pdf#page=93", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0HoaG0HwW18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
