Further species impact studies are now under way in the Northern Territory. Over the past three years, for example, ecologists have been gathering data on goanna and freshwater crocodile abundance in the Daly River. The goannas studied include three monitor lizards; Varanus mertensi, Varanus mitchelli and Varanus panoptes, as well as Crocodylus johnstoni, a freshwater crocodile. Sean Doody, a post-doctoral fellow with the University of Canberra says \u2018The latest reports indicate that the cane toads have now hit our monitoring sites, so I expect that when we do our next field trip later this year we will get a greater insight into how the toads impact the goannas and crocodiles in the area\u2019.Other \u2018before and after\u2019research includes a project on water pythons, for which data have been gathered over the last 20 years in the Northern Territory. Rick Shine, Professor in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Sydney, says that \u2018about 20 years ago we started an ecological project at Fogg Dam on water pythons that has since expanded to all of the other snakes in the area. We are looking at the ecological impacts of cane toads on what happens when the toads hit Fogg Dam\u2019. An analysis on the distribution and preferred diet of Australian snakes suggests that it is likely that 49 species are at risk from the invasion of the cane toad."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15277108705525004943", "cites_id": ["15277108705525004943"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=procite:4e2da61d-2c76-4ead-b2bb-e11c51f270fa&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j3rYE20xA9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
