Members of this genus are recognized pathogens of amphibians, reptiles and fish and have been associated with declines of amphibians in the United Kingdom and the USA. Neutron-scattering studies showed that FV3 virions are composed of four concentric layers: an outer lipid envelope containing protein VP58; an icosahedral capsid shell with major capsid protein VP48; an inner lipid membrane with VP63 and 44; and a central core of dsDNA (\u223c170 kbps) and associated proteins. The FV3 genome has a terminally-redundant and circularly-permuted sequence. Naked virions (i.e. without the envelope lipid) contain more than 20 different proteins and about 9% lipid, which is required for infectivity. to date, structural information about FV3 has primarily been obtained in electron microscopy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9921296640615406738", "cites_id": ["9921296640615406738"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/3d-image-reconstruction-of-frog-virus-3-at-26nm/C3D45AABF8C2D3F7F34F6C908CA7D58E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:klwot7qGr4kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
