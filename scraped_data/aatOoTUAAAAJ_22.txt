Morphologically it resembled an iridovirus. Intraperitoneal infection of juvenile Salmo salar caused severe vacuolating lesions of the optic lobe, focal vacuolation in the cerebellar fibre tracts and optic nerve, and hepatocellular necrosis. The virus was re-isolated from brain and anterior kidney. This first virus to be isolated from Australian fish is tentatively assigned to the Iridoviridae, with the name Nillahcootie redfin virus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7900279005042871762", "cites_id": ["7900279005042871762"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19862282163", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0o0OyuVto20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 4, "1991": 4, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 10, "1999": 14, "2000": 8, "2001": 8, "2002": 15, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 12, "2006": 5, "2007": 11, "2008": 9, "2009": 18, "2010": 8, "2011": 13, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
