Aust. Vet. J. 85: 188-193). Subsequently, starting in 2006, the disease (abalone viral ganglioneuritis; AVG) was discovered in wild abalone in Victorian open waters. Currently, it continues to spread, albeit at a slow rate, along the Victorian coast-line. In addition, while AVG has not been reported in wild abalone in Tasmanian waters, disease outbreaks have occurred in Tasmanian processing plants, starting in 2008. A national abalone health plan was developed that identified key research priorities which are currently being addressed. Here, we report on two important aspects of AbHV (1) How soon after infection can virus be detected in neural tissue? and (2) Which class (es) of commonly used chemical compounds can inactivate the virus?
