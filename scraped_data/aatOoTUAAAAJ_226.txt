Examination of the infected cell cultures and associated supernatant by transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of a virus that was absent from control (non-infected) cells. The viruses budded from the plasma membrane, had prominent surface projections and approximated 100 nm in diameter. Internally ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) were present together with electron dense granular particles. This data set was consistent with the virus not being a paramyxovirus, enterovirus or a herpesvirus. The ultrastructure shared characteristics with viruses from the families Orthomyxoviridae and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/novel-orthomyxovirus-of-ducks-ultrastructural-similarities-and-differences-to-arenaviruses/F7852B56762FA9D097F8ED9442C4B995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4eEJrDO3O70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
