Further, recent evidence suggests that surviving amphibian communities may persist with sublethal infections (Rettalick et al. 2004). Although Bd has been detected in amphibians in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP; Chatfield et al. 2009), USA, mortality associated with chytridiomycosis has not been reported. The Southern Appalachian Mountain Range, where GSMNP occurs, is known for its amphibian species richness (Dodd 2004). Within the GSMNP, Cades Cove, Tennessee, is one of the most highly visited sites by tourists, and thus an area where anthropogenic stressors (eg, introduction of chemical agents or novel pathogens) may impact native species. Although amphibian mortality was observed in Cades Cove from 1999 to 2001, these mortality events were attributed to pathogens other than Bd (Dodd 2004; Rothermel et al. 2008). On 5 April 2009, a recently deceased adult male Rana palustris was found in a pond in Cades Cove (35.606667 \u00baN, 83.816944 \u00baW) while conducting field surveillance for Ranavirus. The animal was collected and shipped overnight on ice to the University of Georgia, Veterinary Diagnostic and Investigational Laboratory for diagnostic evaluation. Gross examination revealed only mild (ca. 48 h under refrigeration post field collection) postmortem autolysis. Grossly there was diffuse erythema (reddening) on the ventromedial legs and random petechia (pin-point hemorrhages), ecchymosis (red blotches), and irregular patches of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/27671544/HR_2009_-_40-3_Oxyrhopus_melanogenys_orientalis.pdf#page=67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jd_lcqp3GIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
