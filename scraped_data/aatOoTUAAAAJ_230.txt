Evidence suggests that Bd infected amphibian populations in Central America as early as the 1980s (Pounds et al. 1997). Work done in Central America has implicated that a wave of Bd has moved through the montane regions of Central America and was associated with major declines in amphibian populations and species richness (Lips et al. 2006; Puschendorf et al. 2006). However, in some cases, Bd also may occur in amphibian communities with little or no effect on populations (Berger et al. 1998; Brem and Lips 2008; Garner et al. 2006). We sampled amphibians for the presence of Bd in the K\u00e8k\u00f6ldi Indigenous Reserve in the lower elevations of the Talamanca region, Costa Rica, to determine Bd infection rates in an area not previously surveyed. Also, we attempted to determine which species might be at greatest risk from Bd. Although our study site had not been sampled prior to this study, Bd likely reached this region in the early 1990s (see Lips et al. 2006). We sampled anurans for Bd from 6 to 17 January 2008 in the 3538-ha K\u00e8k\u00f6ldi Indigenous Reserve, located in southeastern Costa Rica near Hone Creek in Limon Province (Fig. 1). The habitat in the reserve is mostly secondary forest, underplanted with cacao trees; however some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/27671544/HR_2009_-_40-3_Oxyrhopus_melanogenys_orientalis.pdf#page=57", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9UnTrVzSztgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
