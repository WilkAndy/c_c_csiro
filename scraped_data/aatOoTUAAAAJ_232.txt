In this context, diseases of aquatic organisms, \nincluding aquatic parasitology, constitute increasingly important fields of study. Diseases and \nparasites affect all aquatic life. Parasites can infest all organs, and thus may lead to mortality, \nimpaired reproduction, or reduced growth. Such a great range of negative consequences may \nnot only affect individual aquatic organisms, but also populations and ecosystems.
