However since the mid 1990s there has been the emergence of many diseases which have impacted on human, veterinary and wildlife health. These diseases are referred to as emerging infectious diseases which are defined as those that have recently increased in incidence, impact or geographic range; that are caused by pathogens that have recently evolved; that are newly discovered; or that have recently changed their clinical presentation. These diseases have become recognised as one of the most important threats to public, veterinary and wildlife health. Many of these new diseases are consequential to continued anthropogenic changes that serve to provide unique opportunities for the overlapping of na\u00efve hosts with animals that have in many cases co-evolved with specific infectious \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/working-towards-objective-detection-of-unknown-pathogens-via-a-coordinated-virtual-multiplex-microscopical-platform/9EDE78322605507BD86A39F77E232946", "cites_per_year": {}}
