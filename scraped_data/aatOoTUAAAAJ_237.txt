Species have disappeared across theentire taxonomic group and in nearly all regionsof the planet. These figures are probably under-estimates as entire clades of species are threat-ened. For example, of the 113 species of harle-quin toads (genus Atelopus), 30 are possiblyextinct, and only 10 have stable populations (2).Nearly a quarter of known amphibian specieswere deemed \u201cdata-deficient\u201d with respect toconservation status in the recent global assess-ment (1). Losing biodiversity at this taxonomicscale impacts ecosystem goods and services[e.g. (3, 4)]. As amphibian species disappear, wealso lose their untapped potential for advances inbiomedicine and biotechnology in general (5). Losses result from familiar threats (land-usechange, commercial overexploitation, and exoticspecies) and from the emerging infectious dis-ease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Pre-dictions are that within 4 to 6 months of Bdarrival at a site where it has not previously beenpresent, ~50% of amphibian species and ~80%of individuals may disappear (6). Global climatechange may be encouraging local conditionsideal for Bd\u2019s persistence and/or spread (7), com-mercial trade of wildlife may also contribute (8),and pollution may increase susceptibility ofspecies to pathogens (9, 10). Traditional pro-grams and current laws and policies alone areinsufficient to address global threats that crossboundaries of reserves and nation"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8757362612731169519&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
