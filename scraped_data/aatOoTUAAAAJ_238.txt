In nearly all cases the emergence can be attributed to environmental perturbations via some aspect of human behaviour. Examples of such environmental perturbations can include altered habitat (changes in the number of vector breeding sites and/or host reservoirs), niche invasions (interspecies host-transfers), changes in biodiversity, human-induced genetic changes of disease vectors or pathogens (eg mosquito resistance, emergence of disease resistant strains of microbes) and environmental contamination of infectious agents (eg dissemination of microbes into water bodies). Whilst the significance of this area of \u2018health\u2019is emerging in terms of politics, general health and trade there is a requirement to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/echohealth-and-the-identification-of-new-viruses/F694A6AEAD1DC523E356F150E5DA42DA", "cites_per_year": {}}
