Using a crossover design, the snakes were first given 10 mg/kg azithromycin IC. After a four week washout period, they were given the same dose PO. Blood samples were collected 1-wk prior to drug administration and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr after dosing in both cases. One snake died from nonregenerative anemia, two week after receiving IC azithromycin; no other problems were detected. In a second phase, six snakes were given 10 mg/kg azithromycin PO. Snakes were euthanized at 24 hr (three snakes) and 72 hr (four snakes) after drug administration. Blood and tissue (liver, kidney, lung, and skin) samples were collected and assayed for azithromycin using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic calculations were performed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jhms/article-abstract/15/1/36/137505", "cites_per_year": {}}
