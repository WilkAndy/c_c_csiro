A vast array of aquatic animal species is farmed in high density in freshwater, brackish and marine systems where they are exposed to new environments and potentially new diseases. On-farm stresses may compromise their ability to combat infection, and farming practices facilitate rapid transmission of disease. Viral pathogens, whether they have been established for decades or whether they are newly emerging as disease threats, are particularly challenging since there are few, if any, efficacious treatments, and the development of effective viral vaccines for delivery in aquatic systems remains elusive. Here, we review a few of the more significant viral pathogens of finfish, including aquabirnaviruses and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus which have been known since the first half of the 20th century, and more recent viral pathogens, for example betanodaviruses, that have emerged as aquaculture has undergone a dramatic expansion in the past few decades."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15370802727097234909", "cites_id": ["15370802727097234909"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/29062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3XU8baQPUNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 17, "2014": 17, "2015": 10, "2016": 23, "2017": 28, "2018": 34, "2019": 28, "2020": 25, "2021": 21, "2022": 29, "2023": 15}}
