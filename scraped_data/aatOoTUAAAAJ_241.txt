The identification of the \u2018new\u2019, viruses may be due to the increased number of viral spill-over events that have occurred due to the increased impact of humans on the environment. Whilst this topic is of immense interest as it relates to changes of the planets \u2018health\u2019, it is the impact of such spillovers on human health that receives much of our attention. For example in 1995 an important zoonotic virus was identified in Australia. This virus, termed Hendra virus (HeV)[family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus], was the first of four bat viruses that would have an impact on trade and/or veterinary and/or human health within their country of origin. The original identification was dependent upon an established analytical tool, namely electron microscopy. The resultant data from this original work laid the foundation for the ultrastructural and antigenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/e0f1b5a667b95c7fc2c9567a073f208e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=33692", "cites_per_year": {}}
