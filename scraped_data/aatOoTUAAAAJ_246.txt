The recent finding that reptile mothers may allocate sex (Olsson and Shine 2001) further highlights the importance of future studies of nest site choice in reptiles, and emphasizes the importance of the links among nest site choice, nest temperatures, and the developing embryo.Quantifying nest site choice in the field, however, has not always been straightforward for several reasons. First, traditionally most studies measure attributes of nest sites that likely explain less variation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Harlow-2/publication/290276328_Quantifying_nest_site_choice_in_reptiles_using_hemispherical_photography_and_gap_light_analysis/links/578593cf08aef321de2a9bd3/Quantifying-nest-site-choice-in-reptiles-using-hemispherical-photography-and-gap-light-analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zFi6eLjyxCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
