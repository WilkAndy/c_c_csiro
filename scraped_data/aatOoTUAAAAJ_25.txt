Electron microscopic examination of Pteropid bat and mouse brain material as well as virus isolated from tissue culture medium, showed the presence of bullet-shaped rhabdovirus particles and structures characteristic of lyssavirus. Analysis using nucleocapsid (N) specific monoclonal antibodies, showed a strong relationship between this new lyssavirus and serotype 1 rabies. The nucleotide sequence of the prototype strain of ABLV was determined from the initiator methionine codon for the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) to the amino terminus of the polymerase gene (L protein), a distance of 5344 nucleotides. Comparisons of the deduced N, phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), and glycoprotein (G \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3527837217759984844", "cites_id": ["3527837217759984844"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170298000252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zHz8HUJl9TAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 9, "2000": 12, "2001": 13, "2002": 9, "2003": 16, "2004": 11, "2005": 21, "2006": 14, "2007": 16, "2008": 16, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 12, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
