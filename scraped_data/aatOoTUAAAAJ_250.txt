The answers lie in the ability to build effective teams and to recognize the unique contributions of disciplines such as electron microscopy and the associated skill bases. The success in Australia for the rapid and accurate identification of new viruses has, in the main, been attributed to the effective use of electron microscopy. Data generated from such investigations have provided the foundation for subsequent studies involving the above areas of diagnostic inquiry. Data presented in this paper overviews some of the successes of electron microscopy and highlights its continued role in the identification of \u2018emerging pathogens\u2019 that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mam/article-abstract/7/S2/176/6904696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rLlSSAn17yoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
