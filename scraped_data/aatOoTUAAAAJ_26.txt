Reoviruses (respiratory enteric orphan viruses) were first isolated from humans in the early 1950s and so named because they were not associated with any known disease. Here, we report a previously unknown reovirus (named \u201cMelaka virus\u201d) isolated from a 39-year-old male patient in Melaka, Malaysia, who was suffering from high fever and acute respiratory disease at the time of virus isolation. Two of his family members developed similar symptoms \u22481 week later and had serological evidence of infection with the same virus. Epidemiological tracing revealed that the family was exposed to a bat in the house \u22481 week before the onset of the father's clinical symptoms. Genome sequence analysis indicated a close genetic relationship between Melaka \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7822887888002547944", "cites_id": ["7822887888002547944"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0701372104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6AAZMhZ7kGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 13, "2009": 14, "2010": 8, "2011": 21, "2012": 11, "2013": 17, "2014": 17, "2015": 23, "2016": 17, "2017": 10, "2018": 12, "2019": 17, "2020": 20, "2021": 18, "2022": 13, "2023": 10}}
