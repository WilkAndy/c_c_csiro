The success of colloidal Au in TEM is attributable to the particulate nature of the probes, the ability to produce monodisperse solutions of uniform shape and size, the maintenance of the biological activity of Au-complexed antibodies, and the particles being electron dense to the electron beam. Other character-istics such as the generation of high energy secondary electron signals, high back scattered electron coefficient (compared to organic elements), the pro-duction of characteristic X-rays and the ability to physically enlarge colloidal Au particles by silver (Ag) enhancement also make colloidal Au an excellent marker for scanning electron microscopy. To date, the vast majority of im-muno-gold scanning electron microscopy (ISEM) has been applied to both animal and plant cells and tissues (refer to Reference 1). There have been few publications involving ISEM in the study of viruses or virus-infected cells. 2-5"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QwmSZrCvETUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA411&dq=info:TPeX9vcyKaYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=VnpvOo_LMb&sig=ZpZLzAR_uYNgx5zq3ErKuGmwPfU", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TPeX9vcyKaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
