Both these techniques are used in diagnostic laboratories throughout the world. NCEM is discussed in Chapters 1, 2, and 3. It provides the means of visualizing the substructure of viruses, and it is this information which can be used in virus classification. The procedure frequently requires steps, in addition to staining with heavy metal salts, that involve the isolation of viruses from their host environment and adsorption to a grid substrate. These initial isolation pro-cedures are varied and depend on both the nature of the submitted sample and the suspected virus. Samples can come in many forms, for example, scabs, nasal swabs, feces, allantoic fluid, biopsied or autopsied tissue and tissue culture cells, and supernatant. In some instances, it is necessary to only adsorb the fluid samples to filmed grids, stain, and examine. Other samples, however, may require treatments that may include homogenization, shearing (douncing), precipitation, osmotic shock, or ultracentrifugation. These techniques can have a profound effect on virus morphology, production of con-fusing artifacts, and immunogenic background.
