In pigs, the virus induced a respiratory and neurological syndrome consistent with that observed in the Malaysian pigs. Not all the pigs showed clinical signs, but Nipah virus was recovered from the nose and oropharynx of both clinically and sub-clinically infected animals. Natural infection of in-contact pigs, which was readily demonstrated, appeared to be acute and self-limiting. Subclinical infections occurred in both inoculated and in-contact pigs. Respiratory and neurological disease was also produced in the cats, with recovery of virus from urine as well as from the oropharynx. The clinical and pathological syndrome induced by Nipah virus in cats was comparable with that associated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4302149468801367147", "cites_id": ["4302149468801367147"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997501905328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a3yK6iVOtDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 15, "2007": 14, "2008": 14, "2009": 11, "2010": 7, "2011": 17, "2012": 20, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 15, "2017": 5, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 15, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
