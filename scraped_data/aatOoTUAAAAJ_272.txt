Nipah virus infection is associated with a case-fatality ratio of 40% to 76% in humans (1, 2). Cats (Felis catus) were infected with NiV at the site of the outbreak in northern Malaysia (3). Experimental studies have shown that cats are susceptible to Hendra virus and NiV (4, 5). Infected cats shed NiV through the nasopharynx and in urine while viremic, and 1 (of 2) recovered from experimental NiV infection with a high neutralizing antibody titer (> 256) within 21 days (5). Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are believed to be the reservoir for NiV in Malaysia (6). In June 2000, NiV was isolated from partially eaten fruit and from the urine of Pteropus hypomelanus in the village of Air Batang on Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia (7). Although humans live in close proximity to these bats, no evidence for local human exposure to NiV has been seen (8). In contrast, epidemiologic evidence from recent NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh suggests that direct infection from pteropid bats may occur, possibly when bats are pregnant (2, 9). Despite limited contact with bats, residents and visitors to Air Batang have ample opportunity for close contact with feral cats, which are often fed and sometimes housed by residents. Cats have been observed under trees that are occupied by roosting fruit bats in Air Batang. NiV could be transmitted from bats to cats through urine and then among cats oronasally, given their gregarious nature, which frequently includes mutual grooming.
