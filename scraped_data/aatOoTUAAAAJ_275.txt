Live lice were collected from male and female southern elephant seals of known age that had returned to Macquarie Island for breeding, the annual molt, and the mid-year haulout. The animals were part of life history studies at Macquarie Island. Prior to examination, the animals were anesthetised with a 1: 1 mixture of Tiletamine and Zolazepam as described previously (21). The skin of the seal was searched for lice, which were most often encountered on the hind ffippers (24). Lice were removed with a pair of fine forceps, snap frozen, stored at 80 C in glass vials, and shipped to mainland Australia. Bleeding of seals. A 10-ml blood sample was collected from anesthetised seals (see above) via the extradural-intravertebral vein in the lower lumbar region, using a 90-mm 18-gauge spinal needle. The blood was left to clot for 30 min and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3,000 g. The serum was collected, stored at 80 C, and shipped to mainland Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=42044c41766a2fa363c7501420a860882da0997e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ijXnqd8L4aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
