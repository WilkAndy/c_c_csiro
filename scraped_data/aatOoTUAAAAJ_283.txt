It is therefore fitting that we begin by focusing on amphibian chytridiomycosis, a panzootic emerging disease described in 1998 that has already achieved notoriety due to its association with the global phenomenon of amphibian population declines.Over the past three decades, amphibian population declines have been reported in North, Central and South America, Europe, India and Australia 1. In most areas habitat loss is probably the major cause, although a range of other hypotheses have been proposed.
