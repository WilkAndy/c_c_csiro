Diagnosis of chytridiomycosis to date has largely relied upon histological and immunohistochemical examination of toe clips. This technique is invasive and insensitive particularly at early stages of infection when treatment may be possible. We have developed a real-time PCR Taqman assay that can accurately detect and quantify one zoospore in a diagnostic sample. This assay will assist the early detection of B. dendrobatidis in both captive and wild populations, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, thus facilitating treatment and protection of endangered populations, monitoring of pristine environments and preventing further global spread via amphibian trade."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 1402, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4823338445326226159", "cites_id": ["4823338445326226159"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v60/n2/p141-148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:75InycLw70IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 9, "2006": 24, "2007": 42, "2008": 42, "2009": 57, "2010": 62, "2011": 75, "2012": 82, "2013": 108, "2014": 92, "2015": 92, "2016": 97, "2017": 111, "2018": 98, "2019": 99, "2020": 91, "2021": 105, "2022": 79, "2023": 21}}
