The trainer of the horses had been hospitalized for a respiratory disease and was in critical condition. At that time, the cause of the horses\u2019 illness was unclear and any link between equine and human disease was thought improbable. Poisoning, bacterial, viral, and exotic disease causes were investigated. The history of the horses on this property was considered important (Figure 1). Two weeks before the trainer\u2019s illness, on September 7, two horses had been moved to the Hendra stable from a spelling paddock in Cannon Hill (6 km). One of these, a pregnant mare, was sick and died within 2 days. The other horse was subsequently moved on and never became sick \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1491820199524870232", "cites_id": ["1491820199524870232"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2626820/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WKhuRZECtBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 8, "2001": 8, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 7, "2005": 5, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 12, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 14, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 13, "2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
