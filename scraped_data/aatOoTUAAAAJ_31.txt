An accurate, non-invasive technique for detecting chytridiomycosis is urgently needed to determine the current geographical distribution of the disease, and its prevalence in wild amphibian populations. Herein we evaluate a recently devised, rapid, non-invasive, swab-PCR assay. We sampled 101 wild juvenile Mixophyes iteratus by both a skin swab for use in PCR analysis, and a toe-clip for examination by histological methods. The swab-PCR assay detected chytridiomycosis infection in a minimum of 14.9% of frogs, whereas histology detected infection in no more than 6.9% of frogs. We conclude that the swab-PCR technique is the more reliable means of detecting chytridiomycosis in wild amphibians, and that it precludes the need for toe-clipping as a means of sampling for the presence of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18110083289825234827", "cites_id": ["18110083289825234827"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v71/n2/p141-148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i0_F_szwU_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 12, "2008": 15, "2009": 16, "2010": 13, "2011": 17, "2012": 15, "2013": 12, "2014": 17, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 16, "2019": 14, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 4}}
