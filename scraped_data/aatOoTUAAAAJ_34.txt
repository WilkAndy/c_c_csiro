Large amounts of picorna-like viral particles were found associated with these lesions when brain and retinal tissue was examined by electron microscopy.Epizootological data suggested that vertical transmission of the infectious agent is not a common occurrence, and most transfer of infection is probably from previously-hatched juveniles to recentlyhatched larvae. These data include the observation that adequate isolation of older juvenile fish from recently-hatched larvae, coupled with between-hatch cleaning and disinfection of the premises, has apparently controlled mass mortalities in one large hatchery."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16180601826732482995", "cites_id": ["16180601826732482995"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004484869290166I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:syFtBqILjeAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 10, "1998": 6, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 11, "2002": 10, "2003": 4, "2004": 8, "2005": 6, "2006": 8, "2007": 1, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 13, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
