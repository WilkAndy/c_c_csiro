Examination of cells infected with recombinants that express core-like particles (CLPs) composed of VP3 and VP7 showed that CLPs were present within the soluble fraction of the cells and not associated with the cell cytoskeleton. The simultaneous expression of the nonstructural NS1 or NS3/NS3A proteins with CLPs did not lead to the association of such particles with the cytoskeleton, nor to their release from cells. The failure of CLPs synthesized in the presence of VP2 or VP5 to attach to the cytoskeleton indicated that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13025223226790834437", "cites_id": ["13025223226790834437"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283711670", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BfEIoYPjwrQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 8, "1995": 5, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 7, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 10, "2009": 15, "2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 4, "2014": 13, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
