We examine the role of these diseases in the global decline of amphibian populations and propose hypotheses for the origins and impact of these panzootics. Finally, we discuss emerging infectious diseases as a global threat to wildlife populations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 1341, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5407714340054941768", "cites_id": ["5407714340054941768"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2640803/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SMDCfYoPDEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 11, "2001": 35, "2002": 39, "2003": 57, "2004": 45, "2005": 56, "2006": 71, "2007": 73, "2008": 63, "2009": 70, "2010": 71, "2011": 62, "2012": 62, "2013": 74, "2014": 57, "2015": 54, "2016": 63, "2017": 66, "2018": 54, "2019": 58, "2020": 44, "2021": 47, "2022": 45, "2023": 14}}
