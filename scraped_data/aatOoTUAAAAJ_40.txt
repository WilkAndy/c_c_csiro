The virus displayed classic alphavirus ultrastructure and appeared to be serologically different from known Australasian alphaviruses. Nearly all Macquarie Island elephant seals tested had neutralizing antibodies against the virus, but no virus-associated pathology has been identified. Antarctic Division personnel who have worked extensively with elephant seals showed no serological evidence of exposure to the virus. Sequence analysis illustrated that the southern elephant seal (SES) virus segregates with the Semliki Forest group of Australasian alphaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of known alphaviruses suggests that alphaviruses might be grouped according to their enzootic vertebrate host class. The SES virus represents the first arbovirus of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15625902162992565162", "cites_id": ["15625902162992565162"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/jvi.75.9.4103-4109.2001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qgsuSDpb2tgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 14, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
