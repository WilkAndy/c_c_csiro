Both groups of viruses have a complex envelope structure. In this study, the mechanism of formation of the inner envelope of ASF virus was investigated. Examination of thin cryosections by electron microscopy showed two internal membranes in mature intracellular virions and all structural intermediates. These membranes were in continuity with intracellular membrane compartments, suggesting that the virus gained two membranes from intracellular membrane cisternae. Immunogold electron microscopy showed the viral structural protein p17 and resident membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within virus assembly sites, virus assembly intermediates, and mature virions. Resident ER proteins were also detected by Western blotting of isolated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4111716820195283350", "cites_id": ["4111716820195283350"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/JVI.72.3.2373-2387.1998", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lhG9xKnADzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 8, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
