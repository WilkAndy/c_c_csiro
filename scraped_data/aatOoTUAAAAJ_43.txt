Mechanisms of change occur through a variety of ways, including altered habitats or breeding sites for disease vectors or reservoirs, niche invasions, loss of predator species, biodiversity change, host transfer, and changes in (intermediate) host population density.Infectious diseases stemming from health infrastructural deficiencies, such as poor sanitation and lack of adequate vaccine coverage, as well as those linked to specific sociocultural factors, such as airborne and sexually transmitted diseases, are not covered in this chapter, even though these lead to a large global burden of disease. Readers should refer to Chapter 5 of this volume and Chapter 12 of Policy Responses for an assessment of noninfectious disease and related health topics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3382447869321138643", "cites_id": ["3382447869321138643"], "pub_url": "http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.283.aspx.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:09Epimre8C4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 14, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
