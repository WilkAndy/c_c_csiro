Large\u2010scale production of the North American bullfrog for human consumption has been ongoing since the early part of the 20th century, particularly in Brazil, a pioneer in bullfrog farming following its introduction in the 1930s. In order to determine whether bullfrogs introduced to Brazil and farmed for the food trade serve as reservoirs for amphibian disease, we tested individuals located in the Brazilian states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Par\u00e1 to determine the prevalence of B. dendrobatidis infections. We were able to confirm B. dendrobatidis on five farms (78.5% infection prevalence overall) by PCR. Isolates were obtained from three of the five farms and genotyped at 17 loci using multilocus sequence typing. Five isolates from the Brazilian farms were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17295176060974289992", "cites_id": ["17295176060974289992"], "pub_url": "https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00307.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SFQ2Yv7OBPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 21, "2013": 11, "2014": 8, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
