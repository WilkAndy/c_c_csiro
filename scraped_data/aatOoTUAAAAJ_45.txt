VIBs were detected as early as 4 h post-infection (p.i.), and their number and profile areas increased significantly between 12 and 16 h, and 20 and 28 h p.i. respectively. Core- and virus-like particles were found within and at the periphery of the VIB matrix, respectively, and their numerical density (number per area of VIB matrix) decreased during the course of infection whereas the numerical density of virus particles in the cytoplasm increased. Virus-like particles had a diameter of 57 \u00b1 8 nm and core-like particles appeared to fall into two size ranges, 32 \u00b1 3 nm and 38 \u00b1 3 nm in diameter. Both pre- and post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy procedures were used to localize BTV structural and non-structural proteins within the VIBs.
