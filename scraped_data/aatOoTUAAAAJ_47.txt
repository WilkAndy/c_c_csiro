Current surveillance is based on the detection of B. dendrobatidis in its host but in vitro work suggests infective stages may survive in the abiotic environment for at least 3 mo. We describe here a surveillance system using filtration and quantitative PCR that can detect B. dendrobatidis in small (< 1 l) volumes of water. After assessing the analytical sensitivity of the protocol for both water and sediment samples in the laboratory, we analyzed environmental samples from the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range in Spain at locations associated with chytrid-related die-offs and at other sites across Spain. B. dendrobatidis was detected in samples from 64% of the ponds in the Sierra de Guadarrama and at 2 sites outside this region, showing that levels of amphibian exposure to B \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18365655999956699170", "cites_id": ["18365655999956699170"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v77/n2/p105-112/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IshwmNPq3_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 14, "2010": 9, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
