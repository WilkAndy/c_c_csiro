A DNA clone encoding the target antigen was digested randomly with DNase I to generate a population of DNA fragments of different sizes and sequences. After size fractionation, small DNA fragments (100\u2013200 bp) were isolated and cloned into the phage expression vector fUSE2 to form an expression library displaying random polypeptide sequences as fusion proteins at the N terminus of the phage gene III protein. This library, termed a gene-targeted random epitope library to distinguish it from totally random synthetic epitope libraries, was then screened by affinity selection for recombinant phages which were specifically bound by the antibody of interest. Using this approach, we have mapped a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-defined epitope on the bluetongue virus outer capsid protein VP5. This epitope is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6827666234812726899", "cites_id": ["6827666234812726899"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002217599400235O", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c_7wGkS-wF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 10, "1997": 9, "1998": 6, "1999": 7, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4}}
