Subsequent investigation revealed that this particular HMC line was infected with a previously unknown paramyxovirus. Here, we report the isolation and genome characterization of this new virus, now named Beilong virus (BeV). The genome of BeV is 19,212 nucleotides (nt) in length and is the largest among all known members of the order Mononegavirales. The BeV genome contains eight genes in the order 3\u2032-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5\u2032. The SH and TM genes code for a small hydrophobic protein of 76 aa and a transmembrane protein of 254 aa, respectively. The BeV G gene, at 4527 nt, codes for an attachment protein of 734 aa and contains two additional open reading frames (ORFs) in the 3\u2032 half of the gene, coding for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11642792331051847883", "cites_id": ["11642792331051847883"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205007336", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y9D8XfCBk6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
