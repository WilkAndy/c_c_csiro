In the current review we highlight an important series of wildlife EIDs: amphibian chytridiomycosis; diseases of marine invertebrates and vertebrates and two recently-emerged viral zoonoses, Nipah virus disease and West Nile virus disease. These exemplify the varied etiology, pathogenesis, zoonotic potential and ecological impact of wildlife EIDs. Strikingly similar underlying factors drive disease emergence in both human and wildlife populations. These are predominantly ecological and almost entirely the product of human environmental change. The implications of wildlife EIDs are twofold: emerging wildlife diseases cause direct and indirect loss of biodiversity and add to the threat of zoonotic disease emergence. Since human environmental changes are largely responsible for their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 1259, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10626089999845094921", "cites_id": ["10626089999845094921"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X00001790", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CfYYMI50d5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 12, "2003": 16, "2004": 35, "2005": 39, "2006": 27, "2007": 50, "2008": 40, "2009": 51, "2010": 54, "2011": 59, "2012": 61, "2013": 74, "2014": 72, "2015": 78, "2016": 71, "2017": 76, "2018": 67, "2019": 70, "2020": 96, "2021": 89, "2022": 85, "2023": 23}}
