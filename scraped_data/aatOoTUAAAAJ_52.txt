A multi-disciplinary approach was adopted to define the condition. Histopathological and transmission electron microscopic examination combined with immunohistochemistry help define Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) as a neoplastic condition of cells of neuroendocrine origin. Cytogenetic analysis of neoplastic tissue revealed it to be markedly different from normal devil tissue and having a consistent karyotype across all tumours examined. Combined with evidence for Major histocompatability (MHC) gene analysis there is significant evidence to confirm the tumour is a transmissible neoplasm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4221896336449164410", "cites_id": ["4221896336449164410"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10393-007-0126-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:elSTdFkwlzoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 14, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
