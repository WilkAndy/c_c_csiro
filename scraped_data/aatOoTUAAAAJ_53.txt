It has been associated with catastrophic declines of frog populations including those in pristine habitats in Queensland, Australia. To facilitate genetic and disease studies of this fungus and related species, it is essential to have a reliable long-term storage method to maintain genetic integrity of isolates. We have adapted well-established techniques used for the long-term storage of tissue-culture cell lines to the preservation of B. dendrobatidis and other chytridiomycetes. This simple method has allowed us to recover these fungi from storage at-80 C and in liquid nitrogen over an extended period. With this technique it is now possible to preserve saprobic and parasitic isolates from a variety of environmental and disease situations for comparative genetic and biological studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12775381749411087548", "cites_id": ["12775381749411087548"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v56/n1/p59-64/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vASoowNGS7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 13, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 8}}
