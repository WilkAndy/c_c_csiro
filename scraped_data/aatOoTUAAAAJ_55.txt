Analysis of the expressed product showed that the recombinant protein, which is 60 kDa in size, was antigenic as revealed by its reactions in ELISA and Western blot with the antibodies raised against RHDV. Direct electron microscopy of the cell culture supernatant and the purified protein demonstrated that the capsid protein expressed in insect cells self-assembled to form empty virus-like particles (VLP) which are similar in size and morphology to that of native virus. These particles were immunoreactive with polyclonal anti-RHDV antibodies and with four monoclonal antibodies which recognise conformational epitopes of the virus. The results indicated that the VLPs were morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from native virus. The recombinant VLPs induced high levels of RHDV-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7518771600772016287", "cites_id": ["7518771600772016287"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01315418", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n6hPS-8KWGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 9, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 8, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 9, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
