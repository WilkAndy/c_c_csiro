Neither the proportion nor the species of virus protein associated with the cytoskeleton was altered following treatment of infected cells with microtubule or microfilament disrupting drugs (colchicine and cytochalasin B, respectively). Electron microscopic examination of BTV-infected cells revealed cytoplasmic virus-specified tubules, viral inclusion bodies (VIB), and progeny virus particles. Whole-mount transmission electron microscopy of nonionic detergent-extracted cells demonstrated the association of VIB, virus particles, and tubules with the cytoskeleton. The identity of virus particles was confirmed with an immunogold labeling technique using a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9411703640750337184", "cites_id": ["9411703640750337184"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287903199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oKwsjpgWnYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 6, "1989": 9, "1990": 9, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 6, "1994": 8, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
