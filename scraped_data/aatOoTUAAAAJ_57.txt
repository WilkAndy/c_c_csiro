European catfish virus (ECV) and sheatfish virus (ESV) have caused epizootics in fish on farms in continental Europe. Currently there are no simple or readily available methods to distinguish these viruses, which are in the Iridoviridae. They are culturally, morphologically and antigenically very similar to Frog Virus 3 (FV3), the type species in Ranavirus in this family and Gutapo virus (GV), another amphibian ranavirus from America. The diseases caused by EHNV, ESV and ECV are so serious that they are internationally notifiable. Tests to distinguish these viruses are desirable to ensure that disease occurrences do not unnecessarily restrict trade in aquaculture products.
