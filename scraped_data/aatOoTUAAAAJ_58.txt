Oxford: Oxford University Press", "abstract": "13.1 BackgroundEmerging zoonotic pathogens represent a key threat to global public health and constitute around 75% of all known emerging pathogens (Taylor et al. 2001, Smolinski et al. 2003). Of particular concern are a number of viruses that emerged recently from wildlife, are lethal to humans (eg Ebola virus), capable of spreading rapidly (eg SARS coronavirus), and have caused recent pandemics (eg HIV-1 and Influenza virus)(Morse 1993; Burke 1998). For many of the emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) caused by these viruses, there are few effective therapies, vaccines, or other preventative strategies. Consequently, surveillance and control programs and the development of drug and vaccine candidates are a high priority for public health programs (Smolinski et al. 2003). However, control programs require an understanding of the causes of emergence and of host and pathogen population dynamics. This is a challenge because many emerging zoonotic viruses have multiple wildlife reservoir hosts (eg hantavirus, West Nile virus) or emerge via complex transmission pathways (eg Ebola virus, Nipah virus). To understand this process therefore requires study of viral dynamics within each important wildlife reservoir species (eg among age classes and sexes), among reservoir species as well as between reservoir, domestic animal, and human populations. Because viral transmission often requires direct contact between animals, understanding the population dynamics and contact rates at different spatial and temporal scales is also important to understanding disease emergence. The process of disease emergence is usually driven by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15025743451995908019", "cites_id": ["15025743451995908019"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zo7SEf4CldcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA186&dq=info:sydeTg8qhtAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mojaqYsfEr&sig=I-4vftDLyHzKxfwjqg8d7qMud38", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sydeTg8qhtAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 3, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
