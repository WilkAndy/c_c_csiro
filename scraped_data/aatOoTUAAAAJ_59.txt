The viruses are icosahedral with electron-dense cores, each of which IS surrounded by an inner membrane, capsid and a cell-derived envelope. The virus (es) have an average vertex to vertex diameter of 160 nm and replicate in the cytoplasm of a range of cell lines. Wlthin the cytoplasm of infected cells, ra~ ified areas could be observed; structures lacked cellular organelles dnd contained complete, empty and developing viruses. Results from antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with polyclonal antibody raised against epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) indicated crossreactivity between these isolates, Bohle iridovirus (BIV) and frog virus 3 (FV3).
