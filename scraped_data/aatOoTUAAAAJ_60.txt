Gold-labelled monoclonal antibodies to VP7 gave intense labelling with purified BTV core particles and weaker labelling with both directly visualized viral particles, which require no purification, and purified virus particles. It is believed that VP7 is, in a small number of viruses, accessible from the outer surface. The intensity of labelling by anti-VP7 antibodies was markedly increased by treatment of the virus with methanol. Intracellularly, VP7 antibodies also reacted with virus-like particles which appeared to be leaving virus inclusion bodies (VIB), the presumed site of virus synthesis and assembly. These antibodies also reacted with virus-like particles which were bound to the cytoskeleton and did not appear to be virus cores because they also reacted with gold-labelled antibody to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17445980088432859440", "cites_id": ["17445980088432859440"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/0022-1317-69-4-805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MBmUKXWSHPIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 7, "1990": 13, "1991": 6, "1992": 9, "1993": 2, "1994": 9, "1995": 2, "1996": 6, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
