We continued long-term monitoring efforts for the presence of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and for amphibian populations at two sites in western Panama, and we began monitoring at three new sites to the east. Population declines associated with chytridiomycosis emergence were detected at Altos de Campana National Park. We also detected Bd in three species east of the Panama Canal at Soberan\u00eda National Park, and prevalence data suggests that Bd may be enzootic in the lowlands of the park. However, no infected frogs were found further east at Tort\u00ed (prevalence <7.5% with 95% confidence). Our results suggest that Panama\u2019s diverse and not fully described amphibian communities east of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3971091223541574789", "cites_id": ["3971091223541574789"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10393-008-0190-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hezdlW0mHDcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
