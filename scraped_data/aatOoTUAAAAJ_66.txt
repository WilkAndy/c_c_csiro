The antibodies fall into three groups indicating that NS1 contains at least three antigenic sites. One group consists of four antibodies which react solely with cytoskeleton-associated virus-specific tubules. A second group contains one antibody which reacts with cytoskeleton-associated virus particles, released viruses, and purified virus and core particles. Two antibodies constituting a third group react with both tubules and cytoskeleton-associated and released virus particles. NS1 was found in [35S]methionine-labeled, purified virus and core particles. Immunofluorescence tests reveal that those antibodies which react with virus particles also bind to cytoskeleton-associated virus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9148252572346181770", "cites_id": ["9148252572346181770"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288902930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:img_uj4f9X4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 4, "1989": 9, "1990": 8, "1991": 5, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 7, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
