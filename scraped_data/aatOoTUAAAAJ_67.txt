The discovery of the emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, in wild populations of this frog raised concern that this disease may drive the species to extinction. Twelve wild-caught Archey\u2019s frogs naturally infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis were monitored in captivity by observing clinical signs, measuring weight gain, and performing repeated PCR tests. Eight frogs were treated with topical chloramphenicol, without PCR results being available, for B. dendrobatidis at the day of entry of the frog into the trial. Eleven of the 12 frogs (92%) cleared their infection within 3 mo of capture, even though they were held at 15 C and in high humidity, conditions that are ideal for the survival and propagation of B. dendrobatidis. B. dendrobatidis in the remaining frog tested positive for the fungus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11733606433312177360", "cites_id": ["11733606433312177360"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v84/n1/p9-15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0HzPP-Ik1qIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 12, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 8}}
