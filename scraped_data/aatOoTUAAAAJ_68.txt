One recombinant containing a 0.95-kb insertion expressed a sheep parasite antigen from the ovine adenovirus major late promoter and tripartite leader sequences. It was shown that insertions of at least 4.3 kb were tolerated at either one of two sites in the genome without the introduction of a compensating deletion. The unique structure of this viral genome was further emphasized by the discovery that four open reading frames at the right hand end show significant identity to each other but not to other sequences in the databases. Two other unrelated open reading frames were also present. RT-PCR analysis identified two transcripts in this region which were derived from a promoter which was located very close to, or within the ITR sequence. Splicing removed all but the first and last of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13545814058387131340", "cites_id": ["13545814058387131340"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268229798452X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zEuoBx5m_LsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 11, "1999": 8, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
