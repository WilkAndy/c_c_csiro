The fungus infects 2 amphibian orders (Anura and Caudata), 14 families and at least 200 species and is responsible for at least 1 species extinction. Whilst the origin of the agent and routes of transmission are being debated, it has been recognised that successful management of the disease will require effective sampling regimes and detection assays. We have developed a range of unique sampling protocols together with diagnostic assays for the detection of B. dendrobatidis in both living and deceased tadpoles and adults. Here, we formally present our data and discuss them in respect to assay sensitivity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 868, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15648542518163774940", "cites_id": ["15648542518163774940"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v73/n3/p175-192", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3J2_v4LKKtkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 9, "2008": 25, "2009": 30, "2010": 44, "2011": 49, "2012": 47, "2013": 76, "2014": 74, "2015": 58, "2016": 73, "2017": 65, "2018": 69, "2019": 43, "2020": 52, "2021": 73, "2022": 54, "2023": 12}}
