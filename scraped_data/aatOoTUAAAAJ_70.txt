The most distinctive gross lesions of the diseases that developed in three of the horses was that of pulmonary edema characterized by gelatinous distension of subpleural lymphatics. Histologically, the lesions in the lungs were those of serofibrinous alveolar edema, alveolar macrophages, hemorrhage, thrombosis of capillaries, and syncytial cells. Clearly defined vascular lesions in three horses that became clinically affected within 8 days of inoculation of virus included intramural hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis and syncytial cells in the endothelium of pulmonary vessels (\u223c40-70 \u03bcm in diameter).
