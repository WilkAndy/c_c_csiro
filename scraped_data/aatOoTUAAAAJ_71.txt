The causative agent, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, can be highly pathogenic, causing up to 90 to 100 per cent mortality in the postmetamorphic life stages of some amphibian species (Scott 1993, Daszak and others 1999), while other amphibian species appear to be resistant to disease when infected with this fungus (Daszak and others 2004, Weldon and others 2004). B dendrobatidis has low host specificity, infecting at least 14 families and over 100 species of amphibian on five continents. Outbreaks of chytridiomycosis have caused severe population declines and local extinctions in many of these species, and it has been hypothesised that the disease has caused the total extinction of some species (Daszak and others 2003). Clinical signs of the disease include lethargy, loss of the righting reflex and abnormal posture. Gross lesions are usually not apparent, but increased epidermal sloughing, epidermal ulceration and reddening (hyperaemia) of the digital and ventral skin have been reported (Daszak and others 1999, Berger and others 2000).The primary hypothesis for the emergence of amphibian population declines caused by chytrid fungus is the exposure of naive host populations to a newly introduced pathogen, although other hypotheses, such as a change in a pre-existing host-pathogen relationship, have not yet been discounted (Cunningham and others 2003, Weldon and others 2004).
