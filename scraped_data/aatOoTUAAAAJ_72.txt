The syndromes, characterized by skin ulceration or systemic haemorrhages, were induced upon exposure to lesion homogenates or cultured ranavirus. The re-isolation of ranavirus from experimentally affected frogs fulfilled Koch's postulates. Aeromonas hydrophila, previously associated with similar lesions, was not significant to disease development. Unexpectedly, disease outcomes were influenced by both the source of agent and the route of exposure, indicating that different ranaviruses with different tissue tropisms and pathogeneses (possibly similar to quasi-species in RNA virus populations) are circulating in the British common frog population. Our findings confirm that ranavirus disease has emerged as an important \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10778073517674406329", "cites_id": ["10778073517674406329"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/emerging-epidemic-diseases-of-frogs-in-britain-are-dependent-on-the-source-of-ranavirus-agent-and-the-route-of-exposure/1858D1D1A4CA36B30EB86BAE16DF75B3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uSEHeMJok5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
