Two sheep and 4 rabbits were inoculated with homogenized whole culture of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Freund\u00b9s complete adjuvant or triple adjuvant. Antisera from all animals reacted strongly with all stages of B. dendrobatidis and stained the walls, cytoplasm, rhizoids and zoospores in an indirect immunoperoxidase test. Significant cross-reactivity occurred only with some fungi in the Chytridiomycota, and there are no members of this phylum besides B. dendrobatidis that infect frogs. The immunoperoxidase stain is a useful screening test when combined with recognition of the morphology and infection site of B. dendrobatidis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8669784887270007611", "cites_id": ["8669784887270007611"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v48/n3/p213-220/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O2PHpGtDUXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 7, "2005": 5, "2006": 10, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5}}
