The mortalities spread rapidly both with and against currents and usually affected flsh longer than 11 cm. Examination showed mortalities to be associated with the presence of replicating herpesvirus in the gill epithelium; herpesviruses were not observed w~ thin equivalent cells of unaffected fish collected ahead of the mortality front. By negative contrast electron microscopy the virus was demonstrated to possess a 96 nm icosahedral caps~ d containing 162 capsomers. Many virions were enveloped and possessed surface projections. The nuclei of infected epithelia1 cells contained nucleoids, capsids and nucleocapsids which were released from the nucleus into the surrounding cytoplasm following degeneration of the nuclear mcmbrane.
