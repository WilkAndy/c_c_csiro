Examination of the BTV-infected cell surface revealed that viruses are released both as enveloped particles, by budding through the plasma membrane, and as nonenveloped particles by \u201cextrusion\u201d through the membrane. Particles being released and those remaining on the cell surface retain an association with the cortical layer of the cytoskeleton. Analyses of virus particles released from infected cells and the intracellular viruses in the cytosol and attached to the cytoskeleton indicate that although the three populations have similar particle to infectivity ratios they differ in their ability to bind gold-labeled anti-VP2 antibody. The fact that released viruses bind less antibody than intracellular viruses suggests that virus release \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18008373475801816429", "cites_id": ["18008373475801816429"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289902183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bd27h0OY6vkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
