Bohle iridovirus was isolated from ornate burrowing frogs (Limnodynastes ornatus). The viruses differed in cytopathic effect, site of virus release, molecular weight of proteins, and restriction endonuclease digest profiles of their respective DNA. Both were capable of infecting a similar range of cell cultures, had similar ultrastructural features and possessed proteins of similar antigenic reactivity. Haematopoietic necrosis virus was evidently related to the ranavirus genus of iridovirus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12637572324273053074", "cites_id": ["12637572324273053074"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19932233120", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kl2aexKtYa8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 2, "2004": 8, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
