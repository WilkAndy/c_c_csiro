This virus caused an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and humans. Genetic analyses show it to be only distantly related to the classic morbilliviruses rinderpest, measles, and canine distemper. When seen by electron microscopy, viruses had 10- and 18-nanometer surface projections that gave them a \"double-fringed\" appearance. The virus induced syncytia that developed in the endothelium of blood vessels, particularly the lungs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 853, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=61647529355214265", "cites_id": ["61647529355214265"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.7701348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uX1_8BkE2wAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 6, "1996": 21, "1997": 16, "1998": 16, "1999": 26, "2000": 28, "2001": 35, "2002": 26, "2003": 23, "2004": 38, "2005": 28, "2006": 27, "2007": 37, "2008": 30, "2009": 41, "2010": 26, "2011": 39, "2012": 49, "2013": 52, "2014": 29, "2015": 35, "2016": 32, "2017": 23, "2018": 31, "2019": 27, "2020": 26, "2021": 34, "2022": 25, "2023": 12}}
