It is also shown that EHNV may be moved between river systems and impoundments by birds. The transfer may be by regurgitation of infected fish, or by mechanical transfer on feathers, feet or the bill. The virus may also be transferred by the intentional movement of live or dead fish by anglers, by mechanical transfer on boats, nets and other equipment, by flowing water, or by migrating infected fish."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14238866039560064648", "cites_id": ["14238866039560064648"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19962210762", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iM5Z5DidmsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
