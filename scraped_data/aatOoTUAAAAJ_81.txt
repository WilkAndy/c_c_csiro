The BroV genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments, each having a 3\u2032 terminal pentanucleotide sequence conserved amongst all members of the genus Orthoreovirus, and a unique 5\u2032 terminal pentanucleotide sequence. The smallest genome segment is bicistronic and encodes two small nonstructural proteins, one of which is a novel fusion associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein responsible for syncytium formation, but no cell attachment protein. The low amino acid sequence identity between BroV proteins and those of other orthoreoviruses (13\u201350%), combined with phylogenetic analyses of structural and nonstructural proteins provide evidence to support the classification of BroV in a new sixth species group within the genus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12713727831396311336", "cites_id": ["12713727831396311336"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209007843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KOFfORo8cLAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
