The susceptibility to chytridiomycosis and the severity of epidermal lesions in amphibians with chytridiomycosis are not consistent across species or even among individuals. Severe infections cause death of the animal most likely through disturbance of ion homeostasis. The mechanism by which this superficial skin infection results in epidermal lesions has so far eluded precise definition. It was the aim of this study to unravel how B. dendrobatidis causes alterations that affect skin integrity. Exposure of Xenopus laevis skin to B. dendrobatidis zoospore supernatant using skin explants and Ussing chambers caused rapid disruption of intercellular junctions, demonstrated using histology and transmission electron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8000555969361897310", "cites_id": ["8000555969361897310"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184512001351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xmdy70OvB28J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 11, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
