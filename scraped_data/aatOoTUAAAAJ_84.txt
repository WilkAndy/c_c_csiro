EHNV, ESV and ECV are recognized causative agents of the OIE (Office International des Epizooties) notifiable systemic necrotizing iridovirus syndrome and are currently identified by protein\u2010based assays, none of which are able to rapidly identify the specific agents. The aim of this study was to develop TaqMan real\u2010time PCR assays that differentiated these viruses using nucleotide sequence variation in two ranavirus genes. A conserved probe representing 100% sequence homology was used as a reference for virus\u2010specific probes. The virus\u2010specific probes produced a similar signal level to the conserved probe while those probes binding to non\u2010target viral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5627088220940878848", "cites_id": ["5627088220940878848"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2007.00828.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AET3YOxuF04J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
