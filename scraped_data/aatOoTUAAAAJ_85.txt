MAbs V-3-2B and Y-18 were specific to gp116 and gp64 envelope proteins, respectively, while Y-19 was specific to a 20 kDa putative nucleoprotein p20. As a preliminary step, the site of reactivity of the 3 MAbs in YHV was determined by immuno-electron microscopy using ultra-thin sections of YHV-infected shrimp tissue and negatively stained, semi-purified YHV particles. As expected, MAb Y-19 reacted with viral nucleocapsids in ultra-thin sections but not with negatively stained, whole virions; MAb V-3-2B did react with negatively stained, whole virions, but not with virions or nucleocapsids in ultra-thin sections. Unexpectedly, MAb Y-18 did not react with whole or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=341220080458353496", "cites_id": ["341220080458353496"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v57/n3/p193-200/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WEvz9dpBvAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 8, "2008": 6, "2009": 11, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
