Rana pipiens were harvested on the order of 100,000 specimens per year in the early 1980s in Quebec (Gilbert et al. 1994) and 100,000 pounds per year in the early 1970s in Minnesota (Moriarty 1998). Carey et al.(1999) suggested that population declines observed in this species in the late 1960s or early 1970s in some areas (Gibbs et al. 1971; Rorabaugh 2005) may have been caused by the emergence of chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by infection with the fungus"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12128893433590369259", "cites_id": ["12128893433590369259"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Hyatt/publication/254834760_The_Northern_Leopard_Frog_Rana_pipiens_is_a_Widespread_Reservoir_Species_Harboring_Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis_in_North_America/links/550749290cf27e990e059677/The-Northern-Leopard-Frog-Rana-pipiens-is-a-Widespread-Reservoir-Species-Harboring-Batrachochytrium-dendrobatidis-in-North-America.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:68u481B8UqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
