The isolate grows readily in a range of fish cell lines including CHSE-214, RTG-2 and BF-2 and is neutralised by a pan-specific rabbit antiserum raised against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) Ab strain and by a commercial pan-specific IPNV-neutralising monoclonal antibody. Presence of the virus was not associated with gross clinical signs. Histopathological examination revealed a range of lesions particularly in pancreatic tissue. The virus was localised in pancreas sections by immunoperoxidase staining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12197177410485912980", "cites_id": ["12197177410485912980"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v43/n1/p1-14/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lIVuPjsURakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
