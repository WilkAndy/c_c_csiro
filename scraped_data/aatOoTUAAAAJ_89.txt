The ultrastructure of the virus and the intracellular virus-specific structures are characteristic for the family Paramyxoviridae. Cytoplasmic nucleocapsids were observed within the infected cells monolayers, endothelial cells (lung) of infected horses and the neurons within the brain of the 36 year old Queensland man. Aggregates of smaller nucleocapsid-like structures were also observed within the brain of the same man; these did not react with sera from recovered EMV-infected horses or from a recovered EMV-infected human. Co-examination of rinderpest virus (RPV), bovine parainfluenza-3 (BPIV-3), human respiratory virus (HRSV) and Sendai virus revealed that their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5213775453802063961", "cites_id": ["5213775453802063961"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016817029601307X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WeiFxiYNW0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 8, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
