However, the origin of this virulent pathogen is unknown. A survey was conducted of 697 archived specimens of 3 species of Xenopus collected from 1879 to 1999 in southern Africa in which the histologic features of the interdigital webbing were analyzed. The earliest case of chytridiomycosis found was in a Xenopus laevis frog in 1938, and overall prevalence was 2.7%. The prevalence showed no significant differences between species, regions, season, or time period. Chytridiomycosis was a stable endemic infection in southern Africa for 23 years before any positive specimen was found outside Africa. We propose that Africa is the origin of the amphibian chytrid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 722, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18394435988907059739", "cites_id": ["18394435988907059739"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323396/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G2p38hIqRv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 21, "2006": 31, "2007": 32, "2008": 42, "2009": 44, "2010": 63, "2011": 57, "2012": 48, "2013": 51, "2014": 54, "2015": 38, "2016": 46, "2017": 37, "2018": 23, "2019": 25, "2020": 24, "2021": 33, "2022": 20, "2023": 7}}
