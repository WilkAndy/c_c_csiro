Sera contaming antibodies against'ranaviruses' were found in both countries. In Australia positive antibodies were identified in populations throughout most of the known range of B. rnarinus. Results were confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy where a characteristic stalning pattern of'ranaviruses' in infected cells was observed. Whilst a'ranavirus (es)'has been isolated from populations of B. rnarinus in Venezuela, no virus has been isolated from Australian B. marinus populations. The significance of'ranavirus' sero-positive B. marinus in Australia is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17025496298232061465", "cites_id": ["17025496298232061465"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v32/n1/p1-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GZ7ZpK22RuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4}}
