Pleuropedal ganglia, pedal nerve cords, head and epipodial tissue was collected and homogenized from abalone populations exhibiting high mortality and clinical signs consistent with herpes-virus like ganglioneuritis. Following ultracentrifugation by sucrose gradient prepared in sea-water, the purified virus was negatively stained and examined under a transmission electron microscope. Virus particles were observed to have an icosahedral capsid appearance surrounded by an envelope with numerous spikes on the external surface. The capsid ranged 92\u2013109nm in diameter and the enveloped virus was approximately 150nm in diameter. Virus particles were found mainly at the interface of 40\u201350% sucrose gradients, and a few presented at the interface of 50\u201360% sucrose gradients.
