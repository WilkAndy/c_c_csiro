Design and procedures Laboratory examinations were made of eyes and brains of a large number of kangaroos using serological, virological, histopathological, electron microscopical, immunohistochemical methods, and PCR with cDNA sequencing. In addition, potential insect viral vectors identified during the disease outbreak were examined for specific viral genomic sequences. Sample population For histopathological analysis, 55 apparently blind and 18 apparently normal wild kangaroos and wallabies were obtained from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. A total of 437 wild kangaroos and wallabies (including 23 animals with apparent blindness) were examined serologically. Results Orbiviruses of the Wallal and Warrego serogroups were isolated from kangaroos affected with blindness in a major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12093076271338388295", "cites_id": ["12093076271338388295"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1999.tb12126.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R3vUAsw806cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
