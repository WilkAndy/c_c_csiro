It was deliberately introduced into Australia's tropical north\u2010east in 1935 in an unsuccessful attempt to control the cane beetle, a damaging insect pest of sugarcane crops. The toads quickly established in the new environment and began to spread. Today, they inhabit most of the Australian tropics and sub\u2010tropics and have reached Western Australia. Models predict that global warming will enable the toads to extend their range further south. They cause severe environmental impacts, as all life stages of B. marinus contain bufadienolides, alkaloid substances toxic to vertebrates, resulting in death of the predators ingesting it. The continental scale of this biological invasion in combination with the remoteness of the areas affected, poses a specific set of challenges to potential control approaches for cane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5758122792536747431", "cites_id": ["5758122792536747431"], "pub_url": "https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2009.00319.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p607Biz26E8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
