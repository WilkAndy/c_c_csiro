Monospecific antibodies generated to vaccinia virus-expressed VP7 and an anti-VP7 monoclonal antibody (MAb 20E9) bound to native virus particles and were localized by protein A-gold. In contrast, MAb 20E9 labeled directly with gold failed to gain access and bind, suggesting that VP7 is neither adventitiously adsorbed to the virion surface nor exposed in a manner such as protrusion through the outer capsid. Thus the surface layer of BTV may be considered as a net which only partially obscures the underlying core particle. Sequencing of VP7 revealed it to be an extremely hydrophobic protein, 350 amino acids in length with cysteine residues at positions 15, 65, and 154. Examination of VP7 in the cytosol of cells infected with either BTV or a vaccinia virus recombinant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5449396710052209491", "cites_id": ["5449396710052209491"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190082M", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UyPYhm8loEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 7, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
