Both proteins were detected in lysates of rVV-infected cells by labelling with d-[6-3H]glucosamine or by immuno-blotting. The recombinant G protein (mol. mass 79 kDa) appeared slightly smaller than the native G protein but reacted with monoclonal antibodies directed against all defined neutralizing antigenic sites (G1, G2, G3a, G3b and G4). The recombinant GNS protein (mol. mass 90 kDa) was identical in size to the native GNS protein and failed to react by immunofluorescence with anti-G protein monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Antisera raised in rabbits against rVV-G or rVV-GNS both reacted strongly by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy with BEFV-infected cells. The G protein was localized intracellularly in the endoplasmic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=312527666830582595", "cites_id": ["312527666830582595"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/0022-1317-77-4-631", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QyPr00FSVgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
