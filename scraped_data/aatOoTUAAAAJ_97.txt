On the basis of virion size, icosahedral morphology and ultrastructural characteristics of virus\u2010infected cells, EHNV was designated as an iridovirus. The following observations outlined in this paper confirm the designation: (1) The number and complexity of proteins in purified EHNV and the ordered appearance of virus\u2010specific proteins in infected cells are similar to that described for the iridovirus, frog virus 3 (FV3). (2) EHNV isolated from the cytoplasm of infected cells contains a lipid membrane associated with 7\u20139 nm capsomeric subunits containing a 52\u2010kD protein. (3) The morphogenesis of EHNV within cytoplasmic inclusion bodies resembles that of FV3 and a piscine iridovirus isolated from goldfish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "aatOoTUAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3646852099018594868", "cites_id": ["3646852099018594868"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2761.1991.tb00586.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NBpkhqk4nDIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
