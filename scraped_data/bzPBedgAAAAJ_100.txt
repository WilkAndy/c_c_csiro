A range of sterols (C26-C30) were detected in the sea-ice diatom communities; 24-methylenecholesterol, brassicasterol and 24-ethylcholesterol were the major sterols at the Cape Armitage, Erebus, Cape Evans and Wohlschlag Bay sites. The similarity of the sterol profiles to those observed in previous studies of Antarctic freshwater algal communities strongly indicates that diatoms, rather than cyanobacteria or other algal groups previously proposed, are a more probable source of C29 sterols in these extreme environments. Two novel 4-methyl-C30 sterols were also detected: a C30 sterol showing a similar mass spectrum to 4-methyl-24-ethyl-5\u03b1-cholest-22-en-3\u03b2-ol derived from the prymnesiophyte microalga \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14681075941964343678", "cites_id": ["14681075941964343678"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014663809090096I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fmlRGcmovcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 6}}
