Artemia were enriched on one of five experimental emulsions that contained graduated concentrations of DHA and constant 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid, ARA). We also compared larval performance using a commercial enrichment product high in n-3 PUFA. Final DHA concentrations in Artemia enriched on the experimental emulsions ranged from 0.1\u201320.8 mg/g DM, while Artemia fed the commercial product had 18.2 mg DHA/g DM. Each of the six diets was fed to larvae in four replicate 300-l tanks. Standard length (range 10.0\u201311.2 mm) and dry weight (range 1.6\u20132.5 mg) of larvae at the end of the experiment were directly related to dietary DHA, with the highest growth recorded in the experimental diet with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1204466778004386058", "cites_id": ["1204466778004386058"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848604006167", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CvG1LicgtxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
