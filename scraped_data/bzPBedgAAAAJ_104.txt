Sterol and fatty acid profiles do not support theseparation of Chattonella antiqua and C.marina as distinct species. Ecophenotypic variations in lipidprofiles were also observed between Chattonella strainsfromdifferent geographic locations. Sterol signatures which may be useful aschemotaxonomic markers were: the absence of C27 sterols (cholesteroland 24-dihydrozymosterol) in Heterosigma akashiwo; thepresence of isofucosterol in Chattonella; and theoccurrence of brassicasterol, poriferasterol and fucosterol inOlisthodiscus luteus. High levels of eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA; 17-27% of fatty acids) were present in all raphidophyte species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8878291751140004656", "cites_id": ["8878291751140004656"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021101203543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MBP79k4HNnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
