The fresh leaves of P. australis and P. australis detritus are characterized by a distinctive distribution of solvent-extractable long-chain monocarboxylic, \u03b1, \u03c9-dicarboxylic and \u03c9-hydroxy acids. This distinctive pattern should enable these lipid components along with other distinctive components to be used as chemical markers of the seagrass P. australis. H. tasmanica is characterized by (1) higher relative concentrations of 16:2\u03c96 and 16:3\u03c93 than P. australis, (2) the absence of the distinctive distribution pattern of long-chain monocarboxylic and \u03c9-hydroxy acids observed for P. australis, (3) the absence of \u03b1, \u03c9-diacids and (4) a lower absolute concentration of \u03c9-hydroxy acids than P. australis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=448727990845430565", "cites_id": ["448727990845430565"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942282850279", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jdsd77ozOgYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 6, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
