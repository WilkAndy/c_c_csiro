Lipid is critical in the nutrition of larval crustaceans, including lobsters. Specimens were from Tasmanian waters, Australia, and North Island, New Zealand, waters. Analyses were by TLC-FID and capillary GC and GC-MS. Phyllosoma larvae and nektonic pueruli were low in storage lipid (triacylglycerol), and phospholipid was the major lipid class. Sterol, mainly cholesterol, was the next most abundant class. The ratio of the essential omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) was lower in newly hatched phyllosomas (1.2\u20131.3) than in other phyllosomas (stages III\u2013XI; 2.8\u20136.7) and pueruli (3.8).
