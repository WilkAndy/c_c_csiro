Total lipid was low in all zooplankton (0.1\u20135 mg g\u22121 wet mass) and included primarily polar lipids (59\u201396% of total lipid). Triacylglycerols were 0\u201326% of total lipids, and wax esters were 0\u201311% in all species. Cholesterol was the major sterol in all Cnidaria (50\u201363% of total sterols) whereas in most ctenophores it was lower at 26\u201345%. These cholesterol levels are consistent with a combined carnivorous and phytoplanktivorous diet in the ctenophores, with the carnivorous diet more dominant in the Cnidaria. Other sterols included primarily trans \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12295436353814606442", "cites_id": ["12295436353814606442"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11745-000-555-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ajKLQzgqoqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 4, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
