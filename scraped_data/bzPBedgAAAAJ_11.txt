Recent studies have shown that some thraustochytrid strains can be cultured to produce high biomass, containing substantial amounts of lipid rich in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). It is also evident that cell yield and PUFA production by some thraustochytrid strains can be varied by manipulation of physical and chemical parameters of the culture. At present, fish oils and cultured phototrophic microalgae are the main commercial sources of PUFA. The possible decline of commercial fish stocks and the relatively complex technology required to commercially produce microalgae have prompted research into possible alternative sources of PUFA. The culture of thraustochytrids and other PUFA-producing microheterotrophs is seen as one such alternative. Indeed, several thraustochytrid-based products are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 295, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11733841980475973352", "cites_id": ["11733841980475973352"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00011813", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6B7W2Bz71qIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 9, "2002": 8, "2003": 10, "2004": 5, "2005": 15, "2006": 11, "2007": 18, "2008": 11, "2009": 11, "2010": 14, "2011": 13, "2012": 14, "2013": 22, "2014": 17, "2015": 19, "2016": 15, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
