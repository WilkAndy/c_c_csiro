Its closest relatives included representatives of the Hydrocarboniphaga-Nevskia-Sinobacter clade (<92% sequence similarity) in the family Sinobacteraceae. The strain exhibited a narrow nutritional spectrum, preferring to utilize aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and small organic acids. Notably, it displayed versatility in degrading two- and three-ring PAHs. Moreover, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity was detected in lysates, indicating that this strain utilizes the meta-cleavage pathway for aromatic compound \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10368477466088605167", "cites_id": ["10368477466088605167"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.02833-12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:74XaI1I75I8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
