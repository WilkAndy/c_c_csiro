However, the precise ichthyotoxic mechanism by this paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) \u2013 producing dinoflagellate remains poorly understood. The rainbow trout cell line RTgill-W1 assay was used to investigate fish gill damage by multiple A. catenella strains under different environmental conditions, and potency of whole cells, lysed cells and culture medium were compared. Cytotoxic potency was highly variable among strains and strongly correlated to dinoflagellate cell-abundance. Lysed cells produced more gill damage than intact cells and supernatant, reducing gill cell viability down to 20% of controls at 4000 cells mL\u22121. However, gill cells exposed to pure PST fractions (C1&C2, STX, GTX 1&4) exhibited only very limited loss of viability (<30%), even at cell concentrations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1384312596459123879", "cites_id": ["1384312596459123879"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988315001304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p3QL2vgQNhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
