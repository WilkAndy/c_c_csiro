Mortality was significantly higher for reproductive males (100%, n=68) than for females (3%, n=186) within the first 3 d of capture. Total lipid and triacylglycerol levels in male, female and juvenile Euphausia superba were analysed and compared. All reproductive male krill analysed from this swarm had low lipid levels (1 to 3% dry weight) with negligible triacylglycerol stores (0 to 2% of total lipid). Somatic lipid stores in female and juvenile krill ranged from 8 to 30% of which up to 40% was triacylglycerol. The levels of algal sterols in the digestive gland of males, females and juveniles indicate that all krill had been feeding recently. An analysis of the sex ratio of krill catches derived from data collected over seven summers from the Prydz Bay region showed a decrease in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15135675082112052225", "cites_id": ["15135675082112052225"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00354634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ASwFgUu4DNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 12, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
