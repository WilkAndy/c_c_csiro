Microbial biomass, calculated from phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations to be 5.6 \u00d7 109 bacteria/g (dry weight), was greater in the hydrocarbon\u2010degrading column than in either an azide\u2010inhibited soil column or an untreated surface soil. Microbial community structure information, using GC\u2010MS analysis of derivatized monounsaturated PLFA, indicated that the major component (16 to 28%) of the PLFA in the hydrocarbon\u2010degrading column was the PLFA 18:1\u03b410c. This novel PLFA has been reported as a major component in type II methanotrophs. The high relative proportions of C18 components relative to C16 fatty acids indicated that type II rather \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15272339575173806429", "cites_id": ["15272339575173806429"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5620060203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XflfY-0_8tMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
