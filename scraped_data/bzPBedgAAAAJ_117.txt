The fish, fed a commercial diet, were held at an elevated water temperature of 19\u00b0C. Total n\u20103 PUFA, total PUFA, and n\u20103/n\u20106 and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid (UFA/SFA) ratios in the FA profile of the total lipid extract in the white muscle were fairly low compared with fish grown at 15\u00b0C. Adaptation of structural and storage lipids at elevated temperatures was shown by a significant (P<0.01) reduction in PUFA especially in the percentage of EPA (6\u20138%). Further adaptation was indicated by the percentages of SFA, which were significantly (P<0.05) higher in gill (56%) and white muscle (58%) polar lipid fractions and coincided with lower percentages of n\u20103, n\u20106, and total PUFA.
