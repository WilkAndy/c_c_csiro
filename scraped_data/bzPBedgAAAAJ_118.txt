The three long-chain (\u2265C20) n-3 PUFA (n-3 LC-PUFA), EPA, DHA, and DPA play an important role in human health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Up to the present time, seafood, and in particular, fish oil-derived products, have been the richest sources of n-3 LC-PUFA. The human diet generally contains insufficient amounts of these essential FA due largely to the low consumption of seafood. This issue provides opportunities to enrich the content of n-3 PUFA in other common food groups. Milk and milk products have traditionally been a major component of human diets, but are also among some of the poorest sources of n-3 PUFA. Consideration of the high consumption of milk and its processed products worldwide and the human health benefits has led to a large number of studies targeting the enhancement of n-3 PUFA content in dairy products. The main objective of this review was to evaluate the major strategies that have been employed to enhance n-3 PUFA content in dairy products and to unravel potential knowledge gaps for further research on this topic. Nutritional manipulation to date has been the main approach for altering milk fatty acids (FA) in ruminants. However, the main challenge is ruminal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:xa5BkEQK8BgC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6848713892562698981", "cites_id": ["6848713892562698981"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/436850", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5YJ7zv-EC18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 19, "2021": 32, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
