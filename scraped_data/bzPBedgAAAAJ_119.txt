The level of individual fatty acids and sterols was also affected by metal treatment with significant decreases in the major polyunsaturated fatty acids 20:5\u03945,8,11,14,17, 16:1\u03949 and 16:3\u03943,6,9 in PCMB-treated, and 20:5\u03945,8,11,14,17 in cadmium-treated cells; increased cholest-5-en-3\u03b2-ol, particularly in PCMB-treated cells; and a decrease in the ratio of 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3\u03b2-ol to 24-ethylcholesta-5,24(28)Z-dien-3\u03b2-ol which was most notable in cadmium-treated cells. These results can be explained in terms of the formation of mercury and cadmium complexes with thiol-containing enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, and thus provide further support \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14230068228048889001", "cites_id": ["14230068228048889001"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200818099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qSRtxqhbe8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 4, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 6, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
