While TAG typically accumulates in seeds as storage compounds fuelling subsequent germination, levels in vegetative tissues are generally low. Here, we report the accumulation of more than 15% TAG (17.7% total lipids) by dry weight in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) leaves by the co\u2010expression of three genes involved in different aspects of TAG production without severely impacting plant development. These yields far exceed the levels found in wild\u2010type leaf tissue as well as previously reported engineered TAG yields in vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana and N. tabacum. When translated to a high biomass crop, the current levels would translate to an oil yield per hectare that exceeds those of most cultivated oilseed crops \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC", "num_citations": 294, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1916186929334276250", "cites_id": ["1916186929334276250"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12131", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mlA3HtyplxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 25, "2015": 23, "2016": 44, "2017": 32, "2018": 28, "2019": 27, "2020": 34, "2021": 40, "2022": 30, "2023": 9}}
