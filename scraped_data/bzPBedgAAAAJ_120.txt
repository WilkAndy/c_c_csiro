An increase in microbial biomass, based on phospholipid ester-linked fatty acids (PLFA), was apparent for the natural gas-enriched column relative to a control column and untreated surface soil. Following GC-MS analyses of the derivatized monounsaturated fatty acids, the major component (22% of the PLFA) of the natural gas-enriched column was identified as 18\u00b71\u0394 10c. This relatively novel fatty acid has only been previously reported as a major component in methanotrophs. Its presence in the soil, together with other supportive evidence, implies that this microbial metabolic group makes a large contribution to the column flora. Other microbial groups were also recognized and differences compared between the soils analysed.
