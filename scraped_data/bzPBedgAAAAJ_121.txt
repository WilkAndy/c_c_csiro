The validation of genes driven by seed-specific promoters is time-consuming since the transformed plants must be grown to maturity before the gene function can be analysed.In this study we demonstrate that genes driven by seed-specific promoters contained within complex constructs can be transiently-expressed in the Nicotiana benthamiana leaf-assay system by co-infiltrating the Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) gene. A real-world case study is described in which we first assembled an efficient transgenic DHA synthesis pathway using a traditional N. benthamiana Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S-driven leaf assay before using the LEC2-extended assay to rapidly validate a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18446664861054757489", "cites_id": ["18446664861054757489"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1746-4811-6-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cWrZ3fS3__8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 6}}
