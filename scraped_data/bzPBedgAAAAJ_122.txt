Some of them are frequently caught as by\u2010catch of tuna and other fishes. The most noteworthy ones include escolar and oilfish. The accumulation of the indigestible wax esters in the rectum through consumption of these fish engenders discharges or leakage per rectum as orange or brownish green oil, but without noticeable loss of water. This physiological response is called keriorrhea, which is variously described as \u201coily diarrhea,\u201d \u201coily orange diarrhea,\u201d or \u201corange oily leakage\u201d by the mass media and bloggers on the internet. Outbreaks of keriorrhea have been repeatedly reported across continents. Additional symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea were complained by the victims. They are probably due to anxiety or panic when suffering from keriorrhea. Escolar and oilfish are banned \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=953907592000597225", "cites_id": ["953907592000597225"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043452609570015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Wy-oeb1PA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 21, "2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
