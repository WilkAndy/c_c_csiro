The lipid class, fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition differed markedly in each tissue and in each species. The lipid and fatty acid composition of large, lipid-rich (38\u201370% wet weight, ww) livers demonstrated the multifunctional role of this organ in: lipid distribution, storage and biosynthesis, and buoyancy regulation. In the liver, the importance of certain lipids (including squalene, diacylglyceryl ethers, triacylglycerols and to a lesser extent wax esters) as mediators of buoyancy varied according to lifestyle and habitat. Less variability was observed in the muscle profiles, characterized by low lipid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14563195459844690501", "cites_id": ["14563195459844690501"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-010-1416-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RdKfkhzdGsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 11, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
