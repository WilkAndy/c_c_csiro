They provide versatile signatures that are being increasingly employed to delineate the transfer of dietary material through marine and terrestrial food webs. The standard procedure for determining fatty acids generally involves lipid extraction followed by methanolysis to produce methyl esters for analysis by gas chromatography. By directly transmethylating ~50 mg wet samples and adding an internal standard it was possible to greatly simplify the analytical methodology to enable rapid throughput of 20\u201340 fish tissue fatty acid analyses a day including instrumental analysis. This method was verified against the more traditional lipid methods using albacore tuna and great white shark muscle and liver samples, and it was shown to provide an estimate of sample dry mass, total lipid content, and a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3749646746891682760", "cites_id": ["3749646746891682760"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-014-3131-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yIOtjdlrCTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
