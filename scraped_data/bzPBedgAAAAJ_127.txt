Aliphatic hydrocarbon levels in sea-ice algae were 1.9\u201312.5 mg m\u22122 and in seawater particulate matter 0.07\u20130.17 \u03bcg l\u22121. Sea-ice algae contained the diatom biomarker, the highly branched isoprenoid (ip) diene ipC25:2, and Southern Ocean seawater particulate matter samples were distinguished from near shore samples by the presence of nC21:6. Sea-ice algae and seawater particulate matter samples showed a predominance of even chain n-alkanes. Hydrocarbon levels in sediment samples from anoxic fjord basins were high (45\u201348 \u03bcg g\u22121) compared to a sub-tidal marine sample (0.7 \u03bcg g\u22121), and were predominantly of bacterial origin. Contaminants detected were linear alkyl benzenes in sewage effluent from Davis station, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7223779003793377715", "cites_id": ["7223779003793377715"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0025326X9290685Y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s4kHEbsEQGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
