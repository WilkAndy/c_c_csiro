Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, the strain was most closely related to Porticoccus litoralis IMCC2115T (96.5%) and to members of the genera Microbulbifer (91.4 to 93.7%) and Marinimicrobium (90.4 to 92.0%). Phylogenetic trees showed that the strain clustered in a distinct phyletic line in the class Gammaproteobacteria for which P. litoralis is presently the sole cultured representative. The strain was strictly aerobic, rod shaped, Gram negative, and halophilic. Notably, it was able to utilize hydrocarbons as sole sources of carbon and energy, whereas sugars did not serve as growth substrates. The predominant isoprenoid quinone of strain MCTG13d was Q-8, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15943142423180696459", "cites_id": ["15943142423180696459"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.06398-11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i1slQZBrQd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
