In Experiment 1, Artemia were enriched for up to 36 h with the diatom Chaetoceros muelleri, the chromist Schizochytrium (Algamac 3050\u00ae) or a squid oil emulsion. In Experiment 2, Artemia were enriched with the same diets for 6 h, and then starved for 24 h at 4, 18 or 28 \u00b0C. Artemia did not survive beyond 24 h enrichment on Algamac and survival was low on oil emulsion, contrasting with the rapid growth and high survival on C. muelleri. Fatty acid (FA) content of Artemia increased marginally after enrichment with C. muelleri, with a marked increase over 36 h enrichment in the percent long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LC-PUFA). FA content increased by 60% and 140% after enrichment with Algamac and squid oil emulsion, respectively, and %LC-PUFA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15423447455244893545", "cites_id": ["15423447455244893545"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848604003667", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aT3GXb4XC9YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
