The workshop provided a second international forum to present the current state of research and new directions since the last Southern Ocean cephalopod meeting held in 1993. A major focus of the workshop was trophic ecology and the use of a variety of tools that can be applied in Southern Ocean trophic studies for both cephalopod and predator researchers. New tools that are being used as trophic indicators and tracers in food chain pathways include stable isotope, heavy metal and fatty acid signature analysis. Progress is also being made on understanding squid population dynamics in relation to other key components of the ecosystem by incorporating squid data in ecosystem models.
