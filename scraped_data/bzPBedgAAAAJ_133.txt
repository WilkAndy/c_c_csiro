Pure cultures (JP2 and JP3) were obtained from mixed culture enrichments and were characterised and tested for their bioleaching ability. All cultures possessed Sulfolobus-like morphology, and the presence of distinctive cyclized tetraether lipids. The two pure cultures were identified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences as being most closely related to Sulfolobus solfataricus. Each isolate was able to oxidise both Fe2+ and sulphur, and grow on both pyrite and chalcopyrite under autotrophic conditions. Leaching experiments showed that the isolates were capable of rapidly leaching a chalcopyrite concentrate (up to 91% Cu release in 108 h). Optimal temperatures for growth and chalcopyrite leaching were determined for each strain.
