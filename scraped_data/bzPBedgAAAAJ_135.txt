The major lipid classes in all samples were polar lipids (including phospholipid, glycolipid and chlorophyll) and triacylglycerol, with lesser proportions of free fatty acids. Total lipid increased through November and early December, reaching a maximum (3300 mg m\u22122 at Cape Armitage and 1800 mg m\u22122 at Erebus Ice Tongue) c. one week after the chlorophyll a maxima. This increase was largely attributable to a corresponding increase in triacylglycerol. At the lipid maxima, triacylglycerol/polar lipid ratios in the range 1.0 to 2.5 were observed. The dynamic variations in lipid class abundances indicate that profound changes in the physiology of sea-ice diatoms are occurring throughout the spring bloom.
