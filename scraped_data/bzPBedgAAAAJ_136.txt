Total fatty acid (TFA) concentrations varied considerably (between 0.6 and 7.8 in % of dry weight (DW)) between species, with on average the highest concentrations being in the Phaeophyceae, then the Chlorophyta, and with the Rhodophyta recording the lowest average concentrations. Results revealed significant differences in the fatty acid profiles of the three algal groups. Most species exhibit high proportions of PUFA in their fatty acid profile and a low ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA. These properties highlight the potential for southern-Australian macroalgae to be used for these FA in food, animal feed and nutraceutical applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:d4tt_xEv1X8C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2008245298580552082", "cites_id": ["2008245298580552082"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814618308598", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kvm9e3W43hsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
