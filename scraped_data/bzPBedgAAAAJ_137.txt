The burrow walls had a similar organic carbon content to that of the surrounding sediment, a result which was consistent with their lack of a discrete mucous lining. Burrow walls, however, were lined with compacted and smoothed sediment and were coloured a distinct light yellow/brown compared with the dark grey of the surrounding subsurface sediments. Moderately reducing redox conditions were found in both the burrow wall and surface sediment (means 213mV and 243mV, respectively), indicative of a burrow environment regularly flushed with overlying water by the resident shrimp.
