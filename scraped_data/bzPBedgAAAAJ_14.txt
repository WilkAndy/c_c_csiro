The concentrations of normal fatty acids were essentially similar, with the possible exception of a high content of normal fatty acids in the LPS of Desulfovibrio gigas. Determination of monounsaturated acid double bond configuration was performed by GLC-MS analysis of the derivatized fatty acids. A total of nine branched chain and eight straight chain monounsaturated fatty acids was detected in the Desulfovibrio species analyzed. The major component detected in five Desulfovibrio was the 17-carbon iso-branched monoenoic acid which showed cis unsaturation [i17:1(n-7)c] seven carbons from the terminal methyl group of the fatty acid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11236954598765132965", "cites_id": ["11236954598765132965"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022227520343029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pXyW8Kuu8ZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 7, "1987": 6, "1988": 10, "1989": 4, "1990": 6, "1991": 10, "1992": 6, "1993": 10, "1994": 1, "1995": 8, "1996": 6, "1997": 8, "1998": 5, "1999": 7, "2000": 13, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 13, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 15, "2007": 7, "2008": 5, "2009": 11, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
