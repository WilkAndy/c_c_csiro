The most dramatic changes in incorporation of NaH14CO3 were found in the neutral-lipid fraction. During late November, when chl a \u00b7 m\u22122 showed an overall increase, 7\u201311% of the total carbon assimilated was incorporated into neutral lipids. Incorporation dropped to 0.1 % in early December as chl a \u00b7 m\u22122 leveled off, then recovered to 13 % in late December, as a secondary sea-ice diatom bloom became established. The dynamic changes in photosynthetic carbon assimilation into neutral lipids suggested that profound changes in physiological state occurred in sea-ice diatom communities during the spring bloom."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9672651986291346779", "cites_id": ["9672651986291346779"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022098188902419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W03fzrspPIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 5, "1991": 9, "1992": 1, "1993": 8, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
