Comparisons were made between two size classes of squid: those of mantle length <200 mm and those of mantle length >200 mm. Smaller squid had frequently consumed crustaceans and cephalopods; fish were of secondary importance. Larger squid consumed mostly fish and moderate amounts of cephalopods, but had rarely consumed crustaceans. These findings were supported by comparisons drawn between digestive-gland fatty-acid profiles and the fatty-acid profiles of potential prey species. Fatty-acid analyses indicated that the crustaceans Euphausia lucens, Munida gregaria and Themisto gaudichaudii were important prey items of smaller squid, whereas stomach content and fatty-acid analyses indicated that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18299215831527462908", "cites_id": ["18299215831527462908"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-003-0509-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Bdmatjf8_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
