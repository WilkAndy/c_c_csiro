Total lipid per digestive gland decreased significantly during starvation compared to Day 0 individuals, falling from 1960 (\u00b1172) to 385 (\u00b181) \u03bcg. Polar lipid was the major lipid class utilised during starvation, falling from 1510 (\u00b1225) to 177 (\u00b146) \u03bcg per digestive gland (76 to 45%). Absolute levels of triacylglycerol fell from 300 (\u00b141) to 76 (\u00b15) \u03bcg; however, relative levels remained unchanged. The relative level of free fatty acid increased significantly with starvation (4 to 39%) with absolute levels ranging from 79 (\u00b11) to 156 (\u00b120) \u03bcg per digestive gland. Absolute levels of all fatty acids per digestive gland declined continually until the end of the starvation period.
