Therefore it is of interest to optimize n\u22123 LC-PUFA deposition in fish via a reduction in \u03b2-oxidation which may be induced by manipulation of dietary fatty acids. This study tested whether Atlantic salmon smolt fed a diet with a higher docosahexaenoic acid (DHA):eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ratio and a lower content of n\u22123 LC-PUFA to that of fish oil (FO) based diets would enhance deposition of n\u22123 LC-PUFA in fish tissues. Comparisons were made between fish fed: a FO diet, a blend of 50% rapeseed and 50% tuna oil diet (model oil, MO 1), a blend of 50% rapeseed, 25% tuna and 25% FO diet (MO 2), and a blend of 50% FO and 50% chicken fat diet (FO/CF). The dietary DHA:EPA ratio was in the order MO 1>MO 2>FO/CF~FO. Dietary n\u22123 LC-PUFA content was approximately 2-fold \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13791033807375142605", "cites_id": ["13791033807375142605"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848612003146", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zY7_BS6YY78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 11, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
