Lipid class, fatty acid and sterol composition were determined for associated potential prey items and for phyllosomes captured between 50 and 90 km offshore from the northeastern coast of New Zealand. Phospholipid was the dominant lipid class in all potential prey items and the transparent phyllosomes. The levels of other lipid classes varied between potential prey items, with the next most abundant classes being triacylglycerols, free fatty acids and sterols. A limited number of the potential prey items also contained wax ester. Major fatty acids in all potential prey items were generally 22:6\u03c93 (docosahexaenoic acid), 16:0, 18:1\u03c99c, and 20:5\u03c93 (eicosapentaenoic acid). Multivariate analyses of fatty acid and sterol content of the samples grouped the phyllosoma samples together \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18206811432876505193", "cites_id": ["18206811432876505193"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590400034X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:afgfzYiWq_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
