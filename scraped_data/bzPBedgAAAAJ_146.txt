The lipid content, lipid class, fatty acid and sterol composition of E. superba fed on each cultured phytoplankton and a mixed diet of both species, were determined. No significant difference was found between total lipid levels of E. superba reared on each of these different diets. Phaeocystis pouchetii, although deficient in a number of the essential fatty acids, is apparently an adequate food source for E. superba. The proportion of polyenoic fatty acids varied within lipid classes although there was no significant difference between levels of the long chain polyunsaturate 20:5(n-3) in the total lipid of E. superba fed on these diets. This acid was found to be less than 1% of the total lipid in Phaeocystis pouchetii compared to 37% in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15769220406876437617", "cites_id": ["15769220406876437617"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/lipid-composition-of-euphausia-superba-dana-in-relation-to-the-nutritional-value-of-phaeocystis-pouchetii-hariot-lagerheim/380D2A123AD29BCC208106FA16904096", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cfy1QGmG19oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
