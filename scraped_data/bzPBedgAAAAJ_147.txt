A range of unusual acids were characterized (eg E-i16: 145 and E-a17: 145 (where E designates trans stereochemistry) as major isomers). Most of these acids have not previously been identified in sediments (see, for example, Boon et al., 1978) and Matsuda and Koyama, 1977). It was thus of interest to analyse a range of marine sediments for their monoenoic acids in order to demonstrate the presence of these, and other, specifically bacteria-derived acids. Studies of the adenylate energy charges in marine sediments (Christensen and Devol, 1980) are consistent with the bacterial population being in a physiologically depressed state: the energy charge of sedimentary populations is close to that observed in late stationary phase laboratory cultures. Previous studies have also indicated that the majority of the bacteria in the sediments we have studied were facultative aerobes, even in strongly anoxic muds (Perry et al., 1979; Volkman et al., 1980). This suggests that growth of these bacteria is microaerophilic. Since acetate is commonly the major soluble organic carbon source in marine sediments (Belyaev et al., 1980), cultures grown microaerophilically to stationary phase on acetate as carbon source should best mimic the sedimentary conditions. Growth was, ho r, observed to be more rapid with glucose as carbon source: minimal alteration of the fatty acid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2218716531940836371", "cites_id": ["2218716531940836371"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2218716531940836371&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E8SeN-52yh4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 9, "1986": 6, "1987": 5, "1988": 5, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
