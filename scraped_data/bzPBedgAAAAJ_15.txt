All species are easily maintained in culture, though cultures of Acartia spp. are easier to establish because of the positive phototactic behaviour of this genus. B. similis and P. crassirostris are smaller than A. sinjiensis, and consequently, their developmental stages are more suited to larval fish requiring small prey items. In addition, siphon-avoidance experiments indicated that adults of these species were more vulnerable to predation, though this was not the case for juvenile copepods. Egg production was maximised with larger algal cells, especially Rhodomonas sp. and Heterocapsa niei: B. similis fed H. niei achieved the highest egg production rates (48 eggs female\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 259, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10968498935011796171", "cites_id": ["10968498935011796171"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848603001613", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y-Sg9KrvN5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 17, "2007": 6, "2008": 10, "2009": 18, "2010": 10, "2011": 13, "2012": 17, "2013": 15, "2014": 16, "2015": 12, "2016": 21, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 15, "2020": 16, "2021": 18, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
