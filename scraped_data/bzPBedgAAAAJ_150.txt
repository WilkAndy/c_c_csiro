The major ester-linked fatty acids of the phospholipids were palmitic, palmitoleic and oleic acids, which are more typical of microeukaryotes than of eubacteria. Lipopolysaccharide lipid A (LPS) was detected; it contained major proportions of long chain normal 3-OH fatty acids (3-OH eicosanoic at 23% and 17% of the total in two strains of Planctomyces, and 3-OH octadecanoic at 18%, and 3-OH palmitic at 11% of the total in one strain of Pirellula). Major portions of long chain 3-OH fatty acids in the LPS are extremely unusual and provide another atypical property of these organisms.
