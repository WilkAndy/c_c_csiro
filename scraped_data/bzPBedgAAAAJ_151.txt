Development of intra-specific resource partitioning is more pronounced in species with clear phenotypic variation among individuals (eg age or sex). Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina have pronounced sexual dimorphism and range widely in size and foraging range between juvenile and adult stages. However, hypothesized diet-based resource partitioning has been less clear due to difficulties in sampling diet while seals are away from breeding islands. We analysed fatty acids (FAs) from blubber of 122 juvenile seals and compared them to FA profiles from blubber of 52 adult females, and to FA profiles from 51 prey species (grouped as fish and squid) to examine evidence for diet-based resource partitioning in the seals. FA signature analysis revealed physiological and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4893384262191698223", "cites_id": ["4893384262191698223"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v384/p303-312", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L1FsaQ_L6EMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 6}}
