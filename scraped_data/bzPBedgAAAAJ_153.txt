Metabolic activities of the communities were determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into bacterial DNA and sodium [14C]acetate into membrane lipids. Biomass measurements from extractable phospholipid fatty acids per g dry wt. ranged between 6 to 76 nmol, or when converted to number of bacteria, 3.7 \u00d7 108 to 4.5 \u00d7 109 cells per g dry wt. The West Sound site at New Harbor contained the lowest biomass, while Cape Evans on the East Sound contained the greatest. A marked difference was also noted between sites in their sediment microbial community structure. The East Sound sites at Cape Armitage and Cape Evans contained a greater abundance of diatom marker lipids, whilst both sides of the Sound contained approximately the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8739004251661442745", "cites_id": ["8739004251661442745"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/2/4/219/574724", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uZ7ozhAuR3kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 4, "1989": 5, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
