Since members of the genus Arenibacter have not been previously shown to degrade hydrocarbons, we attempted to isolate a representative strain of this genus in order to directly investigate its hydrocarbon-degrading potential. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, one isolate (designated strain TG409T) exhibited >99% sequence identity to three type strains of this genus. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain TG409T represents a novel species in the genus Arenibacter, for which the name Arenibacter algicola sp. nov. is proposed. We reveal for the first time that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation is a shared phenotype among members of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2104184440256963031", "cites_id": ["2104184440256963031"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.03104-13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:16Frl5mQMx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
