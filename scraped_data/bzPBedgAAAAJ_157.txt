Higher initial glucose concentration (100 g/L compared to 40 g/L) did not result in markedly different biomass (48 g/L) or fatty acid (12\u201314 g/L) yields by 69 h. This comparison suggests factors other than carbon source were limiting biomass production. The effect of both glucose and glycerol as carbon sources for Aurantiochytrium sp. strain TC 20 was evaluated in a fed-batch process. Both glucose and glycerol resulted in similar biomass yields (57 and 56 g/L, respectively) by 69 h. The agro-industrial waste from biodiesel production\u2014glycerol\u2014is a suitable carbon source for Aurantiochytrium sp. strain TC 20. Approximately half the fatty acids from Aurantiochytrium sp. strain TC 20 are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14337000621119001412", "cites_id": ["14337000621119001412"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-013-4965-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RFNarhpC98YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
