Total lipid was higher in Elephant Island E. antarctica (whole fish, 466\u2013585 mg g\u22121 dry weight) than those from Eastern Antarctica (394\u2013459 mg g\u22121). Wax esters comprised 86.2\u201390.5% of total lipid in E. antarctica flesh. There were no significant differences between Eastern Antarctica and Elephant Island in total wax ester levels, or in levels of wax esters between different tissues analysed. Oily bones (up to 326 mg g\u22121 in the neurocranium) characterized E. antarctica from both locations, with wax esters as the major skeletal lipid class (67.0\u201387.9%, percent of lipid). The wax esters may have a buoyancy role in E. antarctica. The only substantial amount of triacylglycerols (29.4%) were found in the viscera of Elephant Island fish.
