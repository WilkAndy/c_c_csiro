The effect on growth performance, tissue fatty acid profiles and disease resistance was monitored after 63 days. At the conclusion of the trial, no significant differences were detected in growth between any of the feeds. Fatty acid composition of whole carcass, dorsal muscle and liver generally reflected that of the diets. Forty percent of the FO could be replaced by SFO before tissue 22:6n-3 was significantly reduced, although other essential and non-essential fatty acids were more susceptible to change. Significant differences were detected in cumulative mortality of Atlantic salmon challenged with Vibrio anguillarum at the trials conclusion, although this was not correlated to the inclusion level of SFO. Despite the changes observed to the tissue fatty acid profile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9127552292903140077", "cites_id": ["9127552292903140077"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590300143X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7TpLV3OUq34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 10, "2007": 11, "2008": 11, "2009": 12, "2010": 16, "2011": 22, "2012": 7, "2013": 21, "2014": 13, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 18, "2018": 13, "2019": 12, "2020": 13, "2021": 17, "2022": 16, "2023": 1}}
