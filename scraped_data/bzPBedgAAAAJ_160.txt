These are the first lipid biomarker studies for most of these species. Lipid content was low and dominated by polar lipid in the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia pachyptila, mussels Bathymodiolus sp. and limpets Lepetodrilus spp. The galatheid (Munidopsis subsquamosa) and most brachyuran adult (Bythograea thermydron) crabs were characterized by higher storage lipid (triacylglycerol). Total polyunsaturated fatty acids were similar in R. pachyptila plume and body, but higher in the posterior part of the soft body, which had more docosahexaenoic acid (2\u20135% of total FA) compared to the anterior and plume (\u22640.3%). Two sulphur-oxidizing bacterial markers, 16:1(n\u22127)c and 18:1(n\u22127)c, were high in R. pachyptila and mussel (up to 23%), but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16164719323524947434", "cites_id": ["16164719323524947434"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096495905000680", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6t2YlJSeVOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
