A dose\u2013response technique was used. Seven experimental emulsions were formulated with increasing concentrations of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and used to enrich rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis). Enriched rotifer 22:6n-3 concentrations ranged from approximately 2 to 16 mg/g dry matter (DM). Enriched rotifers were fed to striped trumpeter larvae from 5 to 18 days post-hatch (dph). No relationship was identified between larval growth or survival and dietary 22:6n-3, nor was there any significant relationship between larval response to salinity and temperature challenges to dietary 22:6n-3. Larvae fed low dietary 22:6n-3 displayed erratic swimming behaviour, suggesting inferior quality larvae compared with those fed higher dietary 22:6n-3. A significant inverse relationship between the syndrome, \u2018grey \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8587586838721830469", "cites_id": ["8587586838721830469"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848605002152", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RZ7VF7s8LXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
