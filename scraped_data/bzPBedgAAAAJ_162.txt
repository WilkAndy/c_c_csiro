The alkyl glyceryl ether diols (1\u2010O\u2010alkyl glycerols, GE) of Clione DAGE are dominated by 16\u22360 (60%) and 15\u22360 (21%), in contrast with deep\u2010sea shark liver DAGE, which is dominated by 18\u22361 GE. The fatty acid profiles of Clione and Limacina are similar (28\u201332% polyunsaturated, 26\u201334% monounsaturated) as are the sterols, which include 24\u2010methylenecholesterol, transdehydrocholesterol, cholesterol, and desmosterol. This finding probably reflects the fact that Limacina is the major food source for Clione. Spongiobranchaea australis, another Southern Ocean pteropod (order Gymnosomata), has 0.9\u20131.7% DAGE, but has less lipid (3.3\u20134.8 mg/g lipid, wet weight) than Clione (50.8 mg/g \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13845799494268362739", "cites_id": ["13845799494268362739"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-997-0141-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8x8mJ0gpJsAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 6}}
