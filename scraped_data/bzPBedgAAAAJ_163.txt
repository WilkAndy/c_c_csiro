The matlike appearance developed as a result of the closely-packed manner inwhich the basal ends of the filaments were anchored to the substrate. The dominant phospholipid fatty acids of these filaments (16:0, 16:1w7c, 18:0, 18:1w7c) were similar to those recovered from a sample of Beggiatoa isolated from a spring in Florida. Filaments from both sources contained small quantities of C18 and C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well. A larger but less abundant sheathless, filamentous form, which also contained sulfur inclusions and displayed a cell wall structure similar to a previously described Thioploca strain, also colonized the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1214220577190654090", "cites_id": ["1214220577190654090"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00447013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ijBrhi7H2RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
