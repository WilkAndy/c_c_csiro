The main food components were crabs, predominantly Nectocarcinus integrifons, and juvenile fishes. Most dietary items were inhabitants of the seagrass zone. Small (25-33 cm) rock flathead showed a preference for fish, squid and shrimp whereas larger (> 33 cm) individuals consumed mainly N. integrifons together with some fish. Seasonal variations in diet and feeding intensity occurred. A decrease in feeding intensity in winter was accompanied by a shift in diet from N. integrifons to fish and squid. A second decline in feeding intensity corresponded to the apparent spawning period. The rock flathead and its main prey, N. integrifons, both showed a rhythm in locomotory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3130637491193935449", "cites_id": ["3130637491193935449"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf9830745", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WXYiHzZCcisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 5, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
