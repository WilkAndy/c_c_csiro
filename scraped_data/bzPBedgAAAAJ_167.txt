Most concentrations of dissolved heavy metals in the Gordon and upper King Rivers were similar to those found in normal coastal sea waters, but such concentrations were up to 100 times higher in the harbour waters and were higher still in the lower King River. Much of the large particulate load in the lower King was removed during estuarine mixing. In the harbour, low dissolved oxygen (< 175\u00b5M) was found in intermediate waters at two sites, accompanied by higher heavy-metal and lower iodate concentrations. Strong copper-complexing capacities were proportional to humic concentrations but were always exceeded by concentrations of dissolved copper. Total dissolved iodine was conservative, whereas dissolved iodate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1233374742070269738", "cites_id": ["1233374742070269738"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF9910625", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KpcJEMvTHREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
