Spatial variations in diet among these areas were investigated using stomach contents and lipid and fatty acid profiles. Myctophid fish were prominent prey items at all sites, and the diet at New Zealand sites contained temperate myctophid species that were not identified at other sites. The diet at the Falkland Islands differed considerably from other sites due to the large proportion of cephalopod prey that had been consumed by M. ingens. This is likely to be due to the absence of key myctophids, such as Electrona carlsbergi, and the abundance of smaller squid such as Loligo gahi and juvenile M. ingens over the Patagonian Shelf. Stomach contents data could not be used effectively to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4170831609693935657", "cites_id": ["4170831609693935657"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/dietary-variation-of-the-squid-moroteuthis-ingens-at-four-sites-in-the-southern-ocean-stomach-contents-lipid-and-fatty-acid-profiles/DF46F7DE6D1E851B33259D403A38656E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KRjHQUDF4TkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
