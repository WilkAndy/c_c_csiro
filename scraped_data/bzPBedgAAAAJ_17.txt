The analyses report the exact molecular structure of component acids which is essential for taxonomic and food chain studies. The acid 16:4\u03c93 could be taxonomically distinguishing for species of the Chlorophyta. The occurrence of cis-vaccenic acid (18:1\u03c97) in the algae reported here suggests a distribution in marine benthic algae which is wider than hitherto realised, with particular taxonomic importance for Chlorophyta species in which it occurs in high levels. Corallina officinalis was found to contain the non-methylene interrupted acids 20:2 and 22:2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 248, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10202861194482365452", "cites_id": ["10202861194482365452"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031942279800187", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DDS9BTPYl40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 5, "1986": 7, "1987": 3, "1988": 5, "1989": 6, "1990": 7, "1991": 8, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 5, "1996": 7, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 14, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 6}}
