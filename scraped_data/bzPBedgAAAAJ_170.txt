These demands may greatly compromise the energy reserves of the lobsters following settlement, leading to reduced growth and survival in the wild, and also in aquaculture. Therefore, the lipid class and fatty acid composition of wild caught pueruli and first instar juveniles of the spiny lobster Jasus verreauxi (H. Milne Edwards, 1851) were analysed by thin layer chromatography-flame ionisation detection and capillary gas chromatography. Pueruli contained substantially more lipid than first instar juveniles (mean difference =3.5 mg, or 41.9%) and most of this difference was due to the presence of greater amounts of polar lipid (mean difference =3.9 mg or 49.2%) in pueruli. First instar juveniles contained significantly more triacylglycerol (mean =0.2 mg), consistent with the polar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6484276231810977337", "cites_id": ["6484276231810977337"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109564330100455X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OQ6aruDG_FkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
