Two species, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Krefftichthyes anderssoni were lipid-rich (406\u2013456 mg g\u22121 dry weight whole fish) with wax esters (WE) the major lipid class. In three species, G. opisthopterus, G. nicholsi, and Electrona carlsbergii, triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major lipid. All fish had oily bones, with values up to 471 mg g\u22121 dry weight in the vertebral centra of K. anderssoni. The principal fatty acids of the TAG-rich myctophids included the monoenes 18:1(n-9) and 20:1. There were lower levels of 16:0 and 18:0 saturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were present at higher abundance in the TAG-rich E. carlsbergii and G. opisthopterus, with lower levels in G. nicholsi. In comparison, the WE-dominated species contained lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11645244937826448246", "cites_id": ["11645244937826448246"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/wax-esters-versus-triacylglycerols-in-myctophid-fishes-from-the-southern-ocean/506B4DA1D639F8E0DD3D905B7ED80286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:drOPYZI4nKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
