The fatty acid profile of N. australis was markedly unsaturated, with a mean total \u03c93 fatty acid content of 48.6\u00b12.4% of total fatty acids. N. australis contained high levels of the essential long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5\u03c93) and docosahexaencic (DHA, 22:6\u03c93), ranging from 16.6 to 36.5% and 11.1 to 24.8%, respectively. The concentration of total carotenoids ranged from 137 to 302 \u03bcg g\u22121 dry wt, with no significant differences in concentrations found with season or life stage. The carotenoids were comprised of 79.5% astaxanthin and 20.5% canthaxanthin. The lipid and pigment compositions of N. australis suggest that the species could serve as a suitable feed source for cultured salmonids. Like other euphausiids, N. australis contained high levels of fluoride, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3395494689877397514", "cites_id": ["3395494689877397514"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00349285", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ChDeKm44Hy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
