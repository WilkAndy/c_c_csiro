We report the isolation of a front-end \u03946-desaturase gene from the microalgae Ostreococcus lucimarinus and two elongase genes, a \u03946-elongase and a \u03945-elongase, from the microalga Pyramimonas cordata. These enzymes efficiently convert their respective substrates when transformed in yeast (39\u201375% conversion for \u03c93 substrate fatty acids), and the \u03945-elongase in particular displays higher elongation efficiency (75% for conversion of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5\u03c93) to docosapentaenoic acid (22:5\u03c93)) than previously reported genes. In addition, the \u03946-desaturase is homologous with acyl-CoA desaturases and shows a strong preference for the \u03c93 substrate ALA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8951945016257456878", "cites_id": ["8951945016257456878"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-009-9230-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7qraFpCyO3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 13, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
