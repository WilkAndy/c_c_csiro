Lipid was a significant component of the biomass of all larval and post-larval samples (range 63\u2013213 mg g\u22121 of dry biomass). The fatty acid profiles of late stage larvae (8\u20139) suggest that they were feeding on salps and small crustaceans, such as euphausids, from oligotrophic pelagic communities where herbivorous and microbial grazing is an important basis to the food web. There was a marked decrease in lipid content of post-larvae progressively across the continental shelf, and this corresponded closely with decreasing dry mass, suggesting that post-larvae were using lipid as an energy source during cross-shelf movement at a rate of 1.6 J km\u22121. This is considerably lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8811307740223335480", "cites_id": ["8811307740223335480"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590500268X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OGyplrQNSHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
