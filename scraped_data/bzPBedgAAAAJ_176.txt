The double-bond configuration of the monounsaturated acids has been determined by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the derivatized fatty acids. The monounsaturated fatty acids detected, in decreasing order of abundance, were 24:1 omega 15c, 18:1 omega 9c, 22:1 omega 13c, 20:1 omega 11c, 16:1 omega 7c, 26:1 omega 17c, and 14:1 omega 7c. The fatty acid profile found in F. tularensis, in particular the double-bond positions, represents a valuable taxonomic characteristic of this pathogenic bacterium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=304085729037381914", "cites_id": ["304085729037381914"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/jcm.21.5.738-740.1985", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GvGJBFxUOAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 6, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
