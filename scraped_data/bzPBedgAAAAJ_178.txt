Larvae were also subjected to a hypersaline challenge (55 ppt) with an aim to determine possible relationships between tissue fatty acid profiles, prostanoid production, and their tolerance to osmotic challenge. From 5 to 23 days post-hatch (dph) larvae were fed live food, rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis), that had been enriched with one of five experimental emulsions containing increasing concentrations of ARA and constant EPA and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA). Final ARA concentrations in the rotifers were 1.33, 3.57, 6.21, 8.21 and 11.22 mg g\u22121 DM. Larval growth and survival was unaffected by dietary ARA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15196269879431891663", "cites_id": ["15196269879431891663"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10695-005-8245-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z4qBKvH-49IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
