The analyses were used to clarify the cause of recent reports of illness (diarrhoea) in Australia from consumption of purported rudderfish. Both escolar and rudderfish contained very high levels of oil (generally between 14 to 25%, as % wet mass) in the fillet and the oil compositions were different to most seafood. Escolar oil contained mainly wax ester (>90% of oil). The oil from five specimens of rudderfish contained mainly diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE, >80% of oil) or hydrocarbon (>80% of oil, predominately squalene). One rudderfish specimen contained mainly polar lipid. Major differences in oil content and composition, including fatty alcohol and glyceryl ether diols (derived from DAGE), were observed between purported \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8372546205559440679", "cites_id": ["8372546205559440679"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967301008949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J0XqD2pCMXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
