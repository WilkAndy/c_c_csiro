In general, we find that either pure exopolymer alone or exopolymer generated during in situ growth increases erosion resistance of fine quartz sand. Moreover, the degree of erosion resistance increases in proportion to the concentration of exopolymer\u2010component uronic acids, which in turn is dependent on relative nitrogen content of peptone\u2010based growth media. Specifically, we observe that approximately 100 nmol of exopolymer or 1.5 nmol of component uronic acids generated by in situ bacterial growth under nitrogen\u2010rich conditions per gram of dry sediment can effectively double seawater\u2010flume flow velocity required for initiation of transport of otherwise noncohesive, 125\u2013177 \u03bcm quartz grains.
