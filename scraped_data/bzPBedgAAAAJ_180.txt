Although the biomass decreased as oxygen levels were lowered, consistently high amounts of phospholipid and methyl sterol were synthesized. The greatest amounts of sterol and phospholipid were found in cells grown between 0.5 and 1.1% oxygen (7.2 and 203 mumol/g [dry weight], respectively). While sterol was still synthesized in significant amounts in cells grown at 0.1% oxygen, the major sterol product was the dimethyl form. Analysis by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry showed that the phospholipid esterified fatty acids were predominantly 16:0 and 16:1 and that the hexadecenoates consisted of cis delta 9, delta 10, and delta 11 isomers. At low oxygen tensions, the presence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13640256330970124244", "cites_id": ["13640256330970124244"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/jb.167.1.238-242.1986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1E-_JN3sS70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 3, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
