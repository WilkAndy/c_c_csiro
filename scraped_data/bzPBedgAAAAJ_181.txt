Under these conditions the complete oxidation of glutamate via sulphate reduction accounted for 84% of the available electron equivalents. Fatty acid biomarkers for hydrogen-oxidizing Desulfovibrio sp. (iso 17:1w7c and branched monoenoics) and for acetate-oxidizing Desulfobacter (10 methyl 16:0) were detected in the enrichment. These biomarkers were demonstrated in pure cultures of Desulfovibrio sp. and Desulfobacter sp. obtained from the enrichment. The predominant glutamate-fermenting bacterium isolated from the consortium contained no branched ester-linked phospholipid fatty acids, and produced acetate and hydrogen.
