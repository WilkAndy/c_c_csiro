The major sterol of both species is 24-ethylcholesterol, which is more commonly associated with higher plants and has rarely been reported in unicellular algae. C. antiqua also contained 24-dihydrozymosterol [cholest-8(9)-en-3\u03b2-ol], which is also uncommon in marine algae. The major fatty acids in both raphidophytes are 16:0, 18:4\u03c93, 20:5\u03c93, 16:1\u03c97 and 14:0. Polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for 46\u201350% of the total fatty acids in both species. The fatty acid 18:5\u03c93 was detected in H. akashiwo, but not in C. antiqua. This acid is found in some dinoflagellates and Prymnesiophycean algae, but this is the first report of its presence in the Raphidophyceae. The lipid distributions obtained for H. akashiwo and C. antiqua provide unique signature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15620026428631461663", "cites_id": ["15620026428631461663"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200838716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H6_KREd7xdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 4, "1991": 5, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
