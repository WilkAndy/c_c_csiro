The methodology involved the use of two directly coupled capillary GC columns providing different retention mechanisms, with a pulsing modulator located near their union. The first column was chosen to elute analytes based on b.p. variations, and the second column was based on polarity. Thus, the separation in the two dimensions was orthogonal, since solutes delivered simultaneously to the second column had similar b.p., and the second column separated these primarily on their differentiating mechanisms of polarity. Greater sensitivity of detection and narrower peak widths were obtained; here, peak response increases of about 20\u2010fold were obtained, with pulsed peak widths of about 150 ms. Peaks were displayed in a 2\u2010D contour plot to allow the complexity of the compounds to be seen and their b.p \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=530710223765925660", "cites_id": ["530710223765925660"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-002-0953-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HG88_iJ2XQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
