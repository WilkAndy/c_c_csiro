The percentage and quantitative yield of EPA remained relatively constant at all growth temperatures within or below the optimal growth temperature region. At higher growth temperatures, these values decreased greatly. Growth on differing sole carbon sources also influenced the percentage and amount of EPA produced, with the fatty acid composition influenced by provision of potential acyl chain primers as sole carbon sources. The highest amounts of EPA occurred from growth on propionic acid and l-leucine respectively, while the highest percentage of EPA occurred from growth on l-proline. Monounsaturated fatty acid components and EPA were concentrated in phosphatidylglycerol (PG), while the proportion of branched \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8114863172209755086", "cites_id": ["8114863172209755086"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005276097000684", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zkN2jA_JnXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
