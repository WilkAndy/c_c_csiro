The resulting fatty acid (FA) profiles are the first published for C. yaquinae and among the first for abyssal fishes. They indicated a greater proportion of polyunsaturated FAs and lower monounsaturated FAs than shallower living congeners, suggestive of homeoviscous adaptations to great pressure. Cholesterol was the predominant sterol, which is frequently the case for exclusively carnivorous species. Comparisons of macrourid FA profiles were made to those of benthic prey and epipelagic carrion sources, including the Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas captured in surface waters of the abyssal study site. The FA profiles of macrourid muscle were very similar to those of squid mantle muscle. The FA profiles of macrourid liver and swimbladder were similar to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5222660363032461883", "cites_id": ["5222660363032461883"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v387/p1-14/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OwIQ6e2dekgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
