A full-length cDNA sequence, designated PsElo5, was isolated from P. salina. Sequence alignment showed that the gene was homologous to corresponding ELO-type elongases from other microalgae. Heterologous expression of PsElo5 in yeast and in higher plants confirmed that it encodes a specific \u03945-elongase activity as predicted and, furthermore, within the n-3 pathway, the elongation activity was confined exclusively to EPA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13034284521486889150", "cites_id": ["13034284521486889150"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-008-9157-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vjCZtLYU47QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
