Ten bacterial strains, isolated from Southern Ocean particulate material or from sea ice, were characterized. Whole cell fatty acid profiles and 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolates included representatives of the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella, Polaribacter, and Flavobacterium as well as one strain, which constituted a new bacterial genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae. The isolates are, therefore, members of the \u201cGammaproteobacteria\u201d and Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, the taxonomic groups that have been shown to dominate polar sea ice and seawater microbial communities. Exopolysaccharides produced by Antarctic isolates were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 222, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7042968174360131958", "cites_id": ["7042968174360131958"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-004-0093-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dvkdRT2mvWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 8, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 19, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 13, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 18, "2020": 11, "2021": 23, "2022": 19, "2023": 5}}
