The fatty acids show a predominance of C18 and C22 polyunsaturated components, typical of the Dinophyceae. Eleven sterols were detected, of which eight have been identified. Both 4-methyl sterols (41%) and 4-desmethyl sterols (59%) are present and these exhibit a wider range of structural diversity than has been reported previously for dinoflagellates. 24-Methylenecholesterol, 23,24-dimethylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol and dinosterol are the three major sterols which together represent 75% of the total sterols. Dinosterol is found only in dinoflagellates and in some organisms which feed on dinoflagellates, but the two 4-desmethyl sterols are rarely reported in these algae. The lipid composition indicates that the unicellular alga FCRG 51 is related to the Dinophyceae and not to the Chloromonadophyceae or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3994429718422867049", "cites_id": ["3994429718422867049"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200840339", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aczbXqoQbzcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 4, "1987": 4, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 6, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
