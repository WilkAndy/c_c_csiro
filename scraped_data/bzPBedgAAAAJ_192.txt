However, insufficient n\u20103 long\u2010chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC\u2010PUFA) compromises MTC fish health and growth which requires attention when choosing lipid sources in aquafeed formulations. Fish oil (FO) has been the major lipid source for feeding key MTC fish. We estimated that more than 200 thousand tonnes of FO were used to feed farmed MTC fish in 2016, representing nearly 25% of global FO production. Nevertheless, recent increases in FO prices and demand, and the foreseen inability of wild fisheries to produce sufficient FO in the future, have created a need for cheaper and more sustainable alternatives. Meta\u2010analysis showed that feeding vegetable oils (VO) to MTC fish can slightly reduce their growth, with a marked decrease in n\u20103 LC\u2010PUFA content in the fish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:C-Rn0OCouf8C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14878376306442662479", "cites_id": ["14878376306442662479"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/raq.12287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T3Ia9Guces4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
