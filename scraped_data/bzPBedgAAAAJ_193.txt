The lipid content of the oilseed of a novel transgenic, DHA-producing land plant, Camelina sativa, containing microalgal genes able to produce LC omega-3 oils, contained 36% lipid by weight with triacylglycerols (TAG) as the major lipid class in hexane extracts (96% of total lipid). Subsequent chloroform-methanol (CM) extraction recovered further lipid (~50% polar lipid, comprising glycolipids and phospholipids) and residual TAG. The main phospholipid species were phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine. The % DHA was: 6.8% (of total fatty acids) in the TAG-rich hexane extract and 4.2% in the polar lipid-rich CM extract. The relative level of ALA (\u03b1-linolenic acid, 18:3\u03c93) in DHA-camelina seed was higher than the control. Major sterols in both DHA- and control camelina seeds were: sitosterol, campesterol, cholesterol, brassicasterol and isofucosterol. C16\u2013C22 fatty alcohols, including iso-branched and odd-chain alcohols were present, including high levels of iso-17:0, 17:0 and 19:0. Other alcohols present were: 16:0, iso-18:0, 18:0 and 18:1 and the proportions varied between the hexane and CM extracts. These iso-branched odd-chain fatty alcohols, to our knowledge, have not been previously reported. These components may be derived from wax esters, or free fatty alcohols."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:X0DADzN9RKwC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11045886835309041180", "cites_id": ["11045886835309041180"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/66426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HFbCl43fSpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 5}}
