Lipid composition was dominated by phospholipids in most species. However, energy storage lipids (triacylglycerols and wax esters) contributed> 50% to the total lipids in the lysianassid amphipods and the unidentified caridean shrimp, and lipids made up 19 and 45% of amphipod and 14% of shrimp dry mass, suggesting sporadic feeding and the need for energy storage. The dominant sterol was cholesterol. The presence of phytosterols in the anemone, the polychaetes and Munidopsis sp. suggested consumption of phytodetritus, but none of the specimens had levels suggesting that phytodetritus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17187744707400251306", "cites_id": ["17187744707400251306"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v372/p157-167/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qjexLr8ih-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
