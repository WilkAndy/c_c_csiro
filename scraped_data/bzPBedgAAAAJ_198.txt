However, VO lacks the health-benefitting n-3 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) and potentially compromise farmed fish flesh quality for consumers. In a factorial experiment, barramundi (Lates calcarifer) were grown in either freshwater or seawater and fed on three diets containing different oil sources: FO; stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n-3) rich oil from Echium plantagineum (EO); or rapeseed oil (RO). RO and FO-fed fish grew faster than the EO treatment and all three dietary treatments were not affected by salinity. A fatty acid mass balance showed that feeding barramundi on EO diet bypassed the first rate-limiting step in n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis. However, the fish did not accumulate high EPA or DHA content. Total PUFA, mainly of the n-3 series and dominated by ALA (18:3n-3) and SDA, in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11461323680780632514", "cites_id": ["11461323680780632514"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848610008677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wsGzuCnNDp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
