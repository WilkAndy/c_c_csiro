The microalgae were grown under defined conditions and harvested during log phase. Significant concentrations of the polyunsaturated fatty acid 20:5(n-3) (eicosapentaenoic acid) were present in each of the four diatoms Chaetoceros calcitrans, Chaetocerosgracilis, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira pseudonana (4.6\u201311.1% of the total fatty acids), the cryptomonad Chroomonas salina (10.9, 11.9%) and the prymnesiophyte Pavlova lutheri (19.7%). Very small amounts were found in another prymnesiophyte, Isochrysis sp., and the green algae Nannochloris atomus and Tetraselmis suecica but none was detected in the green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta. In contrast, high concentrations of 22:6(n-3) (docosahexaenoic acid) were present only in the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 1344, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5779982012327377755", "cites_id": ["5779982012327377755"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022098189900294", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W7vrPASfNlAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 10, "1991": 18, "1992": 17, "1993": 28, "1994": 20, "1995": 17, "1996": 25, "1997": 31, "1998": 28, "1999": 31, "2000": 41, "2001": 38, "2002": 36, "2003": 39, "2004": 34, "2005": 47, "2006": 45, "2007": 27, "2008": 33, "2009": 41, "2010": 40, "2011": 50, "2012": 63, "2013": 52, "2014": 51, "2015": 69, "2016": 63, "2017": 54, "2018": 62, "2019": 56, "2020": 54, "2021": 54, "2022": 43, "2023": 15}}
