Ulva lobata contained the highest amounts of lipids (20\u201329 mg g\u22121 dry mass), followed by Egregia menziesii (9\u201316 mg) and Chondracanthus canaliculatus (2\u20133 mg), with increased lipids in winter and spring. This was reflected in total fatty acid content (14\u201324, 6\u201313 and 1\u20132 mg g\u22121 dry mass, respectively).Major lipid classes were polar lipids (44\u201394 % of total lipids) and sterols (3\u20138%). Higher levels of triacylglycerols occurred in Egregia menziesii during spring (22%) and in Ulva lobata during summer (12%). Free fatty acids were also variable (0\u201326 %). Triacylglycerols were not detected in Chondracanthus canaliculatus. Low levels of wax esters and diacylglyceryl ethers were detected in Ulva lobata (0.1%).
