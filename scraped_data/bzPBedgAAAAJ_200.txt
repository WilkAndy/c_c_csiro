Chlorophyll a was at a maximum in mid-December, then dropped markedly as the coastal fast ice melted and broke\u2010out. Phytoplankton biomass increased again from mid\u2010 to late\u2010February. Copepods accounted for at least 65% of zooplankton biomass in the water column before sea ice break\u2010out, whereas larval polychaetes and ctenophores dominated after ice break\u2010out. Oncaeacurvata was the numerically dominant species throughout the study. The highest grazing rate (8.7\u2009mg C\u2423m\u22123\u2423d\u22121) was recorded on 21 December when O.\u2423curvata accounted for 64% of the total. Grazing had decreased markedly by 28 December (0.9\u2009mg C m\u22123 d\u22121); again O. curvata accounted for over 50% of the total \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17744753095151184784", "cites_id": ["17744753095151184784"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002270050066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kOt_n-wGQvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 7, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
