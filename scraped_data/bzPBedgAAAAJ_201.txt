A novel sampling scheme made use of a rotating-drum microlayer sampler, a towed Seastar sampler for filtration and extration of subsurface water in situ, and sediment collection in Teflon bags by divers. Particulate and dissolved organic matter was examined for four distinct aquatic environments: the surface microlayer in a no-slick zone (ML), the microlayer in a plume slick (PS), the microlayer in a banded slick (BS) and subsurface waters (SS). The concentrations of lipid classes and of many individual components in particulate matter from water samples generally followed the trend PS > ML > BS > SS, although in several instances the sequence began with ML > PS.
