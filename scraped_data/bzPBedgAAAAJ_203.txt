The strain was able to degrade two- and three-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It exhibited a narrow nutritional spectrum, preferring to utilize aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and small organic acids. Cells produced surface blebs and contained a single polar flagellum. The predominant isoprenoid quinone of strain DG1253T was Q-8. The fatty acid profile was dominated by C18\u200a:\u200a1\u03c97c. The mean DNA G+C content of strain DG1253T was 63.6\u00b10.25 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed this organism within the order   Xanthomonadales   of the class   Gammaproteobacteria  . Its closest relatives included representatives of the   Hydrocarboniphaga  \u2013  Nevskia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8578472486922678828", "cites_id": ["8578472486922678828"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.033324-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LPJ8skbbDHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
