We investigated the extent to which                     FAs were mobilized to support both maternal metabolic requirements and milk                     production in the Weddell seal and how this was reflected in the FA composition                     of the pup\u2019s blubber at the end of lactation (EL). FA composition of                     postpartum female blubber was similar in the 2 yr of study (2002 and 2003) but                     differed markedly by EL. Pup blubber FAs (at EL) were also different between                     years and did not match that of the mother\u2019s milk or blubber. Milk FA                     composition changed during lactation, which may have been a reflection of an                     increase in pup energy demands at different stages of development. In addition,                     there was evidence of feeding by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10996637620975781951", "cites_id": ["10996637620975781951"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/590397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P0j1Uafnm5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 0, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
