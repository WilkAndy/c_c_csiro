This results in the loss of gut contents, which may partly negate the benefits of enrichment with essential fatty acids (EFA). Therefore, the influence of gut content on the lipid composition of juvenile Artemia (5 days old) was examined by starvation alone, or starvation with forced gut evacuation using 20\u201330-\u03bcm plastic beads. Artemia gut content, at 3 and 6 h after the completion of feeding, did not contribute significantly to the total lipid or fatty acid profiles of the Artemia. Artemia subjected to starvation alone (without beads) failed to evacuate their gut over the 6-h starvation period, suggesting they require the intake of suitable-sized particulate matter to undertake gut evacuation. To assess the uptake of EFA in metanauplii (day 2) and juveniles, an enrichment diet containing high levels of arachidonic acid [AA, 20:4n\u22126] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12874032734866973762", "cites_id": ["12874032734866973762"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848601007967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QiR_FJDAqbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
