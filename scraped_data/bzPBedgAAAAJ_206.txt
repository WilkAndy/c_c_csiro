There were clear spatial differences in fatty acid profiles between albacore sampled in the Coral (tropical zone centered at ~20\u00b0S) and Tasman (temperate zone centered at ~42\u00b0S) Seas; however, few differences were observed in fatty acid profiles of albacore sampled off Tasmania and New Zealand. Fatty acid signatures of the Tasman Sea samples reflected a food web based more on diatoms and included: 20:5\u03c93 (EPA), 18:1\u03c97, 22:1\u03c911, 18:2\u03c96, 18:4\u03c93, 18:3\u03c93, and 20:4\u03c93. In contrast, albacore from the Coral Sea had a distinct fatty acid signature which included 20:4\u03c96, 22:5\u03c96, 17:0, 22:4\u03c96, 24:0, and 17:1. Multivariate analyses revealed the importance of 22:6\u03c93 (DHA) in Coral Sea-caught albacore which also had a DHA/EPA ratio more than twice that in all other groups \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2255724312603376771", "cites_id": ["2255724312603376771"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064513004499", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7zvm0_xTR8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
