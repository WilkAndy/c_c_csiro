A range of experiments and measurements were conducted to assess their relative condition in winter and summer. Krill collected in winter had pale yellow\u2013green digestive glands, indicating some recent feeding activity. The size of the digestive glands was small relative to those of krill caught in summer. This indicates that feeding had been occurring at low levels during the collection period. Growth rates, measured using the instantaneous growth rate methodology, were close to zero in winter (range \u22125% to 7% per moult). This was an indication that some food had been available during the period of the moult cycle. Growth rates in spring ranged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5731016330002414965", "cites_id": ["5731016330002414965"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064504001316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:db3B5_yoiE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
