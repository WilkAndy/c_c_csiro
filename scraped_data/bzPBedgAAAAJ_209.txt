Meats, denuded of external fats were cooked by means of conductive dry-heat using a fry grilling hot plate, to a core temperature of 70 \u00b0C. An untrained consumer panel assessed meat appearance, aroma, tenderness, juiciness, taste and overall liking. Results showed no compositional alterations (P > 0.05) to omega-3 fatty acids due to cooking treatment, whereas on absolute terms (mg/100 g muscle) omega-3 fatty acids significantly (P < 0.05) increased. The mean EPA + DHA content of the cooked meat at 32.8 \u00b1 2.3 mg/100 g muscle exceeded the minimum 30 mg/100 g per edible portion required for the defined Australian classification as \u2018source\u2019 long-chain (\u2265 C20) omega-3 for cooked lamb. A 3.4% intramuscular fat content in the initial raw meat was sufficient to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:6ZzL7HXColQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18122858704548251472", "cites_id": ["18122858704548251472"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016302716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UMcxB_lTgfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
