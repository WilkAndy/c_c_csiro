The southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) consumes large quantities of fish and squid prey in the Southern Ocean relative to other marine mammals; however, how diet varies relative to seasonal and spatial foraging behaviour is unknown. We used fatty acid (FA) signature analysis of 63 blubber cores from adult female M. leonina over three seasons (winter 1999, summer 2000 and winter 2001) to determine diet structure. We detected significant differences between seasons and between the main foraging regions (Antarctic continental shelf versus pelagic). We used the FA profiles from 53 fish, squid and krill species to construct a discriminant function that would classify each seal, from its blubber sample as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=760758548054230566", "cites_id": ["760758548054230566"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2003.2371", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JkadaN7BjgoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 9, "2005": 8, "2006": 5, "2007": 20, "2008": 15, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 11, "2012": 14, "2013": 12, "2014": 13, "2015": 16, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 15, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
