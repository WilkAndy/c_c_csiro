Only the lipid content, particularly the phospholipids, decreased significantly with development. Protein declined sharply following moult to the juvenile. PL comprised between 86\u201394% of total lipid in all animals, and declined most between phyllosomata and clear pueruli (238.5 to 121.4 mg g\u22121 DW) (p<0.001). Triacylglycerols were the only lipid to increase in absolute amounts with development, but declined 53% on average following moult to juvenile. This increase in TAG is likely due to the conversion of phospholipids to triacylglycerols. Monounsaturated fatty acids were the main energy form \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5433610263014010043", "cites_id": ["5433610263014010043"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096495908003850", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u-zd5r4PaEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
