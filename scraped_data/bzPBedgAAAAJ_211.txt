PUFA constituted 47.6% of the total FA, with the essential PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (FPA), arachidonic acid, and DHA accounting for 34%. Of particular interest, the unusual very long chain PUFA 6,9,12,15,18,21\u2010tetracosahexaenoic acid (THA, 24\u22366n\u22123) was present at 9.3%, and the rarely reported 6,9,12,15,18\u2010tetracosapentaenoic acid (24\u22365n\u22126) also was detected at 0.8%. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of THA as a major PUFA in a pelagic marine organism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15149786254376551264", "cites_id": ["15149786254376551264"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-003-1180-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YMM101TaPtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
