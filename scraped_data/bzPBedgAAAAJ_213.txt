The sterol composition of aggregate S. thompsoni and I. racovitzai (mostly 24-methyl-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, 24-nordehydrocholesterol, cholesterol and trans-dehydrocholesterol) was reflected in the sterol composition of the commensal amphipods and was consistent with a herbivorous planktonic diet. This was not the case for solitary S. thompsoni, with 24-methylenecholesterol as the major sterol. There was a greater abundance of aggregate salp stanols in 1997 (11.7% total sterols) than 1998 (5.2%) and these different stanol levels were reflected in the commensal amphipods.
