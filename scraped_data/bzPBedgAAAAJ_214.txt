Based on phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, this mocrocosm has been previously reported to be significantly enhanced in type II methanotrophs. Two strains analysed of the type II methanotroph Methylobacterium organophilum were found to contain PHB, with PHB/PLFA ratios similar to those determined for the methane-enriched soil column, suggesting that methanotrophic bacteria enriched in the methane-amended column produced PHB. Control soil and sodium azide-inhibited material, in which methanotroph markers were below detection, did not contain PHB. Biochemical assays, based on the differences observed, can be used to monitor shifts in microbial biomass, community structure and nutritional status of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15408145767646219824", "cites_id": ["15408145767646219824"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00026571", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MM79l_C61NUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
