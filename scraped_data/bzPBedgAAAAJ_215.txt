We undertook a global analysis, compiling FA profiles of 106 chondrichthyan (shark, ray and chimaera) populations, as a model to test the utility of FA profiles to partition a priori trophic guilds, phylogeny, water temperature and habitats. Individual FAs characterizing these four factors were identified, promoting the use of these FAs as ecological tracers across taxa. Habitat type was linked to five FAs: 16:0, 18:0 and biologically essential 22:6\u03c93 (indicative of the deep sea), 20:5\u03c93 (non\u2010complex demersal and deep\u2010sea demersal) and 20:4\u03c96 (reef and brackish water). Temperature was a key driver of four FAs (22:5\u03c96, 22:4\u03c96, 20:1\u03c99 and 20:5\u03c93), while trophic guild and phylogeny were important drivers of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:nU66GSXDKhoC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5837430939352308660", "cites_id": ["5837430939352308660"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.13328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tBv45IK4AlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
