The 200% increase in CO2 by 2100 is predicted to enhance the productivity of fleshy macroalgae that acquire inorganic carbon solely as CO2 (non\u2010carbon dioxide\u2010concentrating mechanism [CCM] species\u2014i.e., species without a carbon dioxide\u2010concentrating mechanism), whereas those that additionally uptake bicarbonate (CCM species) are predicted to respond neutrally or positively depending on their affinity for bicarbonate. Previous studies, however, show that fleshy macroalgae exhibit a broad variety of responses to CO2 enrichment and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This physiological study compared the responses of a CCM species (Lomentaria australis) with a non\u2010CCM species (Craspedocarpus ramentaceus) to CO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:adHtZc2wMuEC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17716312631961841307", "cites_id": ["17716312631961841307"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.4679", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m-7ZRXn83PUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
