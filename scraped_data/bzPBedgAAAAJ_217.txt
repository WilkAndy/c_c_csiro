Heterotrophic microalgae can be cultivated using a by-product from biodiesel production such as glycerol as a carbon source. The oils within the algal biomass can then be converted to biodiesel using transesterification or hydroprocessing techniques. This approach may provide a solution to the limited availability of biomass feedstock for production of biorefined transportation fuels. The life cycle assessment of a virtual production facility, modeled on experimental yield data, has demonstrated that cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae for the production of biodiesel is comparable, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage (90 g CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ijdKiLOsEJMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18288576758266738381", "cites_id": ["18288576758266738381"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-014-0364-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zTb0I6oTzv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
