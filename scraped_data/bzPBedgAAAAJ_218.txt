We investigated FA signatures of connective tissue of the whale shark Rhincodon typus and muscle tissue of the reef manta ray Manta alfredi. We found high levels of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), dominated by arachidonic acid (20:4n-6; 12\u201317 % of total FA), and comparatively lower levels of the essential n-3 PUFA\u2014eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3; ~1 %) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3; 3\u201310 %). Whale sharks and reef manta rays are regularly observed feeding on surface aggregations of coastal crustacean zooplankton during the day, which generally have FA profiles dominated by n-3 PUFA. The high levels of n-6 PUFA in both giant elasmobranchs raise new questions about the origin of their main food source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1209964024353150791", "cites_id": ["1209964024353150791"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11745-013-3829-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R1eSlt6nyhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
