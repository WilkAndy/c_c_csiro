Samples were obtained at 2 time points of the annual migration, which occurs between Antarctic feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding grounds and is associated with a prolonged period of fasting. Blubber lipid composition was dominated by triacylglycerols in all individuals, and the FA profiles of both migration cohorts and sexes were dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). Results indicate that males primarily mobilise polyunsaturated fatty acids in response to migration and fasting, favouring the most readily utilisable FA as governed by their physicochemical properties. In comparison, females appear to initially mobilise short-chain (< 18 carbons) MUFA stores, potentially to attend to dependent calves\u2019 thermoregulatory needs.
