This is because choline, glycine betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide and related compounds, the precursors of TMA, are produced abundantly and ubiquitously by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, particularly those from marine environments. \u201cNoncompetitive\u201d substrates may be a particularly important source for the methane which occurs in the surface mixed layer of the ocean at or above saturation levels. In this study, we measured isotopic fractionation factors for methane and polyisoprenoid lipids formed by methanogens utilizing trimethylamine as their principal carbon source. Methanosarcina barkeri showed isotope effects (\u03b5) of 50.2\u2030 for the conversion of TMA to methane and 20.2\u2030 for TMA-biomass.
