FA compositions were determined by capillary GC and GC\u2013MS, with confirmation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) structure performed by analysis of 4,4-dimethyloxazoline derivatives. PUFA constituted 68\u201374% of the total FA, with the essential PUFA; eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5\u03c93, EPA), arachidonic acid (20:4\u03c96, AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6\u03c93, DHA), accounting for 42\u201344% of the total FA. High proportions of the saturated OC-FA 15:0 (7.1% in TC 01) and 17:0 (6.2% in TC 04) were detected. The OC-FA 17:1\u03c98 was present at 2.8% in TC 01. Of particular interest, the C21 PUFA 21:5\u03c95 and 21:4\u03c97 were detected at 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, in TC 04. A proposed biosynthesis pathway for these OC-PUFA is presented \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10827173038220047436", "cites_id": ["10827173038220047436"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942211002019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TPTKcIPYQZYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
