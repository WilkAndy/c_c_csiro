These membrane components were analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Of particular interest was the occurrence of unsaturated diether lipids in M. burtonii; unsaturated ether lipids accounted for 57% of the diether phospholipids. To our knowledge, unsaturated ether lipids have not been previously reported in a methanogen. The presence of the unsaturated ether lipids in M. burtonii is probably the result of temperature adaptation by the bacterium. It may be possible to use these components as a chemical signature for methanogens in Antarctic and Southern Ocean environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6144231281482338968", "cites_id": ["6144231281482338968"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/98/1-3/205/585519", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mBKZBsyxRFUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 8, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
