Summer water temperatures can average over 19 \u00b0C over several weeks and have negative effects on performance and health. Liver tissue exerts important metabolic functions in thermal adaptation. With the aim of identifying mechanisms underlying liver plasticity in response to chronic elevated temperature in Atlantic salmon, label-free shotgun proteomics was used to explore quantitative protein changes after 43 days of exposure to elevated temperature.A total of 276 proteins were differentially (adjusted p-value <\u20090.05) expressed between the control (15 \u00b0C) and elevated (21 \u00b0C) temperature treatments. As identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), transcription and translation mechanisms, protein \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yJjnfzR0HrkC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=79439979879892313", "cites_id": ["79439979879892313"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-018-4517-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WYW0pT06GgEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
