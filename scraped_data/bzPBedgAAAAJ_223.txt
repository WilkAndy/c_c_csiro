For stable isotopes, the variability in carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures has long been recognised and has been characterised for some taxa. Whilst it is known that metabolic processes may influence fatty acid profiles, the spatial variability of fatty acid profiles has not been documented. Understanding at what scale these 2 biochemical tracers vary, and if the scale of variability corresponds between tracers, is crucial for the correct design and interpretation of combined tracers in trophic studies. This study is the first to examine spatial variability in fatty acid profiles per se, and in combination with stable isotope ratios in the same organisms at multiple spatial scales. We used a spatially hierarchical design which sampled across broad geographic regions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7516600633691021538", "cites_id": ["7516600633691021538"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v410/p25-41/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4iChoXNUUGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
