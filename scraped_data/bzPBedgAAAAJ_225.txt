The hydroxy fatty acid compositions were determined by GC and GC-MS. Of the 16 strains, 5 strains including Methylosinus sporium UQM3306, Methylocystis parvus UQM3309 and Methylocystis minimus UQM3497 were found to contain long-chain (C26, C28 and C30) (\u03c9-1)-hydroxy fatty acids. The total concentration of (\u03c9-1)-hydroxy fatty acids varied between 65 and 500 ng/g. Although only a limited number of species have been analysed to date, a number of differences were apparent when comparing the (\u03c9-1)-hydroxy acid profiles. The type II methanotrophic bacteria generally contained higher relative concentrations of the (\u03c9-1)-hydroxy acids than found in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17039275562470987436", "cites_id": ["17039275562470987436"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014663809290129L", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rNYTm9iqd-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
