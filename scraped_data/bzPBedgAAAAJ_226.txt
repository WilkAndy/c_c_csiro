Echium oil (EO), rich in stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4n-3) and \u03b3-linoleic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6), may enhance the biosynthesis of n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFA by bypassing the rate-limiting FAD6 step. Nutritional and environmental modulation of the mechanisms in LC-PUFA biosynthesis was examined in barramundi, Lates calcarifer, a tropical euryhaline fish. Juveniles were maintained in either freshwater or seawater and fed different dietary LC-PUFA precursors present in EO or rapeseed oil (RO) and compared with FO. After 8 weeks, growth of fish fed EO was slower compared to the FO and RO treatments.
