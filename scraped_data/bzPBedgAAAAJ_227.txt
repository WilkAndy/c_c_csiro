What remains unclear is whether there is any change in the diet of lobsters in reserves, for example, as a result of increased intraspecific competition for food. We used combined chemical tracers to examine the diet of lobsters in fished and reserve areas in 2 bioregions in eastern Tasmania. \u03b4 15 N values of lobsters were richer in fished than in reserve areas, indicating that lobsters eat a greater proportion of food items from higher trophic levels in fished areas. Mixing models suggest that ascidians, sea urchins and the turbinid gastropod were all important food sources for lobsters, but the importance of these food items differed between bioregions. This spatial variability may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7824739001238123994", "cites_id": ["7824739001238123994"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v388/p169-184/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2nXxFKoOl2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
