Their trophic function in the ocean, as well as their ecology and physiology in general, are extremely poorly known. During the ANTARES-4 survey (January and February 1999) their feeding dynamics were investigated in the south Indian Ocean. Results show that their in situ clearance rates may be among the highest recorded in any pelagic grazer, with up to 35 lh\u20131 per colony (length: 17.9\u00b14.3 [SD] cm). Gut pigment destruction rates, estimated for the first time in this tunicate group, are higher than those previously measured in salps and appendicularians, ranging from 54 to virtually 100%(mean: 79.7\u00b119.8%) of total pigment ingested. Although individual colony ingestion rates were high (39.6\u00b117.3 [SD] \u00b5g pigment d\u20131), the total impact on the phytoplankton biomass and production in the Agulhas Front was relatively low, 0.01 to 4.91% and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6521146547957476823", "cites_id": ["6521146547957476823"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v330/p1-11/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1y1FHzzEf1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6}}
