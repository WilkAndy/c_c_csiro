The mean (\u00b1s.e.) estimate of depth-integrated phytoplankton productivity was 914\u00b1185 mgC m-2 day-' (n=9). In the shallow (<30 m) coastal waters, the productivity was 1430\u00b1400 mgC m-2 day-1 (n = 3). At the offshore stations (=30 m), it was 660 \u00b1108 mgC m-2 day-1 (n = 6). At both the shallow and the offshore stations, primary productivity was distributed equally between the phytoplankton size fractions 0.6-2.0\u00b5m and > 10\u00b5m, with little in between. The highest rates of growth occurred within a very narrow light regime: self-shading limited growth in deeper water (at light intensities less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8893929827709514418", "cites_id": ["8893929827709514418"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf9940265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:snLgZQ6WbXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
