Diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFT) analysis for freeze-dried, powdered samples offered a means of obtaining structural information. The bacteria examined were divided into two groups. The first group was characterized by a dominant amide I band and the second group of organisms displayed an additional strong carbonyl stretch at \u223c 1740 cm\u22121. The differences illustrated by the subtraction spectra obtained for microbes of the two groups suggests that FT-IR spectroscopy can be utilized to recognize differences in microbial community structure. Calculation of specific band ratios has enabled to composition of bacteria and extracellular or intracellular storage product polymer mixtures to be determined for bacteria-gum (amide I \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 204, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3162040029711769922", "cites_id": ["3162040029711769922"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167701285900235", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QiGJYKfS4SsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 3, "1990": 8, "1991": 9, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 9, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 7}}
