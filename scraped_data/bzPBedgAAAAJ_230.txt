Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used for structural confirmation of these signature lipids. A mixture of tetraethers from a thermoacidophilic archaebacteria was resolved into three major components by the normal phase separation. These components were differentiated by Fourier self-deconvolution of infrared spectra. The application of the HPLC technique to environmental samples may provide an accurate assessment of archaebacterial biomass in various microbial communities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11831334981853279230", "cites_id": ["11831334981853279230"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022227520388556", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_nMEHHtYMaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 3, "1987": 5, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
