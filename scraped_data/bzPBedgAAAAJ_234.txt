To help prevent such episodes, rapid detection of these fishes in the supply chain of the seafood industry and by food and health inspection agencies is essential. Through a combination of DNA, GC\u2013MS and TLC analyses with reference to authentic samples, fish steaks of oilfish and escolar mislabeled as other species could be accurately identified. The TLC method developed is inexpensive and provides a reliable and importantly rapid identification within 30min."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5341801266820910781,17261509047172011932", "cites_id": ["5341801266820910781", "17261509047172011932"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814608002343", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vY6XOfPjIUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
