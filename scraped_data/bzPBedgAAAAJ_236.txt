Long-chain n-3 rich oils from crops GM with algal genes are promising new sources for the industry. This project studied the use of a newly developed n-3 canola oil (DHA-CA) in diets of Atlantic salmon fingerlings in freshwater. The DHA-CA oil has high proportions of the n-3 fatty acids (FA) 18 : 3n-3 and DHA and lower proportions of n-6 FA than conventional plant oils. Levels of phytosterols, vitamin E and minerals in the DHA-CA were within the natural variation of commercial canola oils. Pesticides, mycotoxins, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals were below lowest qualifiable concentration. Two feeding trials were conducted to evaluate effects of two dietary levels of DHA-CA compared with two dietary levels of FO at two water temperatures. Fish increased their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:rpSJNIKeXWsC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17829603981976802114", "cites_id": ["17829603981976802114"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/n3-canola-oil-effectively-replaces-fish-oil-as-a-new-safe-dietary-source-of-dha-in-feed-for-juvenile-atlantic-salmon/230EC7FF8E1885043CB1CBB1181D908C", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QhOeN1t6b_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 18, "2023": 4}}
