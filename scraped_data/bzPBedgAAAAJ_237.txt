However, species-specific information on fatty acid (FA) deposition, distribution and mobilization is required to develop further the application of FA as trophic markers within the marine environment. Blubber samples were collected from adult female Weddell seals post-parturition and end of lactation, and were divided into inner and outer half sections. We determined the degree to which there was vertical stratification in FA composition, and how this changed over the lactation period. Inner and outer layers of post-parturition blubber cores separated into two distinct groups. Sixty-two per cent of the dissimilarity between the two layers was accounted for by a higher abundance of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1\u03c99c and 16:1\u03c97c) in the outer blubber layer, and more saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 14:0) in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7160310979513187695", "cites_id": ["7160310979513187695"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098107003371", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b302H-aIXmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
