The flesh of all species examined contained high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 32.6\u201356.3% of total fatty acids); all species are therefore good sources of \u03c93 rich marine oils. The fatty acid composition of the oil produced from commercial rendering of D. eleginoides waste contained considerably lower relative levels of PUFA. The degree of fatty acid unsaturation was not related to the geographic location of the species examined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8780578046767761347", "cites_id": ["8780578046767761347"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049194900590", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w4cvSDbh2nkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
