The separation of diphytanyl dietthers, bi-diphytanyl tetraethers, diphytenyl diethers and cyclic bi-diphytanyl tetraethers was achieved. A BPX5 fused-silica capillary column (3m \u00d7 0.25 mm i.d.) and on-column injection were used for the analyses. The GC oven was temperature programmed from 90\u00b0C to 190\u00b0C at 30\u00b0C/min and then 380\u00b0C at 10\u00b0C/min. The final temperature was maintained for 15 min, after which the GC oven returned to 90\u00b0C at 10\u00b0C/min. The instrumental limit of detection, using flame ionisation detection, for individual ether lipids was approximately 1\u20132 ng. GC is widely used in most modern research laboratories and the measurement of archaeal di- and tetraether lipids by high temperature GC provides considerable potential for routine sensitive assay of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9053064483745564311", "cites_id": ["9053064483745564311"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016770129390066Q", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lwZcyi7yon0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
