Our investigations on Australian C. marina demonstrated an absence or only very low concentrations of brevetoxin-like compounds by radio-receptor binding assay and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectroscopy techniques. Chattonella is unique in its ability to produce levels of reactive oxygen species 100 times higher than most other algal species. However, high levels of superoxide on their own were found not to cause fish mortalities. Lipid analysis revealed this raphidophyte to contain high concentrations of the polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 18\u201323% of fatty acids), which has demonstrated toxic properties to marine organisms. Using damselfish as a model organism, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 203, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17349986445481306424", "cites_id": ["17349986445481306424"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988303000465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OGnBfL-Ix_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 10, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 13, "2011": 17, "2012": 21, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 17, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
