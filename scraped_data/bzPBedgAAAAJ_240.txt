Significantly higher relative proportions of energy-rich triacylglycerol were present in the Pavlova-fed rotifers than in the yeast-fed animals, and total lipid content reached a maximum between 12 and 24 h. High incorporation of the essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20: 5\u03c93) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6\u03c93) occurred in the Pavlova-fed rotifers. EPA and DHA content was 11.6% of total fatty acids after 3 h of feeding and reached 20 and 23% after 24 and 48 h respectively. The proportion of essential fatty acids in rotifers fed Pavlova compares very favourably with data obtained by overseas workers using a variety of microalgae and dietary supplements.
