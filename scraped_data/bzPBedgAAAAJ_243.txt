The organism increased its ratio of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids from 1.3 to 1.5 and 1.8 when grown on mannitol, benzene and mannitol+benzene, respectively. The observed increase in saturated fatty acids during growth in the presence of benzene is suggested as a possible mechanism to decrease the fluidity of the cell membrane to tolerate benzene. The organism was found to synthesize hexadecenoic acid, 16:1\u03c96c (11\u201313% of total fatty acids). This is an uncommon fatty acid and previously unreported in Rhodococcus spp."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16376480535931554731", "cites_id": ["16376480535931554731"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/176/1/213/529740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q4tM90fyROMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
