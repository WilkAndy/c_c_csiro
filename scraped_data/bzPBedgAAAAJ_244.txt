Precise monounsaturated double bond position and geometry was determined by GC-MS analysis of the dimethyl disulphide adducts of the monounsaturated fatty acids. No clear distinction was observed between members of the two genera Halomonas and Deleya based upon PLFA composition. The major PLFAs detected in strains from the two genera were 18 : 1w7c, 16: 1w7c and 16 : 0. These three fatty acids accounted for greater than 95% of the total PLFA detected. The PLFA profiles of \u201cFlavobacterium salegens\u201d (ACAM 48) and \u201cFlavobacterium gondwanense\u201d (ACAM 44), proposed new species of moderately halophilic bacteria isolated from Organic Lake, Antarctica, were characterized by high abundances of i15 : 0, a15 : 0, 15 : 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15547577629510724841", "cites_id": ["15547577629510724841"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723202011803553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6ezLvHoXxNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
