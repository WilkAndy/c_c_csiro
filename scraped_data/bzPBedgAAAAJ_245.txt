The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is Australia\u2019s only endemic and globally one of the least numerous pinniped species. However, dietary information is currently limited because of the difficulty in using traditional methods (identification of prey hard parts from scats, regurgitates and stomach samples) to reliably provide dietary information. The present study assessed the use of fatty acid (FA) analysis to infer diet using milk samples collected from 11 satellite tracked Australian sea lions from Olive Island, South Australia. Satellite tracking revealed that females foraged in two distinct regions; \u2018inshore\u2019 regions characterised by shallow bathymetry (10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8\u2009m) and \u2018offshore\u2019 regions characterised by comparatively deep bathymetry (60.5\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4\u2009m).
