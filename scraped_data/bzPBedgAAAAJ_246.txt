The effects of different hydrocarbon mixtures (Special Antarctic Blend [SAB] and BP-Visco), fish oil [orange roughy]) and inoculation of replicate sites with water from Organic Lake (previously shown to contain hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria) on the indigenous microbial population were examined. Of the cultures obtained, those from sites treated with SAB and BP-Visco degraded n-alkanes most consistently and typically to the greatest extent. Two mixed cultures obtained from samples collected at 60 days and two isolates obtained from these cultures extensively degraded phenanthrene. 1-Hydroxy-naphthoic acid formed the major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15174695910371230851", "cites_id": ["15174695910371230851"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/hydrocarbon-degradation-by-antarctic-coastal-bacteria/23D89881C938A51E23E5739AF27380F0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gwRAEIhZl9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
