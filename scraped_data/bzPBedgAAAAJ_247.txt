Under culture in Zobell's broth at 15 \u00b0C exponential-phase cultures produced 3.2 + 0.3% EPA, or 1.2 + 0.2 mg (g bacterial dry wt)-1. Alteration of growth phase, addition of biotin to the medium or a 10-fold decrease in nutrient levels had no significant effect (P>0.05) on levels of EPA. Growth in 7.0% NaCl medium markedly decreased the overall degree of fatty acid unsaturation (P<0.01), while growth on acetate as the sole carbon source increased the level of 18:2.6 from 0.4 + 0.1% to 7.1 % of total fatty acids through inhibition of branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. Addition of desaturase cofactors to the growth medium increased the proportion of EPA from 3.2 + 0.3% to 4.6%, but decreased the quantitative yield from 1.2. 0.2 to 0.9 mg (g bacterial dry wt)-1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12029703216839033348", "cites_id": ["12029703216839033348"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-140-3-577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BIIQ8VYX8qYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
