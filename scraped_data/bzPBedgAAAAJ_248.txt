A polyphasic approach to taxonomy of the microbiota has extended the known range of microbial diversity through description of nine new species including bacteria and archaea. Low temperature and reduced water activity are the major constraints on microbial growth in the lakes. B\u011blhr\u00e1dek-type models provide a good description of temperature dependence and indicate the potential of the microbiota to colonise their natural habitats. Physiological traits of the microbiota selected by the physical and chemical characteristics of the saline lakes suggest biotechnological potential in areas such as polyunsaturated fatty acid production and hydrocarbon degradation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3183589267901015933", "cites_id": ["3183589267901015933"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01929911", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fWf8X5JhLiwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
