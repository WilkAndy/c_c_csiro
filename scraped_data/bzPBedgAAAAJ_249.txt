The largest changes in \u03b413C values in the food chains is at the point involving seagrasses and their direct herbivores. The latter have more negative \u03b413C values (H. melanochir - 12.1%o, isopods - 11.4%o). Little or no change in \u03b413C values is apparent at the higher trophic levels (carnivores - 13 .0\u2030 to - 14.9\u2030).
