Sea\u2010ice diatom communities were dominated by Amphiprora sp., Nitzschia stellata Manguin and Berkeleya sp. at Cape Armitage; N. stellata, Amphiprora, Pleurosigma, N. kerguelensis (O'Meara) Hasle and some small centric diatoms adjacent to the Erebus Ice Tongue; and Porosira pseudodenticulata (Hustedt) Jouse at Wohlschlag Bay. Lipid distributions of the sea ice diatom communities from the Cape Armitage and Ereus sites were characterized by high concentrations of tracylaglecycerol (triacylglycerolplar lipid = 1.0 to 1.5). The hydrocarbon n\u2010C21:6, common in temperate diatoms, and an isoprenoid C25 diunsaturated alkene were the dominant hydrocarons detected at these two sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13950826506074415795", "cites_id": ["13950826506074415795"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1988.tb04459.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s2Kr6cpKm8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 14, "1991": 9, "1992": 12, "1993": 8, "1994": 4, "1995": 24, "1996": 4, "1997": 8, "1998": 10, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 9, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
