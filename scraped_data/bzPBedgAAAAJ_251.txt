However, little research has been performed on the oils of cold water thraustochytrids, in particular from the North Sea region. In this study, thraustochytrid strains from British waters showed high relative levels of omega-3 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6\u03c93). The relative levels of DHA (as % of total fatty acids, TFA) in the different British strains are hitherto amongst the highest recorded from any thraustochytrid screening study, with strain TL18 reaching up to 67% DHA in modified Glucose-Yeast Extract-Peptone (GYP) medium. At this screening stage, low final biomass and fatty acid yield were observed in modified GYP and MarChiquita-Brain Heart Broth (MCBHB), while PUFA profiles (as % of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10511241755778893818", "cites_id": ["10511241755778893818"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-017-1149-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-kd0ma9u35EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
