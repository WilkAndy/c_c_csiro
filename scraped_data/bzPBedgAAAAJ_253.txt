The need to investigate new oil sources exists. The present study tested the hypothesis that in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), a high intake of stearidonic acid (SDA) from Echium oil (EO) would result in increased n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis due to a lower requirement for \u03946 desaturase. Comparisons were made with fish fed on diets containing rapeseed oil (RO) and FO in freshwater for 112 d followed by 96 d in seawater. EO fish had higher whole-carcass SDA and eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA) in freshwater and prolonged feeding on the EO diet in seawater resulted in higher SDA, ETA, EPA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) compared with RO fish.
