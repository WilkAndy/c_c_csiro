Three isolipidic diets with 0, 10 or 15% (w/w) PFAD, at the expense of fish oil, were formulated and fed to triplicate groups of trout maintained at water temperatures of 15 or 20\u00b0C. The apparent digestibility (AD) of fatty acids was measured using yttrium oxide as an inert marker. Increasing dietary PFAD, which contains mainly free fatty acids (FFA), led to a significant (P<0.05) improvement in the AD of saturated fatty acids (SFA) but not that of total monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids in trout maintained at both water temperatures. High AD of total lipids (90\u201393%) was observed in all treatments. Based on fecal lipid class and fatty acid composition, this improvement in SFA digestibility was due in part to the increased absorption of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15724577294149906186", "cites_id": ["15724577294149906186"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848610005570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cm_6lLzrONoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
