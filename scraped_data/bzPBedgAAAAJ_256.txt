Sustainable management outcomes are regularly based on the dispersal patterns of the waste, with biochemical tracing a key tool in understanding the footprint of aquaculture. We examined the use of fatty acid (FA) analysis to trace aquaculture waste for this purpose, with the aim of identifying specific biomarkers for environmental applications, as well as identifying challenges that are regularly encountered. Overall, the widespread use of terrestrial\u2010based oils in the production of marine aquaculture feeds has increased the use of FA biomarkers to trace aquaculture waste across benthic and pelagic systems, in vertebrates, invertebrates and environmental samples such as sediment and seston.
