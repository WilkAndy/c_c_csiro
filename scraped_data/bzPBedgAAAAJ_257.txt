Aquaculture of large carnivorous fish generates substantial waste as faeces and lost feed, providing a food source to mobile benthic invertebrates. We used a controlled feeding study combined with a field survey to better understand the interaction between salmon aquaculture and the sea urchin, Echinus acutus, a dominant mobile invertebrate in Norwegian fjords. We tested if diets affected urchin fatty acid composition by feeding them one of three diet treatments (\u201caquafeed\u201d, \u201ccomposite\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d) for 10 weeks. To test if proximity to fish farms altered E. acutus fatty acid composition, populations were sampled at 10 locations in Hardangerfjord and Masfjord (Western Norway) from directly adjacent and up to 12 km from farms. Fatty acids were measured in gonads and eggs in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:E7VqQtBCVmcC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16592200361636746952", "cites_id": ["16592200361636746952"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717303571", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yFZ31VFWQ-YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
