Striped trumpeters are multiple spawners with group synchronous oocyte development and spawn in the wild from late winter to early spring. By shifting light and temperature regimes, it is possible to manipulate broodstock to spawn in captivity outside of their normal ambient season. Broodstock condition, egg morphology and biochemistry were examined over a spawning season for three groups of broodstock held under ambient or photothermal-manipulated (PTM) conditions. Using a Torry Fish Fatmeter the muscle fat of male and female striped trumpeter broodstock held under ambient conditions was found to decrease over a season by 25% and 40%, respectively. Five general trends were observed in eggs spawned during both ambient and PTM seasons.
