Lipid content, lipid class and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for whole krill and digestive glands (DG). Changes detected in whole krill were almost entirely associated with the lipid variability observed in DG. With marked diet-induced changes, DG lipids were the major repository for the trophic signal in krill. DG lipid content increased in krill fed on phytoplankton due to the accumulation of polar lipid (0.5 mg per DG) and triacylglycerol (up to 1.7 mg per DG). Herbivorous diets induced distinct FA signatures in the DG, characterised by higher proportions of: 16: 1\u03c97 and 20: 5\u03c93 in diatom-fed krill; 18: 1\u03c99 and 18: 4\u03c93 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11342845035696494743", "cites_id": ["11342845035696494743"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v296/p65-79/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lxj-hnbhaZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
