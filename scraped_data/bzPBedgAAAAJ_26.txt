L, in diets for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was investigated. Four experimental diets containing 100% thraustochytrid oil (TO), 100% palm oil (PO) and a 4:1 palm and thraustochytrid oil mixture (MX) were compared to a fish oil (FO) diet over 9 weeks. A saltwater transfer challenge occurred at the end of the trial for 14 days to test the diet treatments on the ability of salmon to smolt. There were no significant differences in the feed consumption of the diets or the digestibility of the \u03c93 or \u03c96 PUFA, indicating no differences in the digestibility of fatty acids between diets. No significant differences were noted between the growth of fish on the four diet treatments. Significant differences were noted in the fatty acid profiles of the fish muscle tissues between all diets. Fish on the TO diet had \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12187845959664064872", "cites_id": ["12187845959664064872"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643307010252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aNn0ilPtI6kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 11, "2014": 4, "2015": 14, "2016": 17, "2017": 19, "2018": 18, "2019": 17, "2020": 17, "2021": 24, "2022": 24, "2023": 3}}
