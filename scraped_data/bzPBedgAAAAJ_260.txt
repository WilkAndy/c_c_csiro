Nine of these strains produced a novel highly unsaturated straight chain hydrocarbon as the major non-saponifiable neutral lipid component. The compound was identified as hentriacontanonene (n-C31.9) by mass spectrometry and the formation of n-C31:0 following hydrogenation. The occurrence of n-C31:9 also correlated with the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by the bacterial strains. n-C31:9 may therefore represent a novel biomarker for the location of PUFA-producing bacteria from environmental samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2313576308726141465", "cites_id": ["2313576308726141465"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/125/2-3/281/538805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GZJhGmV5GyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
