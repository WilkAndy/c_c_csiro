In this article we describe the creation of a canola (Brassica napus) variety producing fish oil-like levels of DHA in the seed. This was achieved by the introduction of a microalgal/yeast transgenic pathway of seven consecutive enzymatic steps which converted the native substrate oleic acid to \u03b1-linolenic acid and, subsequently, to EPA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and DHA. This paper describes construct design and evaluation, plant transformation, event selection, field testing in a wide range of environments, and oil profile stability of the transgenic seed. The stable, high-performing event NS-B50027-4 produced fish oil-like levels of DHA (9\u201311%) in open field trials of T3 to T7 generation plants in several locations in Australia and Canada. This study also describes the highest seed DHA levels reported thus far and is one of the first examples of a deregulated genetically modified crop with clear health benefits to the consumer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:dFKc6_kCK1wC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=739504914252899263", "cites_id": ["739504914252899263"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.00727/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vyOzK80_QwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 8}}
