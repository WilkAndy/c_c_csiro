This technique is based on the principle that particular FA present in prey can be incorporated largely untransformed into predator adipose tissue stores, thereby providing biochemical signatures with which to identify prey species. Several studies of phocid seals and cetaceans have documented vertical stratification in the FA composition of blubber such that inferences about diet may vary greatly depending on the layer of the blubber that is analysed. It is not known whether blubber in otariid seals (fur seals and sea lions) also displays vertical stratification in FA composition. Furthermore, it is not known whether the FA composition of blubber is uniform in these species. In the present study, the vertical and regional variation in FA composition of blubber was investigated in seven adult female \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15951316871248587553", "cites_id": ["15951316871248587553"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-005-0484-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Iat3Qi52Xt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
