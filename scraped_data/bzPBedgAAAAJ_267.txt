Fish oil capsule products common to Australia and New Zealand were purchased in May 2016 in Richmond, Victoria, Australia. Products were from two groups; five standard fish oil products and five fish oil concentrates. Noting Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) requirement for use of standard methods, for all analyses undertaken a laboratory was selected that met the TGA criteria, including with accreditation. Total n-3 content exceeded the label-claimed content for all 10 products, with supplements containing on average 124% of the claimed content (range 115%\u2013136%); eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) content averaged 109% of the label claim (range 99%\u2013119%). All 10 products (100%) similarly met the international recommended peroxide value (PV) level. Anisidine value (pAV) met the international recommended level for eight of the 10 products, with two products known to contain flavorings that interfere with the pAV test. When accredited laboratories and standard protocols are used, Australian and New Zealand fish oil products have been shown to clearly meet their label claims for EPA + DHA content, and are not oxidized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:vnF2_uLGgtgC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15658098736597213163", "cites_id": ["15658098736597213163"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/164390", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:65_ePNe9TNkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
