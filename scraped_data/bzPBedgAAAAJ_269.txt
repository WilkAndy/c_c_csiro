Sub-dermal tissue of whale sharks was low in lipid content (4.0 mg g-1 dry mass) and dominated by phospholipids (72% of total lipids), with a calculated energy density of 18.7 kJ g-1 dry mass. There was significant intraspecific variability in fatty acid profiles of whale sharks, with cluster analysis identifying 4 distinct groups in 2013 and 5 groups in 2014. As this variability was not related to sex or size-class, we suggest that it may be attributed to differences in the feeding habitats used by these groups of whale sharks. Variation in dietary patterns was also observed between years, likely due to changes in the primary and secondary producers.
