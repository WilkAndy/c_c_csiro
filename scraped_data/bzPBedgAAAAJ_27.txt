Seventy-five bacteria isolated from the estuary were tested for algicidal activity against this and other toxic and non-toxic algal species. Five isolates produced algicidal extracellular exudates. These algicidal species were a Pseudoalteromonas sp.(ACEM 4), a novel Zobellia sp.(ACEM 20), a strain of Cellulophaga lytica (ACEM 21) and 2 Firmicutes: a novel Planomicrobium sp.(ACEM 22) and a strain of Bacillus cereus (ACEM 32). This study is the first time Gram-positive bacteria have been associated with algicidal activities. Further data are presented on an algicidal Pseudoalteromonas species previously isolated from the Huon Estuary (Strain y). Supernatant produced by all 5 strains caused cell lysis and death in G. catenatum vegetative cells.
