In applying fatty acid analysis to ecosystem studies, it is important to have an understanding of the effect diet has on the fatty acid profile of the predator. A feeding experiment, using crustacean and fish as prey for the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, was conducted to evaluate the effect of prey fatty acids on the fatty acid profile of this marine predator. Cuttlefish were fed on a fish diet for the first 29 days, and then changed to a crustacean diet for a further 28 days. Another group of cuttlefish was fed on a crustacean diet for the first 29 days, and then changed to a fish diet for a further 28 days. An analysis of the cuttlefish digestive gland showed that the fatty acid profile reflected that of the prey, with cuttlefish on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4665204817671719060", "cites_id": ["4665204817671719060"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-008-0932-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lIjDeRAjvkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 6}}
