In both stages, the decrease in dry mass of starved larvae and increase in dry mass of Artemia-fed larvae were accompanied by a decrease and increase in lipid content, respectively. Lipid accounted for 6.7% of the decrease in dry mass in starved stage I larvae, which increased to 35.0% in stage II larvae. Also, lipid accounted for 6.2% of the increase in dry mass of fed stage I larvae, increasing to 19.2% in stage II larvae. The major lipid classes in all phyllosoma samples were polar lipids (84.1\u201394.3%) followed by sterols (6.6\u201312.1%; mainly cholesterol). Gravimetrically, fed larvae increased predominantly in polar lipid whereas in starved larvae, polar lipid was the major lipid class catabolized, with the sterol content not changing significantly. Hydrocarbons, wax esters, diacylglyceryl ether, triacylglycerols, and free fatty acids were all minor lipid classes (< 5% of total lipid). Fatty acid analysis showed six major components present; 16: 0, 18: 1n-9, 18: 0, 20: 4n-6 (arachidonic acid; AA), 20: 5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid; EPA) and 22: 6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid; DHA). These fatty acids all increased gravimetrically in fed larvae and decreased in starved larvae. In starved larvae, small decreases were seen in the relative contribution of EPA, DHA, 16: 1n-7, and 18: 1n-9, with AA increasing. In fed larvae, most of the major fatty acids remained at a similar relative level, and larvae were able to accumulate AA and EPA, but not DHA, above the relative level (%) in Artemia.
