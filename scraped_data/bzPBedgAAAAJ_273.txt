Iron-oxidizers were enriched in fluidized-bed reactors (FBR) at 60 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C; and iron-oxidation rates were determined. Ferrous iron oxidation by the microbiota in the original coal material was inhibited above 63 \u02daC. In addition to four iron-oxidizers, closely related to Sulfobacillus spp that had been earlier isolated from the 60 \u00b0C FBR, one heterotroph closely related to Alicyclobacillus spp was isolated. The Alicyclobacillus sp. isolated from the Collie coal mine tolerated a lower pH than known Alicyclobacillus spp and therefore may represent a new species. The optimum temperature for growth of the iron-oxidizing strains was approximately 50 \u00b0C and their maximum temperatures were approximately 60 \u00b0C. The FBR was adjusted to operate at 50 \u00b0C and was inoculated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12241756397658729945", "cites_id": ["12241756397658729945"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-002-1185-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2W1QhZV046kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
