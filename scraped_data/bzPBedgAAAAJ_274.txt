Rotifers were exposed for 24 h to each bacterial strain and to a mixture of the two strains. They were then harvested and their fatty acid compositions were analysed and compared to those of rotifers that had been either starved or fed yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or microalgae Tetraselmis suecica in 2\u2010L glass flasks. Exposure to 1.4 \u00d7 109 cells/ml of the EPA\u2010producing bacterium only resulted in rotifer EPA levels increasing from 0.1% to 1.2% of total dry weight (%dw). Similarly, following exposure to 1.0 \u00d7 109 cells/mL of the DHA\u2010producing bacterium only, rotifer DHA levels increased from below detection to 0.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=793382804553138190", "cites_id": ["793382804553138190"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-7345.1998.tb00652.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DgBLDHWpAgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
