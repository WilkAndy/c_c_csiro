The life cycle of the coastal population, which was reflected in their pattern of lipid storage, was coupled closely to the growth of sea ice. Nauplii entered the sea ice in early autumn and overwintered predominantly as the NIV stage, with triacylglycerol comprising up to 26% of their dry weight (DW). During their rapid development from stages CI to CIV, much smaller quantities (< 2% DW) of triacylglycerol were present. The population underwent a habitat shift from the ice to the water column at the CIV stage, although adults remained close to the ice-water interface. Adults of both sexes initially contained high amounts of triacylglycerol as a proportion of their total lipid (50% in males, 65% in females), but these stores were depleted over the 3 wk-long period of mating and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3882662567380419354", "cites_id": ["3882662567380419354"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v208/p171-182/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GoNqpwj94TUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
