Mature pre-ovulated ovarian follicles of all species were high in lipid content, indicative of large energetic expenditure and high maternal investment. Larger lipid reserves were found in viviparous dogshark (28\u201336% wet weight, ww) compared to oviparous chimaeras (19\u201324% ww) and catshark, F. boardmani (18% ww). Neutral lipids and monounsaturated fatty acids were the main source of lipidic energy during vitellogenesis and gestation. For most species, there was a peak in total lipid content, levels of storage lipids and essential fatty acids at time of ovulation. Interspecific variation of total lipid yolk reserves and lipid class profiles was largely explained by differences in parity mode, reproductive (continuous vs. non-continuous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3962590735531874399", "cites_id": ["3962590735531874399"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-011-1773-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X5ihfUfz_TYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
