Consequently, we predict that survival shortly after settlement depends on food resources being replenished rapidly. In the present study the length of the starvation period on survival in post-puerulus juveniles of the western rock lobster Panulirus cygnus was investigated using laboratory experiments. All experimental pueruli were collected from Seven Mile Beach, Western Australia, using sandwich puerulus collectors. Total lipid, lipid class, fatty acid, total protein and total glycogen analyses were conducted on fed and starved post-puerulus juvenile lobsters, from moult into the first juvenile stage to 30 days post-moult. From a total of 165 samples used in this study, 15 post-puerulus juveniles were sampled initially and five post-puerulus juveniles sampled every \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16136617619856749581", "cites_id": ["16136617619856749581"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-007-0825-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DfTe0zrI8N8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
