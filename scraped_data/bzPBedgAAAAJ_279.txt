Two experiments were conducted in replicated, 300-l hemispherical tanks to determine if larval survival, growth, bacterial or fatty acid profile were improved by feeding non-enriched rotifers or rotifers enriched with algae or commercially available products, as well as the effect of an antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC). Larvae were stocked at 25 l\u22121 and 15 l\u22121 and reared until Day 16 and Day 19 in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In Experiment 1, the feeding treatments were non-enriched rotifers, or rotifers enriched on algae, DHA Selco (a fish oil based emulsion) or RotiMac (dried Schizochytrium). There were no significant differences in mean survival (\u00b1SD) across treatments, which were generally low at 14.6\u00b15.2%. Larvae reared on rotifers fed DHA Selco and RotiMac, had significantly higher proportions of incorporated DHA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18164229224303331681", "cites_id": ["18164229224303331681"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848605004059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YYlexT1OFPwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
