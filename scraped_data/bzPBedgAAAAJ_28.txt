Due to the increased demand for and price of wild-caught marine sources of n-3 LC-PUFA-rich oil, their effective and sustainable replacement in aquafeeds is an industry priority, especially because dietary n-3 LC-PUFA from eating fish are known to have health benefits in human beings. The benefits and challenges involved in changing dietary oil in aquaculture are highlighted and four major potential sources of n-3 LC-PUFA for aquafeeds, other than fish oil, are compared. These sources of oil, which contain n-3 LC-PUFA, specifically EPA (20 : 5n-3) and DHA (22 : 6n-3) or precursors to these key essential fatty acids, are: (1) other marine sources of oil; (2) vegetable oils that contain biosynthetic precursors, such as stearidonic acid, which may be used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15568440789382555315", "cites_id": ["15568440789382555315"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/n3-oil-sources-for-use-in-aquaculture-alternatives-to-the-unsustainable-harvest-of-wild-fish/0BEF421CBBB66FED1B64A3309A9E4971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s2bZrWk2DtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 10, "2011": 14, "2012": 14, "2013": 14, "2014": 25, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 16, "2018": 9, "2019": 19, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
