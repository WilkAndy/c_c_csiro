These are the first lipid biomarker analyses reported for these hydrothermal vent polychaetes. Lipid content was low in all samples (1.6\u201335.9mgg\u20131 wet mass) and was dominated by polar lipid (78\u201390% of total lipid) with 8\u201319% sterol (ST), and very low storage lipid (triacylglycerol and wax ester). Total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were moderately high (22\u201331% of total fatty acids (FA)) with extremely low or no docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(n-3)). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5(n-3)) levels were 5\u20136% in Alvinella pompejana and A. caudata and 10.3\u201313.7% in an errantiate polychaete (likely Hesionidae) and Hesiolyra bergii. There were greater PUFA and a greater EPA/AA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3384860166691874961", "cites_id": ["3384860166691874961"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063705002037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kegJSmNw-S4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
