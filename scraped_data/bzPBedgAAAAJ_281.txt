Particle-associated sterols were extracted onto glass-fibre filters then the filters were supercritical fluid extracted (at 33 MPa, 80\u00b0C for 30 min) followed by pentafluorophenyldimethylsilyl (flophemesyl) derivatization for gas chromatographic\u2013electron-capture detection (GC\u2013ECD). Optimal derivatization of epicoprostanol, coprostanol, cholesterol, dihydrocholesterol, stigmasterol, \u03b2-sitosterol and stigmastanol with neat flophemesyl chloride was achieved under mild conditions (i.e., room temperature, 15 min) without the need for added solvent. These sterols gave linear GC\u2013ECD calibrations (r2\u22650.99) while detection limits in the final solutions were 0.1\u20130.6 \u03bcg/ml. Overall recoveries for the supercritical extraction and derivatization steps were 80\u2013110% (mean 92%). The procedure was applied to raw sewage and to river \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10996070668745289942", "cites_id": ["10996070668745289942"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967398001605", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1rCndwPkmZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
