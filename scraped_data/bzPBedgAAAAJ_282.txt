The yield of oil from the liver was 30-64% (wet weight) for M. antarcticus and 50-53% (wet weight) for G. galeus. Lipid classes were determined by thin-layer chromatography with flame ionization detection, with the major lipid being triacylglycerol (\u226595%); other minor lipids were polar lipid, wax ester, sterol (mainly cholesterol) and free fatty acid. Long-chain \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids accounted for between 33% and 39% of the total fatty acids in all three species, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations were between 13% and 18%.
