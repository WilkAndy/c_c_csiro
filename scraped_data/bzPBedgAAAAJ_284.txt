Neocyttus helgae, landed in North Atlantic waters, was also analysed. Similar analyses were also carried out on the muscle and swim bladder of the orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus from both Australian and North Atlantic waters. Orange roughy is currently a major commercial species in southern Australia and is a new-fishery in the North Atlantic; there are four species of oreo of increasing commercial significance in Australia due to orange roughy quota reductions. It is therefore necessary to determine if the oreo fishing industry is capable of supplementing the current orange roughy requirements with respect to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8432593080596040485", "cites_id": ["8432593080596040485"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049195000243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JQtYoLqWBnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
