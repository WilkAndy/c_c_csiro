The detection of these compound classes in these sediments further extends the range of environments within which these compound classes occur. Differences in the absolute abundance of these lipid classes are probably due to variations in the abundances of E. huxleyi or related algae (in the case of the unsaturated ketones). These lipid components were below the limits of detection, however, in all sediments collected from a third, estuarine sampling site. This observation is one feature distinguishing the lipid distribution and thus differences in the contributing biota at the three sites. These data highlight the use of the biological marker \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11415486266371646436", "cites_id": ["11415486266371646436"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0146638086900793", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5KNuBUf0a54J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 5, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
