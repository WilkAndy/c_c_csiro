Both techniques show a diet that is closely linked to prey availability and abundance, with some specialisation occurring for Myctophid fishes which dominated the diet numerically and taxonomically. Mean monthly differences in total lipid content of the digestive gland correlated with satellite-derived sea surface chlorophyll, illustrating that the diet is closely linked to short-term (monthly) temporal changes of primary productivity. Multidimensional scaling analysis of prey and T. filippovae signature fatty acid profiles revealed apparent intra-specific predator to prey relationships. Significant season versus site interactions for various lipid classes and fatty acids were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4503341541172444162", "cites_id": ["4503341541172444162"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064512001117", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AvzXn0UVfz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
