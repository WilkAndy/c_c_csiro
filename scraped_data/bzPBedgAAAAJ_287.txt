Triacylglycerol levels were always <2%, sterols <7%, free fatty acids varied between 2 and 33%, and polar lipids were the most abundant lipid class (>51% of total lipids). The major fatty acids in C. marina were palmitic (16:0), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5\u03c93), octadecatetraenoic (18:4\u03c93), myristic (14:0), and palmitoleic (16:1\u03c97c) acids. Higher levels of EPA were found in ruptured cells (21.4\u201329.4%) compared to intact cells (8.5\u201325.3%). In general, Japanese N\u2010118 C. marina was the highest producer of EPA (14.3\u201329.4%), and Mexican CMCV\u20101 the lowest producer (7.9\u201327.1%).
