This pathway is noteworthy for both the production of ARA in seed tissue and the low levels of intermediate C20 fatty acids that accumulate. We also demonstrate that the arachidonic acid is naturally enriched at the sn2 position in triacylglycerol. This is the first report of ARA production by the \u03949-elongase pathway in an oilseed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10032599304882318054", "cites_id": ["10032599304882318054"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11248-011-9517-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5mpXrenzOosJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
