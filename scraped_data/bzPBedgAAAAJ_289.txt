Overall, Hg concentrations were greatest in fish (0.01\u20130.30\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g\u20131 ww) (with highest content found in barracouta (Thyrsites atun) and whiptails (Coelorinchus fasciatus)), compared with cephalopods (0.01 and 0.17\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g\u20131 ww) and crustaceans (<0.04\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g\u20131 ww). Lipid composition varied between species and within habitat (mesopelagic, bathypelagic and benthic). Mean total lipid content ranged from 0.5 to 13.2% ww, and in most species was dominated by triacylglycerols and phospholipids. In fish and squid, fatty acids were generally dominated by monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas crustaceans were higher in polyunsaturated fatty acids.
