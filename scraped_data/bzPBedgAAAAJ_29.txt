Research to date confirms the novelty of bacteria isolated from this extreme environment. Opportunities now exist to exploit these and other findings to develop possible new biotechnological products from Antarctic microorganisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 190, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12432323234170408687", "cites_id": ["12432323234170408687"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166999800421", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7w6QuRx8iKwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 6, "2002": 18, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 14, "2006": 11, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 15, "2013": 6, "2014": 18, "2015": 12, "2016": 8, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 3}}
