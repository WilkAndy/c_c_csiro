The 16S rRNA gene of five of the strains was partially sequenced. The strains isolated from the reactor were closely related (99% similarity in gene sequence) to Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and the strains isolated directly from the coal had a 97% gene sequence similarity to \u201cSulfobacillus yellowstonensis\u201d. The sequenced strains each had an optimum temperature for growth using an organic carbon source of approximately 50 \u00b0C and a maximum temperature for growth of approximately 60 \u00b0C. All strains required a mixotrophic medium for growth on Fe2+ or on an organic carbon source. Of the five strains tested, all grew on pyrite whereas only three of the strains grew on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15692496589514234921", "cites_id": ["15692496589514234921"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687502001309", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KVwGeYHyxtkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 7, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
