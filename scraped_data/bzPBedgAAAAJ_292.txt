Water samples were also collected to identify possible sources of faecal contamination. Bay sediments had total fatty acid concentrations between 4 and 183 \u00b5g g\u20131 (dry weight) and total sterol concentrations between 0.6 and 39.2 \u00b5g g\u20131. Creek sediments contained more sterols, ranging from 22.8\u2013148 \u00b5g g\u20131. These lipid distributions suggest that the bulk of the labile organic matter derives from marine microalgae, primarily diatoms. Coprostanol (5\u03b2-cholestan-3\u03b2-ol), a sterol often used as an indicator of faecal contamination, was also present. Concentrations ranged from <0.01\u20130.55 \u00b5g g\u20131 in surface sediments, with values over 0.25 \u00b5g g\u20131 and 5\u03b2-/5\u03b1-C27 stanol ratios greater than 0.4, indicative of sewage inputs.
