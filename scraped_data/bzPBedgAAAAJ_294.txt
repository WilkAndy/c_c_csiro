This species is only the second prokaryote that has been found to contain chlorophylls a and b. Its lipid composition is similar to that of another prochlorophyte, Prochloron didemni Lewin, as well as to some cyanobacteria and bacteria, but there are also some unique features. Major fatty acids were 14:0, 14: 1\u03c95, 16:0, 16: 1\u03c97 and two novel fatty acids 16: 1\u03c912 (hexadec\u20104\u2010enoic acid) and a new 16:2 isomer. Double bond positions in monounsaturated fatty acids and alkenes were determined by derivatization with dimethyl disulfide followed by analysis of the products by gas chromatography\u2010mass spectrometry. Hydrocarbons consisted mainly of the pentacyclic triterpene hop\u201022(29)\u2010ene and straight\u2010chain n\u2010heptadecane and n \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16985206345769083338", "cites_id": ["16985206345769083338"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1988.tb04261.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yuFGFC6Tt-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
