In this study, dietary variation within and between years was studied with fatty acid signature analysis (FASA), stomach content analysis (SCA) and stable isotope analysis (SIA). We profiled the fatty acid (FA) composition of whole blood collected from adult penguins throughout the breeding season, and from chicks during the cr\u00e8che period, in 2001 and 2002. Differences were detected in FA profiles between years, breeding stage and age (adults vs. chicks). These patterns broadly corresponded to those observed from SCA and SIA, with a mix of krill and fish consumed in the early part of the breeding season in both years, krill dominating the diet during the chick-rearing periods in 2001, and fish in 2002. Different metabolic and physiological demands between stages, and ages, may also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3559979897117187568", "cites_id": ["3559979897117187568"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098108004310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8J0z19qWZzEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
