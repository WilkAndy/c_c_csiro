We investigated if Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) digest and accumulate dietary phytosterols in significant amounts in muscle and liver. Phytosterols are lipid soluble, lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in humans. We aimed to determine if fatty fish, such as salmon, can be used as a delivery source of this functional food component. Three diets containing canola oil (CO), Echium oil (EO) and fish oil (FO) were fed to Atlantic salmon smolt over 9 weeks. The digestibility of natural abundances of phytosterols by Atlantic salmon was poor compared to cholesterol. However, phytosterols accumulated in liver and muscle of fish. Significantly increased concentrations of 24\u2010methylenecholesterol, campesterol, \u03b2\u2010sitosterol and total \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13752230895339326638", "cites_id": ["13752230895339326638"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-008-3175-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rkzaCSO92b4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
