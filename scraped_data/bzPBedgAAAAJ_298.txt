Tissue samples were taken from 40 Merino ewe and wether lambs sired by Black Suffolk, Dorset, Merino and White Suffolk rams. FA proportion (% total FA) showed significant variations. The highest relative concentrations of total saturated fatty acid (SFA) were in adipose tissue, concentrations of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were highest in muscle and concentrations of two nutritionally important omega-3 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated FA (LC-PUFA), namely, eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6n-3) acids, were highest in kidney tissue (10.4% total FA), as were those of total PUFA in heart tissue. Sire breed variations in kidney for 18:3n-3, 22:6n-3, 16:0, 16:1n-7c \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_tF6a-HnqWAC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10364223371193402576", "cites_id": ["10364223371193402576"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/AN14906", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0MTIfD4e1Y8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
