Because lipid content influences \u03b413C, lipids should be removed from lipid-rich samples before \u03b413C analysis. To account for differences in \u03b413C arising from differences in lipid content, relationships between lipid content, C:N ratio and \u0394\u03b413C with lipid removal can be used to normalise lipid content to uniform levels. We investigate these relationships for salmonid muscle and evaluate the suitability of previously published normalisation equations for these fish. Salmonids with a wide range of condition (muscle lipid content = 3\u201335% of dry weight) were considered. There were no consistent relationships between lipid content or C:N ratio and \u0394\u03b415N. There were linear relationships between C:N ratio and lipid content (L = \u221216.53 + 6.27 \u00d7 C:N); C:N ratio and \u0394\u03b413C (\u0394\u03b413C = \u22121.87 + 0.65 \u00d7 C:N); and lipid content and \u0394\u03b413C (\u0394\u03b413C = 0.01 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5606254944554865191", "cites_id": ["5606254944554865191"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-011-1789-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J1J4OitrzU0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
