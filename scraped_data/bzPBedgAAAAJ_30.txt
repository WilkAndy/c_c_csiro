Type I methanotroph PLFA profiles contained a number of unusual monenoic 16-carbon fatty acids. Significant levels of 16: 1\u03c98c were found in Methylomonas methanica (41%), Methylomonas fodinarum (26%), Methylomonas aurantiaca (30%) and \u2018Methylomonas agile\u2019 (14%). High levels of 16: 1\u03c96c, 16: 1\u03c95c and 16: 1\u03c95t were also detected in most Methylomonas and Methylococcus strains. The type II methanotroph \u2018Methylosinus trichosporium\u2019 possessed the unusual PLFA 18: 1\u03c98c as its major polar lipid. Certain type II methanotrophs contained (\u03c9-1)-OH fatty acids with chain lengths varying from 26 to 30 carbon atoms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13778479531493935140", "cites_id": ["13778479531493935140"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/85/1/15/470037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JMiv4yH-Nr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 10, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
