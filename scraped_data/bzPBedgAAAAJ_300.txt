Field observations have shown seaweeds to be highly susceptible to marine heatwaves, but the physiological drivers of this susceptibility are poorly understood. Furthermore, the effects of marine heatwaves in conjunction with ocean warming and acidification are yet to be investigated. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a laboratory culture experiment in which we tested the growth and physiological responses of Phyllospora comosa juveniles from the southern extent of its range (43\u201331\u00b0S) to marine heatwaves, ocean warming and acidification. We used a \u2018collapsed factorial design\u2019 in which marine heatwaves were superimposed on current (today's pH and temperature) and future (pH and temperature projected by 2100) ocean conditions. Responses were tested both during the heatwaves, and after \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:L7vk9XBBNxgC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14498914277339169977", "cites_id": ["14498914277339169977"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uQSkebd9NskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
