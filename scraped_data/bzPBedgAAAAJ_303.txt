Squid were collected during 3 austral summers and 1 austral winter between January 1995 and June 2000. Stomach contents and fatty acid profiles of both mantle and digestive gland tissues were used to determine if the diet of M. ingens was subject to temporal variations in this region. Discriminant analysis (DA) of stomach contents data and digestive gland fatty acid data indicated that the diet varied significantly on an interannual basis, most likely due to an increase in the consumption of the myctophid Gymnoscopelus nicholsi during the summer of 1999 relative to the summers of 1995 and 2000. Comparisons with oceanographic data reveal that the summer of 1999 was a period of warmer sea-surface temperatures and reduced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11477554696275709090", "cites_id": ["11477554696275709090"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v256/p135-149/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:okyhgS93SJ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
