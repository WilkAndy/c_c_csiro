Follicular colonization by malignant MBCs was observed in six specimens of pure MBCL and in 13 specimens of MBCL + FL. Benign MBCs did not express bcl2 by immunohistological methods in 11 of 12 benign specimens. In contrast, weak reactivity for bcl-2 was detected in malignant MBCs in four of five specimens of pure MBCL and in the MBCL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=233815005764144539", "cites_id": ["233815005764144539"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0046817795901671", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m026SYKtPgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
