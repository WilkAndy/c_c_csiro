The bacterium was found to produce the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 18:2\u03c93, 18:3\u03c93 and 20:5\u03c93 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at both growth temperatures. This result suggests that the bacterium possesses both the aerobic and anaerobic pathways for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, where an alternate terminal electron acceptor(s) is utilised in the absence of oxygen."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16757931196877041811", "cites_id": ["16757931196877041811"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/98/1-3/117/584278", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k_BK4KIhkOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
