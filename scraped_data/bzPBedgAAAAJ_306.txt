Studies in microcosms have shown correlations between activity of these organisms, measured by recovery and viable counting, and the degradation of concrete. The \u2018signature\u2019 lipid analysis provides a detection assay requiring neither separation of the organisms from the substratum nor growth prior to determination. The presence of acid-producing thiobacilli was demonstrated in microcosm samples and degenerating concrete from the Hamburg (F.R.G.) sewer system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14044687835316970297", "cites_id": ["14044687835316970297"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article-abstract/2/2/63/5987274", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OWNRnSzB6MIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3}}
