This technique was initially validated at Atlantic salmon farms in Macquarie Harbour, Australia, where sediments were collected at farm and control locations. Subsequently, sediment, benthic polychaete and zooplankton were sampled at sites 0, 50, 250, 500 and 1000 m distant from multiple cages. Results demonstrated an acute deposition zone up to 50 m from cages and a diffuse zone extending 500 m from cages. Changes in sediment concentration of linoleic acid, oleic acid and total fatty acids were effective tracers of farm deposition. Bacterial biomarkers indicated that aquaculture waste stimulates bacterial productivity in sediments, with elevated biomarker concentrations also detected in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:v_tt_AnqfNMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=668315859802743048", "cites_id": ["668315859802743048"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X17304289", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CGFNzbtVRgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
