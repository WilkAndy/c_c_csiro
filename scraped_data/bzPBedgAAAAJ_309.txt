The lack of n-3 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) in VO is a major constraint. Echium oil (EO), rich in stearidonic acid (SDA), has the potential to increase endogeneous n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis. We tested whether feeding Atlantic salmon an EO-based diet in both freshwater and seawater would increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels by comparing the fatty acid (FA) profiles in liver and white muscle to fish fed FO and rapeseed oil (RO)-based diets. The gene expression of n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthetic enzymes was measured to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis. After prolonged feeding with EO diet from freshwater to seawater phases, EO fish had higher n-3 LC-PUFA levels in both liver and white muscle compared to RO fish. However, FO fish had the highest n-3 LC-PUFA levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4933789095872828306", "cites_id": ["4933789095872828306"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848611007228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:khMy2ApXeEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
