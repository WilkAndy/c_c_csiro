Similar variations were recorded for the two species. Significantly higher concentrations of total lipid and total saturated fatty acids were found in summer, while the contents of total n\u20103 and n\u20106 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and total monounsaturated fatty acids were markedly higher in winter and spring. The two predominant n\u20103 PUFAs were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n\u20103; 34\u201343%) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n\u20103; 40\u201353%). The seasonal variation of EPA was similar to that of total n\u20103 PUFA, while the contents of DPA were significantly higher in winter, spring and summer than in autumn. A higher n\u20103/n\u20106 PUFA ratio was found in winter and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15595390947080013666", "cites_id": ["15595390947080013666"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-4522.2006.00063.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YgcMPnD1bdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
