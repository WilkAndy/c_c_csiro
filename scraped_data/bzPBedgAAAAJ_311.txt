Krill collected from Prydz Bay, Antarctica, were subjected to long-term starvation (130 days) upon capture. The total lipid content of starved krill remained relatively constant (1 7-24 mg g\") throughout starvation. Body length decreased signi\ufb01cantly with a reduction of up to 35% and lipid decreased from I 9 to 4.] mg animaF'. No significant differences were detected in levels of triacylglycerol during starvation. There was a signi\ufb01cant decrease in polar lipid levels between Day 0 and Day 5; however, levels did not change signi\ufb01cantly throughout the remainder of the starvation period. Stcrols, predominantly of algal origin, fell \ufb01rom 0.5\u20143.8 pig per animal to trace levels by Day 5 of starvation. Bacterial cultures isolated from the stomach and the hepatopancreas of krill were also analysed and found to contain strains able to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid (20: 5m3) from trace levels to 0. 7% of the total fatty acids. These and related \ufb01ndings may partially explain the high levels (approximately 50% of total fatty acids) of essential fatty acids found in the hepatoparzcreas in this species and the fact that krill are able to utilize food sources de\ufb01cient in essential lipid components (eg Phaeocystis)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8598931823071043126", "cites_id": ["8598931823071043126"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/90430/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Np7zGe-KVXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
