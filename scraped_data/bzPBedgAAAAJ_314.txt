The magnitude of these changes may depend on dietary history including oil sources with different fatty acid compositions. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer (Perciformes, Latidae), a tropical ectothermic fish, was fed on diets either rich in dietary long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from fish oil, rich in stearidonic and \u03b3-linolenic acid (SDA and GLA, respectively) from Echium plantagineum, or rapeseed oil deficient in LC-PUFA. Following 5weeks at the optimum temperature of 30\u00b0C when growth rates were comparable amongst dietary treatments, water temperature was dropped to 20\u00b0C for 1week for half of the animals and maintained at 30\u00b0C for the other half. Decreased temperature increased the liver \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5351408434196609261", "cites_id": ["5351408434196609261"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643313000858", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7XhRMJ4FREoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
