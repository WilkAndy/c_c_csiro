The aim of this paper is to fill this gap on one of the dominant species Pyrosoma atlanticum. Lipid content is tightly coupled to size and weight. Lipid composition shows a large dominance of structural polar lipids. Neutral lipids were dominated by sterols with low levels of acylglycerols and free fatty acids. Phospholipids show a dominance of PC with intermediate percentages of PE and DPG. Other constituents (PS, PI, LPC, sphingolipids) were present at lower levels. Fatty acid composition of DAG and TAG showed a dominance of saturated acids (16:0, 14:0), DHA and intermediate levels of MUFA. Phospholipids were dominated by DHA with values exceeding 30% of total FA in all categories except for PI, where lower percentages occurred. Saturated acids were second in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13023628100891555523", "cites_id": ["13023628100891555523"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-007-3066-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w7ZvcME4vbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
