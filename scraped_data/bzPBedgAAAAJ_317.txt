Five tuna oil/lecithin/water emulsions containing between 0% and 4% (40 mg g\u22121) dry weight (DW) of \u03b1-T were fed to rotifers, resulting in rotifer \u03b1-T concentrations between 114 and 1040 \u03bcg g\u22121 DW. These rotifers or a reference diet of rotifers enriched with AlgaMac 2000 (AM) were fed to larvae from first feeding at 5 days post-hatch (dph) until 23 dph. In larvae fed the emulsion-enriched rotifers, tissue concentrations of \u03b1-T were correlated to dietary concentrations. Larvae at 5 dph contained 276 \u03bcg \u03b1-T g\u22121; concentrations in most larvae had reduced at 23 dph (to between 121 and 225 \u03bcg \u03b1-T g\u22121) except for those fed highest \u03b1-T, which contained 356 \u03bcg g\u22121. Larval weight at 20 dph, and length at 14 and 23 dph were positively correlated with dietary \u03b1-T concentration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8519675205177054324", "cites_id": ["8519675205177054324"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848605000803", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dBRIvnX3O3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
