Trematomus hansoni and Pagothenia borchgrevinki had 2\u20134% skeletal lipid, which comprised 1% of total body lipid. Triacylglycerol was the major lipid class present in all tissues of all fish analyzed (up to 89% of total lipid), with minor components including sterol, phospholipid and wax esters. Monounsaturated fatty acids comprised 38.3\u201358.0% of the total fatty acids, and included primarily oleic [18\u2009:\u20091(n-9)] and palmitoleic [16\u2009:\u20091(n-7)] acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids comprised 19.1\u201340.0% of the total fatty acids and included primarily eicosapentaenoic acid [20\u2009:\u20095(n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [22\u2009:\u20096(n-3)].
