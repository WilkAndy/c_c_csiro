Omega-3 LC-PUFA can prevent mental health issues and chronic human disorders including cancer, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. The median amount of n-3 LC-PUFA consumption is generally lacking in Western diets. More attention is now being paid to the use of innovative nutritional strategies to improve PUFA content in ruminants, which could subsequently increase the content of health-benefitting n-3 LC-PUFA for human consumption. The richest sources of dietary n-3 LC-PUFA are derived from marine products, while forage and oilseeds such as flaxseed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kO05sadLmrgC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10586026393993585429", "cites_id": ["10586026393993585429"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451943X17301552", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FaPlDOse6ZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 13, "2022": 5}}
