A set of genes encoding the fatty acid chain elongation and desaturation enzymes required for the synthesis of LC-PUFA from their C18 PUFA precursors was expressed seed-specifically in Arabidopsis thaliana. This resulted in the synthesis of DHA, the most nutritionally important \u03c93 LC-PUFA, for the first time in seed oils, along with its precursor EPA and the \u03c96 LC-PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA). The assembled pathway utilised \u03945 and \u03946 desaturases that operate on acyl-CoA substrates and led to higher levels of synthesis of LC-PUFA than previously reported with acyl-PC desaturases. This demonstrates the potential for development of land plants as alternative sources of DHA and other LC-PUFA to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15419486112234852370", "cites_id": ["15419486112234852370"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp05084", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EtDTUuwE_dUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 12, "2007": 20, "2008": 15, "2009": 12, "2010": 11, "2011": 13, "2012": 16, "2013": 8, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
