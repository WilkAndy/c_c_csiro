We investigated restoration of EPA and DHA in rainbow trout fed a FOFD preceded by a grow-out period on 50% or 75% palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) diets at optimal (15\u00b0C) or elevated (20\u00b0C) water temperatures. Using the FOFD restored EPA and DHA in fillet and whole carcass of fish previously fed either 50% PFAD diet from 85% to 98% or 75% PFAD from 66% to 93% of values obtained for fish fed FO diet throughout. Water temperature did not influence EPA and DHA restoration. Growing rainbow trout with diets where FO was replaced by either 50% or 75% PFAD followed by a FOFD reduced FO usage by around 30% and 44% at 15\u00b0C, respectively, and 32% and 48% at 20\u00b0C, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9594855231165373655", "cites_id": ["9594855231165373655"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030881461300191X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1xzpPP_FJ4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
