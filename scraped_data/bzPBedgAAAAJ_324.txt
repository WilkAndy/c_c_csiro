Larvae were fed with Artemia enriched with a (i) base enrichment (Base) containing 520\u2003g\u2003kg\u22121 squid oil or tailor made enrichments in which oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) have been added at the expense of squid oil. These treatments were (ii) base enrichment supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rich oil, (iii) base enrichment supplemented with arachidonic acid (AA) rich oil, or (iv) base enrichment supplemented with DHA and AA (D\u2003+\u2003A) rich oils. Total survival of phyllosoma to stage IV was high, with no significant difference between treatments (range 12.3\u201317.5%). By stage IV, the larvae fed the DHA or AA enriched Artemia were significantly larger (3.33\u2003mm length) than larvae fed the Base or D\u2003+\u2003A enriched Artemia (3.18\u20133.24\u2003mm length).
