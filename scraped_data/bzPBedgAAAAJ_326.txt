Using triacylglycerol\u2010rich marine oil nutrient sources and microalgae, Artemia were enriched with the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to ratios similar to that of wild\u2010caught phyllosomata. Artemia enriched by different methods were fed to cultured phyllosomata. At each stage animals were counted, measured and sampled for lipid analyses. Survival was highest from stages II to III (62\u201386%), with mean total survival at 3\u201312%. From stages I to V larvae increased in mass (0.2\u20132.2\u2003mg) and total length (2.1\u20135.8\u2003mm), and decreased in total lipid. The major lipid class in all phyllosomata was polar lipid, followed by sterol, with no triacylglycerol detected. The main fatty acids were 18:1(n\u20109)c, 18:2(n\u20106), 16:0, 18:0, eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA; 20:5(n\u20103)], 18:1(n\u20107)c, arachidonic acid [AA; 20:4(n\u20106)] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11412937027511610286", "cites_id": ["11412937027511610286"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2004.00295.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rmu7GMLlYp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
