Total lipid was highest in E. superba small juveniles (16 mg g\u22121 wet mass), ranging from 12 to 15 mg in other euphausiids. Polar lipid (56\u201381% of total lipid) and triacylglycerol (12\u201338%) were the major lipids with wax esters (6%) only present in E. tricantha. Cholesterol was the major sterol (80\u2013100% of total sterols) with desmosterol second in abundance (1\u201318%). 1997 T. macrura and E. superba contained a more diverse sterol profile, including 24-nordehydrocholesterol (0.1\u20131.7%), trans-dehydrocholesterol (1.1\u20131.5%), brassicasterol (0.5\u20131.7%), 24-methylenecholesterol (0.1\u20130.4%) and two stanols (0.1\u20130.2%). Monounsaturated fatty acids included primarily 18:1(n\u22129)c (7\u201321%), 18:1(n\u22127)c (3\u201313%) and 16:1(n\u22127)c (2\u20137%).
