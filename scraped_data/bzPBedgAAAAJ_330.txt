We assessed changes in nutritional condition in adult, deep-water lobsters before and 12 months after relocation through variations in the lipid and fatty acid profiles in the hepatopancreas and muscle. Fatty acid compositions were similar between shallow and translocated lobsters and both were different from deep-water lobsters, suggesting a dietary difference between the deep and shallow-water lobsters, and a dietary change in deep-water lobsters after translocation. Nutritional condition indices, such as total lipid and triacylglycerol content, did not significantly vary between the lobster populations which may be due to within-population variability driven partly by differences in the moult stage of lobsters.
