However, a lack of standardization of the treatment of samples prior to analysis, hampers comparisons of results within and among studies. This study examined the effects of lipid extraction (LE), acidification for the removal of inorganic carbonate (RIC) and rinsing with deionized water (DIW) on \u03b413C and \u03b415N values and C:N ratios in sub-dermal tissue of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), zooplankton (>200\u20131000 \u03bcm) and a wide range of micronekton (>1000 \u03bcm) taxa collected in 2013 and 2014 at Ningaloo Reef (Western Australia). For whale shark tissue, lipid extraction (LE and LE + DIW) increased values of \u03b413C, whereas LE, LE + DIW and DIW treatments increased values of \u03b45N and C:N ratios. These results confirm the need to remove lipids and 15N-depleted nitrogenous waste from elasmobranch tissues.
