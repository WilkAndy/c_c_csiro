Lipid and fatty acid content and composition were determined in field and laboratory samples. Developmental stages analyzed in embryos included: multiple-cell, gastrula, and limb-bud stages. Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100%), lowest in group 1 (0%), and highly variable in field samples (0\u201348%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4713724404135213829", "cites_id": ["4713724404135213829"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-011-1735-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BbuRBV-DakEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
