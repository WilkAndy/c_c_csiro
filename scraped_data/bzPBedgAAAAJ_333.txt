To compare the influence of herbivory and carnivory on krill we conducted a nine month feeding trial. We examined lipid composition of the hepatopancreas, abdomen and remaining body portions of krill fed diatoms at bloom condition levels, and diatoms with the addition of pellets or minced clam meat to simulate a partly carnivorous diet. Mortality, dry mass and lipid content were similar among treatments. We examined lipid class and fatty acid profiles, with emphasis placed on the ratio of storage (triacylglycerol) to structural (polar lipid) lipid and key essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: 20:5\u03c93 and 22:6\u03c93. The triacylglycerol : polar lipid ratio increased in krill fed on the mixed diet as did the 20:5\u03c93 : 22:6\u03c93 ratio. Overall these findings indicate that provision of clam in the diet improved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4771409490385268975", "cites_id": ["4771409490385268975"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/effect-of-a-carnivorous-diet-on-the-lipids-fatty-acids-and-condition-of-antarctic-krill-euphausia-superba/6FF2D032BEBF62F3B916C72337BE1AD2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:73BXyKZzN0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
