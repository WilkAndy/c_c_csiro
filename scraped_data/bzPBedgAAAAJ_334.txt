Rotifers were enriched using seven experimental emulsions formulated with increasing concentrations of n\u22123 LC\u2010PUFA, mainly 20\u22365n\u22123 and 22\u22366n\u22123. Enriched rotifer n\u22123 LC\u2010PUFA concentrations ranged from 10\u201330 mg/g dry matter. Enriched rotifers were fed to striped trumpeter larvae from 5 to 18 d post\u2010hatch (dph) in a short\u2010term experiment to minimize gross deficiency symptoms such as poor survival that could confound results. No relationships were observed between larval growth or survival with dietary n\u22123 LC\u2010PUFA at 18 dph. The larval FA profiles generally reflected those of the rotifer diet, and significant positive regressions were observed between most dietary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8315528189455076328", "cites_id": ["8315528189455076328"], "pub_url": "https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11745-004-1222-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Is3rNSwZnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 9, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
