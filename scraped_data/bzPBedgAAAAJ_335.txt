Feeding phyllosomata on Artemia salina Linnaeus, 1758, enriched with (1) a triacylglycerol (TAG)-rich A1 DHA Selco\u2013Chaetoceros muelleri Lemmermann, 1898, nutrient source or (2) a formulated ethyl ester (EE)-rich nutrient source was compared with the more novel approach of using a formulated mussel powder\u2013polar lipid diet attached to mesh. Individuals showed an increase to stage V in dry mass (0.1\u20131.5 mg) and total length (2.1\u20136.1 mm). Survival of Artemia-fed phyllosomata was high (92\u201398% from stages II\u2013III; 49% mean total survival). Animals fed the mussel powder\u2013polar lipid diet had low molt success, although the presence of faecal trails confirmed they were consuming the diet. Total lipid remained generally constant in Artemia-fed phyllosomata from newly hatched to stage V (155 mg g\u20131 dry mass); this was notably higher than observed for previous feeding trials. The major lipid class in all phyllosomata samples was polar lipid, followed by sterol, with TAG as a minor component only, and EE not detected. The main fatty acids were 18: 1 (n-9) c, 18: 2 (n-6), 16: 0, eicosapentaenoic acid [20: 5 (n-3)], 18: 0, 18: 1 (n-7) c, arachidonic acid [20: 4 (n-6)], and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA; 22: 6 (n-3)]. Levels of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), namely, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and, in particular, DHA, decreased, on both a relative and absolute basis, from newly hatched to stage V, although phyllosomata fed the EE-rich enriched Artemia diet showed higher essential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11378694455641825789", "cites_id": ["11378694455641825789"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Nichols-2/publication/288656900_Feeding_southern_rock_lobster_Jasus_edwardsii_Hutton_1875_phyllosomata_in_culture_Recent_progress_with_lipid-enriched_Artemia/links/56afd16008ae9c1968b48b26/Feeding-southern-rock-lobster-Jasus-edwardsii-Hutton-1875-phyllosomata-in-culture-Recent-progress-with-lipid-enriched-Artemia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_eE8DFI-6Z0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
