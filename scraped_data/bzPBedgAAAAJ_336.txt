Ratios of eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] to docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3)] were also less (0.5) for abducted than free-living S. australis (1.4). The polyunsaturated fatty acid 14:3 was detected for the first time in both abducted and free S. australis. A number of odd chain fatty acids were also detected, particularly 17:1 (up to 3.6% of total fatty acids) and also 15:0, 17:0, i17:0, and i19:0. The major sterols in the amphipod host, Hyperiella dilatata, included cholesterol (52\u201355% of total sterols) and trans-dehydrocholesterol (33\u201338%), whereas in S. australis (both free and abducted) the major sterols included trans-dehydrocholesterol (23\u201337%), brassicasterol (14\u201327%), and cholesterol (13\u201319%). The sterol profile of H. dilatata is consistent with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11499635187431009176", "cites_id": ["11499635187431009176"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049199001200", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mGtoeUbplp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
