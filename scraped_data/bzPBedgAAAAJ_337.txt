With the development of shipboard and in situ instrumentation for continuous measurements, it is now possible to identify important features, collect relevant samples, and modify the sampling protocol on the basis of an immediate feedback of data. Examples are presented here of instrument systems that provide continuous data in the horizontal and vertical domains.Two separate systems were used to record simultaneously chlorophyll \u03b1 fluorescence and standard hydrological data. For coastal waters, we coupled a submersible data-logger to an in situ fluorometer. For deeper monitoring, a fluorometer and a pH sensor were deployed as part of a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system. The advantages of simultaneous measurements are that data analysis is simplified, and changes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4473141612811999191", "cites_id": ["4473141612811999191"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304420389901862", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:11et3ZjKEz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
