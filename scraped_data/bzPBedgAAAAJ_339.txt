This dataset allowed comparison between seasons, years (2013\u20132016), and different fishing locations. Quantities of omega 3 fatty acids 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 (mg/g dry mass; DM) were highest in autumn and decreased through winter to reach a spring low. Quantities of the flagellate marker 18:4n-3 and diatom marker 16:1n-7c were variable and did not display the same seasonal fluctuations. In summer, krill had high percentages (% total fatty acids) of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, total PUFA, and low 18:1n-9c/18:1n-7c ratios, indicating a more herbivorous diet. Krill became more omnivorous from autumn to spring, indicated by increasing ratios of 18:1n-9c/18:1n-7c and percentages of \u03a3 20:1 + 22:1 isomers. Bacterial fatty acids (\u03a3 C15 + C17 + C19 isomers) were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WIXB4To3Tx4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8227254308890012760", "cites_id": ["8227254308890012760"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article-abstract/38/6/662/5060253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WOwwPjQULXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
