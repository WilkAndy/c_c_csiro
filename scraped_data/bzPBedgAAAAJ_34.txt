Five species (Pavlova pinguis, Heterocapsa niei, Proteomonas sulcata, Navicula jeffreyi and Thalassiosira pseudonana) produced high proportions of triacylglycerol (TAG: 22\u201357% total lipid). An unidentified Navicula-like diatom (CS-786), despite having a low TAG content, had the highest EPA yield (5.8 mg L\u22121), due to high biomass and a high relative proportion of EPA. Heterocapsa niei had the highest DHA yield (2.9 mg L\u22121), due to a high cellular lipid and DHA content (171 pg cell\u22121 and 13.7 pg cell\u22121, respectively) despite its relatively low biomass. The desirable PUFA composition and yield of both diatom CS-786 and H. niei make them potential candidates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1761482755551197286", "cites_id": ["1761482755551197286"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-005-6625-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZviawjsLchgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 13, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 10, "2015": 24, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 12, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
