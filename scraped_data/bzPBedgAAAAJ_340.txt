But new sources are needed, with recent developments with novel land plants showing promise. The value of existing and future sources LC omega\u20103 oils occurs through aquaculture, livestock and other feeding. There is also a need toenhance the stability of oils containing LC omega\u20103 oils. Challenges include increasing DHA levels in land plants, increasing oxidative stability in food products and product labeling. Consumers have difficulty recognizing and differentiating long\u2010chain and shorter\u2010chain (SC, C18) omega\u20103 PUFA, both of which are referred to as \u201comega\u20103\u201d fatty acids."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7334883090181310257", "cites_id": ["7334883090181310257"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lite.201100091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:McdGA0-9ymUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
