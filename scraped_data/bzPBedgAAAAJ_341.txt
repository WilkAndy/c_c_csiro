Evidence of heterogeneous feeding patterns of east coast of Australia migrating humpback whales has been observed, warranting a comprehensive assessment of interannual variability in their diet. We examined the lipid and fatty acid profiles of individuals of the east coast of Australia migrating stock sampled between 2008 and 2018. The use of live-sampled blubber biopsies showed that fatty acid profiles varied significantly among all years. The two trophic indicator fatty acids for Antarctic krill, 20:5\u03c93 and 22:6\u03c93 remained largely unchanged across the 10-year period, suggesting that Antarctic krill is the principal prey item. A distance-based linear model showed that 33% of the total variation in fatty acid profiles was explained by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yCjxvIMm6_oC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7355994398457559625", "cites_id": ["7355994398457559625"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75370-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SXrTge69FWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
