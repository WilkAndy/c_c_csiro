Sixty dual-purpose prime lambs including purebred Merino and crossbred lambs were allocated to one of five treatments of lucerne hay basal diet supplemented with isocaloric and isonitrogenous wheat-based pellets. Treatments were: no oil inclusion (Control); 2.5% canola oil; 5% canola oil; 2.5% flaxseed oil and 5% flaxseed oil, with lamb groups balanced by breed and gender. Each lamb was daily supplemented with 1kg of pellets and had free access to lucerne hay and water throughout the 7-week feeding trial, after a 3-week adaptation. Individual animal basal and supplementary pellet feed intakes were recorded daily, while body conformation traits, body condition scores and liveweights were measured on days 0, 21, 35 and 49. The lambs were dye-banded on the mid-side and shorn before commencing the feeding trial and mid-side wool samples were collected from the same dye-banded area of each lamb at the end of the experiment. Correlations between wool quality traits and lamb performance were non-significant (P>0.05). Oil supplementation had no detrimental effect on lamb growth and wool quality traits (P > 0.05). Gender significantly affected wither height gain and fibre diameter. There were significant interactions between oil supplementation and lamb breed on chest girth. The correlations between clean fleece yield (CFY) and other wool quality traits were moderate ranging from 0.29 to 0.55. Moderate to high correlations between fibre diameter (FD) and other wool quality traits \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:CRzUtm-VnGAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10926933863636199326", "cites_id": ["10926933863636199326"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208229", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nuc4onREpJcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
