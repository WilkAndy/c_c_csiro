The input of terrestrially derived n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into marine environments has subsequently increased, with unknown consequences for recipient species. We exposed a sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma to three experimental diets for 78 days: a high n-3 PUFA marine imitation treatment, a high n-6 PUFA \u201cfuture aquafeed\u201d treatment and an intermediate \u201ccurrent aquafeed\u201d treatment. Female urchins fed the high n-6 PUFA diet produced larvae with lower survival rates than all other treatments. Males fed the high n-6 PUFA diet produced no viable sperm. Fatty acid composition in reproductive material revealed comprehensive biosynthetic and dietary sparing capabilities in H. erythrogramma. Despite this, the ratio of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA in reproductive tissue increased significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:eH23hyXCXa4C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17456510539297052209", "cites_id": ["17456510539297052209"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113616301726", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mdap0Nj7QfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
