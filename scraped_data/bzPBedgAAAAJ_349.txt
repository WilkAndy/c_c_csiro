Ramprasath et al. (Lipids Health Dis 12: 178, 2013) have recently compared use of KO and FO in a trial with healthy individuals to examine which oil is more effective in increasing n-3 PUFA, decreasing the n-6:n-3 ratio and improving the omega-3 index. The authors concluded that KO was more effective than FO for all three criteria. However, careful examination of the fatty acid profiles of the oils used showed that the FO used was not a typical FO; it contained linoleic acid as the dominant fatty acid (32%) and an n-6:n-3 ratio of >1. Due to the fatty acid profile being non-representative of typically commercially marketed FO, the conclusions presented by Ramrasath et al. (Lipids Health Dis 12: 178, 2013) are not justified and misleading. Considerable care is needed in ensuring that such comparative trials do not use inappropriate ingredients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17954602768338490483", "cites_id": ["17954602768338490483"], "pub_url": "https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-13-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c5QPGheQK_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
