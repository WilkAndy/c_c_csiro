Phenotypic analysis showed that the strains isolated formed two distinct taxa. The first taxon included nonmotile, nutritionally fastidious strains that were isolated from the pycnocline of Burton Lake. The cells of these strains were morphologically variant, ranging from vibrioid to ring shaped to coiled and filamentous; in addition, the strains were unable to metabolize carbohydrates or polysaccharides and had DNA G+C contents of 27 to 29 mol%. The strains of the second taxon, which were isolated from sea ice cores and from ice algal biomass, were saccharolytic, exhibited rapid gliding motility, were rodlike to filamentous, and had DNA G+C contents of 36 to 38 mol%.
