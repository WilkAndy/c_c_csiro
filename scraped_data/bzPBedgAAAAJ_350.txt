The presence of a wide range of monounsaturated components was confirmed and the technique offers a simple, rapid, alternative approach for the identification of monounsaturated isomers in both complex microbial and geochemical mixtures and dietary fats."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10535672300301601594", "cites_id": ["10535672300301601594"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167701285900132", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OktmASM6NpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 4, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
