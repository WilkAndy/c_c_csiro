Ocean acidification, caused by sequestration of carbon dioxide into ocean surface waters (pCO2), alters the lipid biochemistry of some organisms. This can have cascading effects up the food chain. In a year-long laboratory experiment adult krill were exposed to ambient seawater pCO2 levels (400 \u03bcatm), elevated pCO2 levels mimicking near-future ocean acidification (1000, 1500 and 2000 \u03bcatm) and an extreme pCO2 level (4000 \u03bcatm). Total lipid mass (mg g\u22121 DM) of krill was unaffected by near-future pCO2. Fatty acid composition (%) and fatty acid ratios associated with immune responses and cell membrane fluidity were also unaffected by near-future pCO2, apart from an increase in 18:3n-3/18:2n-6 ratios in krill in 1500 \u03bcatm pCO2 in winter and spring.
