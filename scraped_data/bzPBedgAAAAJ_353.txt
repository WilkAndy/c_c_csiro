Improving farming requires identifying triploid specific phenotypic and physiological traits that are uniquely derived from ploidy per se and developed under optimal growing conditions. This study investigated firstly, the impact of ploidy on growth performance and whole body composition of Atlantic salmon at different early freshwater stages [34 dph (days post-hatching) alevin, 109 dph fry, and 162 dph parr] and secondly, whether phenotypic differences at these stages were reflected in protein samples collected from whole fish, white muscle or liver tissue. Female diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (n = 3) were first fed at 35 dph and then maintained by feeding to satiation on commercial feeds. Triploids were significantly lower in weight at the late alevin and fry stages but matched diploid weight at the parr stage. The whole-body lipid content was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:QaSi33NTfwYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15105929480466228547", "cites_id": ["15105929480466228547"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744117X17300217", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q2VK7dMKo9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
