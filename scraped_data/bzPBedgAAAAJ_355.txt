Using milk fatty acids (FA) obtained from 29 satellite-tracked fur seals, we characterised the FA composition of seals that foraged on the continental shelf, and those that foraged in oceanic waters. Seals that foraged within oceanic waters were characterised by milk being comparatively high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; 47.4\u00b14.4%, mean\u00b1SD), and lower in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; 23.8\u00b14.0%) when compared to seals that foraged in continental shelf waters (MUFA 36.7\u00b15.4 and PUFA 31.4\u00b15.5%). Based on FA compositions, we predicted the likelihood that milk samples collected at random (n= 131) represented individual seals having foraged either on the continental shelf or in distant oceanic waters.
