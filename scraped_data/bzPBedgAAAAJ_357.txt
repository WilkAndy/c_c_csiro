Stomach-content analysis is a traditional means by which trophic relationships may be examined. This approach is limited however, by the absence and/or rapid digestion of food items in the consumers\u2019 stomach, particularly for purseseine caught predators, and provides only a snapshot of daily feeding. Furthermore, the scarcity of studies in the main tropical and temperate oceans (eg Indian Ocean) has restricted comparisons between open ocean systems. Therefore, techniques that can provide detailed prey information from the tissues of the predator would greatly contribute to our understanding of trophic connections within and between oceans. Signature fatty acids are showing promise in this area, as once the lipid profiles of a particular prey group are identified they can be used to help elucidate the feeding history of the predator, allowing broad comparisons from relatively few data (Bradshaw et al., 2003;"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9303445197029998418", "cites_id": ["9303445197029998418"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30677635/10.1.1.134.6845.pdf#page=76", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Un9JbB16HIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
