The isolates were non-pigmented, curved rod-like cells which exhibited psychrophilic and facultative anaerobic growth and possessed an absolute requirement for sea water. One isolate was able to form gas vesicles. All strains synthesized the 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22:63, DHA) (0\u00b77\u20138\u00b70% of total fatty acids). Previously, DHA has only been detected in strains isolated from deep-sea benthic and faunal habitats and is associated with enhanced survival in permanently cold habitats. The G+C content of the DNA from the Antarctic Colwellia strains ranged from 35 to 42 mol% and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses indicated that the isolates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3397894692680272852,5700742565341304260", "cites_id": ["3397894692680272852", "5700742565341304260"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/00207713-48-4-1171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1ItkXTi_Jy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 12, "2003": 6, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 11, "2016": 3, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 5}}
