Samples analysed included commercially dried kelp, fresh kelp collected using SCUBA and beach cast kelp. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ranged between 57% of the total fatty acids in the fresh sample to 22% in the beach sample. The major PUFAs were 18:3\u03c9 3, 20:4\u03c96 and 20: 5\u03c93. PUFAs decreased while total saturated fatty acids (14:0,16:0,18: 0) increased from 12 to 44% with increasing drying time. Total lipid of fresh kelp was 13 mg g 1\u0304 dry weight, with polar lipid, sterol, triacylglycerol and hydrocarbon comprising 86, 9, 4 and 1 % respectively. Fucosterol was the major sterol found in this species. 24-Ethylcholesta-5,28(29)-dien-3\u03b2, 24-diol and four other unidentified sterols were also detected. Concentrations of both 24-ethylcholesta-5,28(29)-dien-3\u03b2,24-diol and the unidentified sterols increased with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7627251168644363270", "cites_id": ["7627251168644363270"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200903364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BvS654Zw2WkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
