The bacteria were isolated from the non-volcanically but naturally heated waters of the Australian Artesian Basin, volcanically heated waters of New Zealand and the United States and artificially heated waters of a sugar mill. In general, as has been the case of the PLFA profiles of the few thermophilic eubacteria studied to date, a similar preponderance of iso and anteiso saturated branched fatty acids was observed in many of the isolates examined. However, exceptions to this rule were also observed. Notably four thermophilic anaerobic isolates were characterised by the presence of high levels of saturated normal fatty acids (53\u201389% of total PLFA), with evencarbon numbered fatty acids predominating, and one isolate contained high levels (40 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7029278932355061667", "cites_id": ["7029278932355061667"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723202011803048", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oxcpPvIDjWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
