In these systems seaweeds are the ultimate source of energy with any changes in the seaweeds invariably affecting species of higher trophic levels. Seaweeds are rich sources of nutritionally important compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and are particularly rich in long-chain (\u2265 C20) PUFA (LC-PUFA). In southern Australia, the \u2018Great Southern Reef\u2019 has one of the most diverse assemblages of seaweeds in the world, which support highly productive fisheries and have been recognised as a promising resource of omega-3 LC-PUFA. Despite this, there is little information on the biochemical composition of most species and how it varies between sites and seasons. To address this knowledge gap, we undertook a survey to assess seasonal variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:j7XjBeKFbTsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14309875365996893495", "cites_id": ["14309875365996893495"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-020-02302-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N5VbEtTjlsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
