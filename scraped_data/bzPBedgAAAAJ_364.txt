Knowledge of the lipid biochemistry of krill assists in understanding their seasonal biology and predicting their responses to ecological changes. We collected daily samples of krill from a commercial fishing vessel operating in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean from 2014 to 2016. We analysed the total lipid content of krill sampled every two weeks and the relative distribution of lipid class levels to examine seasonal trends. Krill total lipid content varied significantly within and between seasons and sexes. An annual sinusoidal trend was seen in total lipid content with the highest values in autumn and the lowest in spring (average 380 and 87 mg/g dry mass, respectively). Total lipids in krill increased during summer, peaking in autumn, with the total lipids in winter individuals decreasing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:pRWBApOjXDcC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18011391488867667073", "cites_id": ["18011391488867667073"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article-abstract/38/6/673/5142933", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gYxzdCFR9fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
