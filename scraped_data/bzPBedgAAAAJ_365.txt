However, the energy-rich trophic subsidy that aquaculture provides may create cascades with influences over broader spatial scales. In a fjord region with intensive fish farming, we tested whether an ecosystem engineer, the white urchin Gracilechinus acutus, was more abundant at aquaculture sites than control sites. Further, we tested whether diets influenced by aquaculture waste altered reproductive outputs compared with natural diets. Urchins formed barrens at aquaculture sites where they were 10 times more abundant (38 urchins m-2) than at control sites (4 urchins m-2). Urchins were on average 15 mm larger at control sites. In the laboratory, urchins fed aquafeed diets had 3 times larger gonad indices than urchins fed a natural diet. However, their reproduction was compromised \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:pUxgyZctzPYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=415306684181697096", "cites_id": ["415306684181697096"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/aei/v10/p279-289/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SNJ-lzp3wwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
