Information on krill condition during winter and early spring is slowly evolving with our enhanced ability to sample at this time of year. However, because of the limited spatial and temporal data, our understanding of fundamental biological parameters for krill during winter is limited. Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (115\u00b0E\u2013130\u00b0E and 64\u00b0S\u201366\u00b0S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter-moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30\u00b10.02 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3849336288917663790", "cites_id": ["3849336288917663790"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064516300078", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LjD1yfWWazUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
