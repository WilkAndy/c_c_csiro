This study had two main objectives: (1) determine whether feeding Atlantic salmon smolt a 75% palm fatty acid distillate diet (75PFAD) improves the apparent digestibility (AD) of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and (2) examine whether a food deprivation period after growth on 75PFAD leads to higher n-3 LC-PUFA restoration in the fillet when applying a FOFD. The AD of SFA was higher for 75PFAD compared to that of a fish oil (FO) diet. The relative level (as % total fatty acids (FA)) of n-3 LC-PUFA was higher in unfed fish compared to that in continuously fed fish after 21 and 28 day FOFD periods, respectively. Our results suggest that a food deprivation period prior to feeding a FOFD improves the efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA restoration in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10972687194188084979", "cites_id": ["10972687194188084979"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf203633z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8_YOCd7QRpgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
