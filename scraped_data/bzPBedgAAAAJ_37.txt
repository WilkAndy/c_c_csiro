Five strains contained eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5\u03c93) in the range of trace to 3.3% of total fatty acids, and up to 1.4 mg g-1 dry weight. Thirteen strains produced polyunsaturates including 18:2\u03c96, 18:3\u03c93, 18:4\u03c93 and 20:4\u03c96 in the range of trace to 7.0% of total fatty acids. Although the data set is currently small, the proportion of Antarctic strains found to produce PUFA's is higher than that found for temperate marine bacteria (and is similar to that recorded for barophilic bacteria). This suggests that the Antarctic environment has naturally selected for bacterial strains capable of maintaining membrane lipid fluidity by the production of PUFA. These results highlight the potential of Antarctic bacteria for possible consideration in the industrial production of PUFA. These results highlight the potential of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3053272656465780784", "cites_id": ["3053272656465780784"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-in-antarctic-bacteria/70B026AC8BE7B63F62C427BD307B2DCA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MGAO201nXyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 11, "1998": 5, "1999": 12, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
