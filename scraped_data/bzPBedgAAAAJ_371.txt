The lipid composition of the epiphytic material, suspended particulate matter and cultured bacteria from a Posidonia australis community at Corner Inlet, Victoria are presented. 2. 2. The component hydrocarbons, sterols, alcohols, mono-and dicarboxylic fatty acids are reported and indicate that a diverse range of organisms are contributing to the epiphytic and suspended matter samples. 3. 3. Organisms present in the epiphytic population in descending importance are: diatoms> other eucaryotic algae\u22cd invertebrates\u22cd bacteria> seagrass detritus\u22cd fungi> dinoflagellates\u22cd blue green algae. 4. 4. A bacterial biomass of\u2248 40 mg/g has been estimated for the epiphyte sample. The contribution of seagrass (as determined using markers for P. australis) and invertebrates (particularly zooplankton) is more important in suspended particulate matter. 5. 5. The data confirm the view that seagrass detritus is transported from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15004012435509550935", "cites_id": ["15004012435509550935"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049185902135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vx8XwND1ONAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2}}
