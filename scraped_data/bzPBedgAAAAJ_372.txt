These studies focus nearly exclusively on the industry\u2019s target species, overlooking a myriad of non-target organisms that may also be affected. Here, the dietary effects of bait and chum input from the white shark cage-diving industry were assessed for eight non-target species from different functional groups (pelagic fishes, reef fishes, and rays), across two sites with different intensity of wildlife tourism, and compared to a control site with no wildlife tourism. Stomach content, fatty acid profiles, and nitrogen stable isotope values revealed site-specific diets for all eight species, consistent with the consumption of bait and chum at both cage-diving sites. However, these dietary shifts were incongruent with the extent of bait and chum input at North and South Neptune Islands. Species within each functional group responded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5rMqqAh47xYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16067189747470939621", "cites_id": ["16067189747470939621"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719311796", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5bXNnPIf-t4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
