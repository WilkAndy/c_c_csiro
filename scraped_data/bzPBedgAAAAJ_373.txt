Forty-eight lambs balanced by sire breed (Dorset, White Suffolk, Merino) and gender (ewe, wether) were randomly allocated into three dietary supplementation groups (Control- 24 lambs fed wheat/barley-based pellets, Low- 12 animals fed a 50/50 ratio of wheat-based/rice bran pellets, and High- 12 lambs fed rice bran pellets). The Rice bran pellets replaced 19 % of the barley component of the feed. Animals were group-fed at the rate of 1000 g of the supplement per head per day with ad libitum access to lucerne hay as the basal diet and water. The duration of the feeding trial was 49 days with an initial 21-day adjustment period. Sire breed differences were evident for initial (p\u2009<\u20090.0002) and final (p\u2009<\u20090.0016) liveweights, hot carcass (p\u2009<\u20090.0030) and cold carcass (p\u2009<\u20090.0031) weights, as well as dressing percentage (p\u2009<\u20090.0078), fat thickness (p\u2009<\u20090.0467), yield grade (p\u2009<\u20090.0470) and rib eye area (p\u2009<\u20090.0022) with purebred Merino under-performing compared to the crossbreds. Concentrate feed conversion efficiency, costs per unit of liveweight gain and over the hooks income were comparable between treatments regardless of the observed trend where the high supplementation group tended to show lower feed intake (745.8 g/day) compared to both the control (939.9 g/day) and low supplementation groups (909.6 g/day). No significant differences (p\u2009>\u20090.05) were observed between treatments for live animal performance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1189496830595885837", "cites_id": ["1189496830595885837"], "pub_url": "https://janimscitechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40781-015-0069-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DesesRDxgRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
