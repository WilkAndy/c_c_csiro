Barramundi, Lates calcarifer, was fed on a diet rich in preformed long-chain (\u2a7eC20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from fish oil (FO), to compare with diets containing high levels of C18 precursors for LC-PUFA \u2013 stearidonic (SDA) and \u03b3-linolenic acid (GLA) \u2013 from Echium plantagineum (EO), or rapeseed oil (RO) rich in \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), but a poor source of LC-PUFA and their precursors. After 6 weeks, when growth rates were similar amongst the dietary treatments, a sub-lethal dose of Streptococcus iniae was administered to half of the fish, while the other half were maintained unchallenged and were pair-fed with the infected fish. Under a disease challenge situation, the tissue FA depots depleted at 3 days post-infection (DPI) and were then restored to their previous concentrations at 7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13707096952662954723", "cites_id": ["13707096952662954723"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613004986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:45JQHQ5kOb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
