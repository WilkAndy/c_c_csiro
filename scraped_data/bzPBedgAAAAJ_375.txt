Recruitment to adult populations of western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus) is highly variable and is likely to be strongly influenced by shelf width and oceanic conditions affecting cross-shelf transport and nutrition. Since the nutritional status of newly settled pueruli will reflect the phyllosoma feeding environment and distance swum, we studied levels of lipid, fatty acid (FA) and protein of 422 pueruli and 79 first instar juveniles from four Western Australian locations. Lipid levels generally were inversely related to shelf width but were variable, suggesting pueruli may travel complex trajectories to coastal settlement. Lipid and FA composition of pueruli were consistent with spatial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9727410293923351520", "cites_id": ["9727410293923351520"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf08244", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4IvH0R-0_oYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
