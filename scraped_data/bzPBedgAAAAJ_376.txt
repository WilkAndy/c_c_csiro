It analyses legislation through eight'indicatory topics\u2019 and through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, in four voluntarily-participating States: South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia.It proposes a Model Legislative Framework, based on earlier work, to guide development of water resource law in moving towards sustainable rivers. It calls for a catchment agency to manage all impacts on rivers; defined in their fullest sense. It calls for catchment strategic plans, to override conflicting mechanisms. It requires independent regular auditing and public reporting at State and catchment level, against defined provisions. The Framework is based on processes for good governance and systems management, with the onus on stakeholders to develop and deliver sustainable management as the way to ensure sound economies based around river and water resource use."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yTLRzDEmwhEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5806627316685706960", "cites_id": ["5806627316685706960"], "pub_url": "https://library.dbca.wa.gov.au/static/FullTextFiles/070596.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0JYhmsdIlVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
