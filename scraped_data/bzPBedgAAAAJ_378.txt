Health status of the lambs, as a consequence of the supplementation, was also investigated by examining their plasma metabolites. Sixty purebred and first-cross lambs were allocated to one of five treatments of lucerne hay basal diet supplemented with isocaloric and isonitrogenous wheat-based pellets without oil inclusion (Control) or graded levels of canola oil at 2.5% (2.5C), 5% (5C), flaxseed oil at 2.5% (2.5F) and 5% (5F) in a completely randomised design. Pre-slaughter blood, post-slaughter kidney, liver and heart samples were analysed for plasma metabolite and fatty acid profiles. Summations of docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, and total n-3 LC-PUFA were enhanced in the liver and kidney of 5F supplemented lambs with a marked decrease in n-6/n-3 ratio and significant breed differences detected. There were generally no deleterious impacts on animal health status. A combination of 5% oil supplementation and lamb genetics is an effective and strategic management tool for enhancing n-3 LC-PUFA contents of heart, kidney and liver without compromising lamb health."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:X4-KO54GjGYC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16779449151135873734", "cites_id": ["16779449151135873734"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/217264", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xvouBBqU3OgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
