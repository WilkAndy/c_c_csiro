The high\u2010value LC omega\u20103 oils have been conventionally sourced from fish. This paper provides a perspective on our recent study of the heterotrophic growth of thraustochytrids for their wider biotechnological potential, including as a source of a range of higher value lipids in addition to biofuels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16084679692050324387", "cites_id": ["16084679692050324387"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/lite.201300295", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o1uZqvVCON8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
