Precise monounsaturated double bond position and geometry was determined by GC-MS analysis of the derivatized fatty acids. The three species were readily distinguished based on the extractable fatty acid and LPS hydroxy acid profiles. Type I and Type II methylotrophs can be separated based on the presence of 16-carbon and 18-carbon monoenoic fatty acids in the two groups of organisms, respectively.
