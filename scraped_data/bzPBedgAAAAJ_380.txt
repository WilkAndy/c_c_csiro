These powerful techniques were used to gain new insight into microbial communities, not obtainable by classical approaches. Selected case examples are highlighted and include: use of a specific dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) derivitization procedure with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to precisely determine double bond position and geometry; application of the DMDS procedure in taxonomic and environmental studies including the degradation of pollutant halogenated hydrocarbons in groundwater and subsurface aquifers; exploiting the ubiquitous nature of uronic acids in microbial EPS to quantify these exopolymers in complex environmental samples; development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8209357997576026153", "cites_id": ["8209357997576026153"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701207002448", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KfiHj5p_7XEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
