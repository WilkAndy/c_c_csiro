Krill were collected after 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on thraustochytrids. Krill fed on thraustochytrids for 20 d were also collected after a further 5, 10 and 20 d of feeding on diatoms. An accumulation of polar lipid (0.4 mg per DG) was observed after 5 d of feeding on thraustochytrids at every concentration of food. The deposition of triacylglycerol (0.25 mg per DG) required 10 d of feeding and only occurred at the 2 highest food concentrations. Amounts of thraustochytrid-derived FA, 14: 0, 16: 0 22: 6\u03c93 and 22: 5\u03c96, increased after 10 d of feeding. The final concentration of 22: 6\u03c93 was dependent on food concentration.
