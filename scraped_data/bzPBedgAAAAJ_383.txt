Comparison of the three sites indicated that Cape Evans contained the greatest concentration of triacylglycerol (TG) (220 nmoles/gram dry weight (gdw) of sediment), approximately six to seven times that determined for sediment microorganisms from the Cape Armitage and New Harbor sites. The relative proportion of triacylglycerolderived polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) revealed a somewhat different trend. New Harbor sediment contained the greatest relative proportion of PUFA (22% of triacylglycerol fatty acids), followed by Cape Evans (16%) and Cape Armitage (11%). The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (poly-and monounsaturated) was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3332991568993527213", "cites_id": ["3332991568993527213"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287423", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rSU7TSwqQS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 4, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
