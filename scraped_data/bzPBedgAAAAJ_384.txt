Carcass fatty acid composition indicated incorporation of the dietary thraustochytrid-derived fatty acids. This was confirmed by compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) which revealed significantly 13C-depleted (\u03b413C value of \u221224\u2030) \u03c93 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c93 LC-PUFAs) in the fingerlings fed the thraustochytrid biomass containing diet, reflecting the highly 13C-depleted glycerol used to grow the thraustochytrid cultures. This finding demonstrates the bioavailability of the \u03c93 LC-PUFA of the Australian strain thraustochytrid culture (TC) 20 from the whole cell biomass that was partly cultivated on crude glycerol produced during biodiesel manufacturing. This paper demonstrates the value of Australian thraustochytrid strains grown heterotrophically for their wider biotechnological potential including as a source of higher value lipids, in particular the health-benefitting \u03c93 LC-PUFA, for use in aquaculture and other applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:GHsHDPAyICYC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12089508906165781159", "cites_id": ["12089508906165781159"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/666814", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p8LuFEyQxqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
