To identify fatty acids that may impart this Rhodococcus sp. with tolerance to toxic solvents, a benzene-sensitive strain, labeled M2b, was isolated using EMS mutagenesis. A comparative analysis of fatty acid profiles showed that strain M2b was unable to increase its saturated:unsaturated ratio of fatty acids to the level achieved by the w-t strain when both strains were challenged with benzene. This was due to M2b's increased abundance of myristic acid, and decreased abundance of oleic acid. In addition, by measuring the generalized polarization of the fluorescent membrane probe laurdan using fluorescence spectroscopy, we have shown for the first time the effects of an aromatic hydrocarbon on the membrane fluidity of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17674408511081070465", "cites_id": ["17674408511081070465"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026286700855", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gb8g1uUcSPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
