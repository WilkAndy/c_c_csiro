The respective mussel species were obtained from three different sites in both New Zealand (NZ) and Tasmania. Lipid class distribution of both mussel species was characterized by a high proportion of phospholipid (PL, 57\u201379%) and TG (10\u201325%), FFA (7\u201312%), and sterols (ST, 12\u201318%). The NZGLM had higher proportions of TG, FFA, and ST (P<0.01), whereas the TBM had a higher proportion of PL (P<0.01). There were higher proportions of total PUFA, saturated FA, n\u22123 FA, and hydroxy and nonmethyleneinterrupted FA (P<0.05) in the TBM compared with the NZGLM. The major FA in the NZGLM were 16\u22360 (15\u201317%), 20\u22365n\u20103 (14\u201320%), and 22\u22366n\u20103 (11\u201317%).
