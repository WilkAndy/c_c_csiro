In this study, the \u03c93 LC-PUFA content of raw and cooked Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle from genetically divergent Australian prime lambs supplemented with dietary degummed crude canola oil (DCCO) was evaluated.Samples of LTL muscle were sourced from 24 first cross ewe and wether lambs sired by Dorset, White Suffolk and Merino rams joined to Merino dams that were assigned to supplemental regimes of degummed crude canola oil (DCCO): a control diet at 0 mL/kg DM of DCCO (DCCOC); 25 mL/kg DM of DCCO (DCCOM) and 50 mL/kg DCCO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12440411660904683133", "cites_id": ["12440411660904683133"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40781-017-0143-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fdbZU344pawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
