Over a nine-week feeding trial, twenty-four first-cross prime lamb progeny from Merino, Dorset and White Suffolk rams mated with purebred Merino ewes under the same nutritional management were supplemented with one of three levels of wheat-based pellets with or without DCCO. The experimental treatments included the Control (1kg of plain wheat-based pellets without DCCO/head/day on dry matter basis), High (1kg of wheat-based pellets containing 50ml of DCCO/kg/head/day on dry matter basis) and Medium (500g of Control + 500g of High wheat-based pellets/head/day on dry matter basis). All lambs had a three-week adjustment period and had ad libitum access to lucerne hay and water. After nine weeks of supplementation, all experimental lambs were slaughtered at a commercial abattoir with the exception of four purebred Merino ewes retained in the flock for breeding purposes. IMF content was analysed using a 2:1 vol/vol ratio of chloroform/methanol extraction and precipitated with 10% potassium chloride. IMF content varied significantly with the level of DCCO supplementation (p<0.0125) and muscle type (p<0.0001). There were also highly significant interactions between sire breed and level of DCCO supplementation (P<0.0016), and muscle type and sex (P<0.0003) in IMF content. Prime lambs in the Control and Medium level of DCCO supplementation had the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3556266161882929910", "cites_id": ["3556266161882929910"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.utas.edu.au/17837/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9hrGeTtlWjEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
