It is likely to have contributed to the foundation of other breeds, such as the Texel, which originated in the Netherland\u2019s chain of West Friesian islands. The Texel is a meat breed that displays a muscle hypertrophy phenotype caused by a G to A substitution (g.+6723G>A) in the Myostatin gene.1 Given the likelihood of a common population history linking Texel and East Frisian, we sought to determine if the latter also carries the mutant g.+6723A Myostatin allele despite the divergent production profiles of the two breeds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1070946946283938731", "cites_id": ["1070946946283938731"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/58815/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qyOL0pLE3A4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
