However, the majority of the present catch is taken between 25 S\u201330 S, between the continental shelf and the Lord Howe Rise. It targets a range of tuna and billfish species but also a wide range of other species in the region. The rapid development of this fishery has meant that much of the research needed to adequately manage the fishery is either underway or yet to be done. There is a strong need for this research, not only to understand the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem but also to understand the highly variable spatial and temporal fluctuation in the catch (eg Campbell, 1999). Much of the understanding of these fluctuations has been derived from spatial analyses of catch effort but with less attention to oceanographic influences. More recently, efforts have been made using satellite data to relate fish catches to the surface oceanography (Campbell and Hobday, 2003). Without a greater understanding of the intermediate links in the relationship between surface physics and the top predators, however, explanations for the observed catch fluctuations are likely to be limited.The importance of the subsurface environment has not been adequately addressed, particularly in relation to the processes leading to concentrations of the larger predators. Although there is a significant body of literature on the vertical physical structure of the offshore waters of the Coral and Tasman Sea (eg Cresswell and Legeckis, 1986; Ridgway and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17949113335181755699", "cites_id": ["17949113335181755699"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jock-Young/publication/236974974_Determining_ecosystem_effects_of_longline_fishing_in_the_Eastern_Tuna_and_Billfish_Fishery/links/0deec51a9323f37edd000000/Determining-ecosystem-effects-of-longline-fishing-in-the-Eastern-Tuna-and-Billfish-Fishery.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M0W82HoPGPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
