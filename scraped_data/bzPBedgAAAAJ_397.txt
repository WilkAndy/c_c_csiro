During a 10-wk supplementary feeding trial, 60 dairy ewes balanced by live weight, milk yield, parity, and sire breed were randomly divided into 6 groups that were (1) supplemented with on-farm existing commercial wheat-based pellets without oil inclusion (control) or supplemented with wheat-based pellets infused with 50 mL/kg dry matter of oils from (2) canola, (3) rice bran, (4) flaxseed, (5) safflower, and (6) rumen-protected EPA + DHA. Milk samples from each treatment were collected separately by sire breed during the experimental period for cheese processing at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:i91s68tWr-MC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6558128041499010276", "cites_id": ["6558128041499010276"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218310208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5KQTEbUmA1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
