Sixty ewe and wether prime lambs 7 months old were randomly allocated to one of five dietary treatments: no oil inclusion (Control); 2.5% canola oil; 5% canola oil; 2.5% flaxseed oil and 5% flaxseed oil, balanced by breed (purebred Merinos (M \u00d7 M) and Corriedale \u00d7 Merino (C \u00d7 M) and White Suffolk \u00d7 Corriedale (W \u00d7 C) first crosses). Lambs were individually supplemented with 1 kg pellets per day and had free access to lucerne hay and water throughout the 7-week feeding trial, after a 3-week adaptation. Dietary oil inclusion did not cause significant differences in daily feed intake, growth performance and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11669204181417252201", "cites_id": ["11669204181417252201"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/an16812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:adXgfGBX8aEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
