The major human faecal sterol was the 5\u03b2-stanol, coprostanol which constituted \u2248 60% of the total sterols found in human faeces. The sterol profiles of herbivores were dominated by C29 sterols and 5\u03b2-stanols were generally in equal or greater abundance than 5\u03b1-stanols. The principal faecal biomarker of herbivores was 24-ethylcoprostanol. The sterol content of bird faeces was extremely variable and largely dependent on the animals diet. Both 5\u03b2 and 5\u03b1 stanols were in very low abundance in birds and dogs faeces from this study presumably due to the absence or low activity of the necessary anaerobic biota required to reduce \u03945- or \u03945,22-sterols to stanols. Cats and pigs were the only animals that had similar faecal sterol profiles to humans. However, the concentration of the principal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 592, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12387928155515645503", "cites_id": ["12387928155515645503"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135496000115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P-6R_AXD6qsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 9, "1999": 10, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 14, "2003": 15, "2004": 19, "2005": 25, "2006": 25, "2007": 27, "2008": 30, "2009": 20, "2010": 21, "2011": 25, "2012": 33, "2013": 22, "2014": 35, "2015": 27, "2016": 38, "2017": 29, "2018": 37, "2019": 25, "2020": 28, "2021": 20, "2022": 25, "2023": 14}}
