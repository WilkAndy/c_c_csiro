Echium seed oil has a combination of specific n-3 and n-6 PUFAs that are involved in inflammatory processes in the body. In addition to the well-recognized benefits against CVD, conditions and diseases where the evidences of n-3 PUFAs are considered to be greater are asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The oil has two main distinguishing features from other vegetable oils: (1) it is naturally rich in SDA, and (2) its n-6 fatty acid content includes \u03b3-linolenic acid (GLA), which is thought to lead to production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. Animal experiments and direct human supplementation studies show that echium seed oil can bring about beneficial changes in biomarkers of chronic diseases, such as lowering triacylglycerol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hHIA4WEVY-EC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18390953175726685351", "cites_id": ["18390953175726685351"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123756886101124", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p_wHUHnKOf8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
