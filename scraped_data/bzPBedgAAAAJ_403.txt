Diacylglyceryl ether (DAGE) was 0.7% of total lipids in the gonad. The major alkyl constituents of the glyceryl ether diols in the gonad (as % of total diols) were 16\u22360 (38%) and 18\u22361 (36%). While levels of DAGE in the abalone foot were below flameionization detection limits, glyceryl ether diols from them were detected using the more sensitive GC-MS procedure. The major diol components in the foot were 18\u22360 (39%) and 18\u22361 (32%). To our knowledge, this is the first report of DAGE in abalone tissues. Although the precise role of DAGE in abalone remains to be determined, a possible structural role may exist."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17456976785924277131", "cites_id": ["17456976785924277131"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11745-999-0381-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i8NBUeWjQ_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
