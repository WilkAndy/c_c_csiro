However, questions have been raised about using fatty acids as dietary indicators from whole lipid samples, rather than from separate lipid classes. A drawback of scientific field-based studies is that samples are rarely collected over extended periods, precluding seasonal dietary comparisons. We used fisheries samples obtained over one year to investigate seasonal variations in the fatty acid composition of separated phospholipids and triacylglycerols of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Seasonal variation was observed in fatty acid biomarkers within triacylglycerol and phospholipid fractions of krill. Fatty acids in krill triacylglycerols (thought to best represent recent diet), reflected omnivorous feeding with highest percentages of flagellate biomarkers (18:4n-3) in summer, and diatom biomarkers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:cF7EPgIk0B4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10737269994058667784", "cites_id": ["10737269994058667784"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-019-02573-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CNdTzStyApUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
