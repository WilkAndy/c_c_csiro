Under the culture conditions and feeding regirne used, striped trumpeter raised for periods between two to four years contained mediun (2-5%, wet weight) to very high (> 10%) levels of oil, higher than for wild specimens (1%). Cultured fish contained moderate to very high levels of the beneficial omega-3 long-chain (= C) polyunsaturated fatty acids, highest amounts of which, reaching i 0 200 mg 100 g, were found in one large, mature cultured fish that had not spawned. They are, to our knowledge, the highest concentrations yet recorded globally for any finfish under culture. Further research and development, including a range of culturing trials where diet and other key factors are examined, should be pursued to enhance the oil profile of this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6777024002052207914", "cites_id": ["6777024002052207914"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Nichols-2/publication/283156740_Potential_new_Australian_farmed_seafood_source_of_omega-3_oils_Oil_and_fatty_acid_composition_of_the_finfish_striped_trumpeter_Latris_lineata/links/56305b8e08ae432a022c3d84/Potential-new-Australian-farmed-seafood-source-of-omega-3-oils-Oil-and-fatty-acid-composition-of-the-finfish-striped-trumpeter-Latris-lineata.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KjWedGzTDF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
