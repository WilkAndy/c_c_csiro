Australia has one of the largest exclusive economic zones (EEZ) globally, an area known to be rich in marine biodiversity from polar, temperate and tropical waters. It has been acknowledged for some time that although Australia is surrounded by a rich marine resource, we are not taking advantage of the potential benefits from the abundant biodiversity. Future research efforts will address this shortcoming. An overview on aspects of current Australian research and development in marine biotechnology, focusing on marine omega-3 oils, will be presented. A comprehensive data-base has been established on the nutritional composition (oils emphasis) of principal Australian seafood. Results are available for strategic marketing of Australian fish species as well as for use by medical and consumer groups. Most Australian fish contain high levels of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=657239588543960809", "cites_id": ["657239588543960809"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167450104800141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6ZZ8b-z7HgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
