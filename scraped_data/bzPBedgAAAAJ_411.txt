It is hypothesized that including these oils in the diet of grazing dairy ewes will improve milk fatty acid (FA) composition by increasing levels of n\u22123 LC\u2010PUFA. Sixty grazing dairy ewes balanced by sire breed and parity are randomly allocated to one of 6 treatments: 1) Control: commercial pellets without oil inclusion; 2) pellets containing 50\u2009mL\u2009kg\u22121 DM of CO; 3) RBO; 4) FSO; 5) SFO; and 6) RPO at the rate of 1\u2009kg\u2009day\u22121 for each ewe for 8 weeks.
