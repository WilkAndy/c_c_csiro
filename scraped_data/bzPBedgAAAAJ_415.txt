These membrane components were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of diether to tetraether lipids was 1:14 on a weight basis and represents the highest proportion of tetraether yet reported in a methanogenic bacterium. This data and the application of this method has relevance in microbial ecology and organic geochemistry where these chemical signatures may be used to assess the contributions of methane-forming bacteria to biological processes in natural environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3288119161401706174", "cites_id": ["3288119161401706174"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/35/2-3/115/575620", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vgaBwvS-oS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
