These fatty acids are predominantly sourced from fish and algal oils, but it is widely recognised that there is an urgent need for an alternative and sustainable source of EPA and DHA. Since the earliest demonstrations of \u03c93 LC-PUFA engineering there has been good progress in engineering the C20 EPA with seed fatty acid levels similar to that observed in bulk fish oil (\u223c18%), although undesirable \u03c96 PUFA levels have also remained high.The transgenic seed production of the particularly important C22 DHA has been problematic with many attempts resulting in the accumulation of EPA/DPA, but only a few percent of DHA. This study describes the production of up to 15% of the C22 fatty acid DHA in Arabidopsis thaliana seed oil with a high \u03c93/\u03c96 ratio. This was achieved using a transgenic pathway to increase the C18 ALA which was then converted to DHA by a microalgal \u03946-desaturase pathway.The amount of DHA described in this study exceeds the 12% level at which DHA is generally found in bulk fish oil. This is a breakthrough in the development of sustainable alternative sources of DHA as this technology should be applicable in oilseed crops. One hectare of a Brassica napus crop containing 12% DHA in seed oil would produce as much \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12232313395739510566", "cites_id": ["12232313395739510566"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JkdOTjnowakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 20, "2015": 19, "2016": 20, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 14, "2020": 24, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 8}}
