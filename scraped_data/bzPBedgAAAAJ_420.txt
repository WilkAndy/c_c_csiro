Management regulations do not currently discriminate in the protection afforded to the broodstock in the different regions. This study has examined whether regional and size differences in early egg diameter, phyllosoma length at hatch and phyllosoma competency, are related to lipid class and fatty acid composition, protein composition and water content in late stage eggs and early stage phyllosoma larvae. A positive relationship, particularly to phyllosoma competency, would have management implications for the protection of broodstock in different parts of the fishery. Females were sampled in three size groups captured in two sampling regions (Abrolhos Islands 60-70 and ; coastal 80-90 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7312152893983450679", "cites_id": ["7312152893983450679"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcb/article-abstract/27/3/445/2548171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N2Y6zVD8eWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
