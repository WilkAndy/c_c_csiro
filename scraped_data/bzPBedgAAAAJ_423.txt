The nearshore currents and the austral summer photoperiod have recently been determined to exert substantial influence (at least on a seasonal scale) on sediment microorganisms and perhaps indirect influence on macrofaunal communities (Dayton and Oliver, 1977; White et al., 1985; Dayton et al., 1986; Smith et al., 1986a, 1989a). The viable biomass of microorganisms in sediments of Antarctic nearshore regions are of magnitude similar to that in more temperate and tropical environments (White,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1517011870480611742", "cites_id": ["1517011870480611742"], "pub_url": "https://davidcwhite.org/fulltext/337.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:njkMPEKCDRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
