More than 1 year was required to achieve habituation to the most inhibitory component of the SX reagent, 4-nonylphenol (4-NP; 2mgL\u22121), when S. thermosulfidooxidans was grown in ferrous ion medium. However, habituation to 4-NP did not confer the ability to tolerate higher 4-NP concentrations and those characteristics acquired by the cells during habituation were rapidly lost when grown for a short period in 4-NP-free medium. The culture habituated to the presence of 2mgL\u22121 4-NP exhibited differences in cell morphology, cell ultrastructure and membrane fatty acid composition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8006587293176887002", "cites_id": ["8006587293176887002"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511310002904", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2vb28LgcHW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
