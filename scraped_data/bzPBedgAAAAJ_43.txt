The major lipids in all species of shark were diacylglyceryl ethers and triacylglycerols, and the major hydrocarbon was squalene. Only trace levels of polar lipids were detected. Monounsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1, C20:1, C22:1 and C24:1) comprised 62\u201384% of the fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids contributed 11\u201326% of the total fatty acids, while polyunsaturated fatty acids were relatively minor components (1\u201313%). All sharks had different lipid compositions, but similar fatty acid and diol profiles. The high squalene content (50\u201382% of oil) of all species, except Centroscymnus plunketi and Somniosus pacificus suggests that the oil from these deep-sea \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7191625458246726822", "cites_id": ["7191625458246726822"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305049194000837", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:prRzXEDJzWMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 11, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
