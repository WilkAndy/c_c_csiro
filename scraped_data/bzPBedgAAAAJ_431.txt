When his marriage ended, Nichols had to sell the only thing he and his wife owned-their boat. With only his sextant, his instincts as a seasoned sailor and his memories of a floundering marriage, he sets out from England to sail to America to sell his beloved boat, Toad. Halfway across the Atlantic, Toad springs a leak. As the sea floods in faster, Nichols tries everything to stay afloat, desperately pumping the water out by hand. He loses the battle after three days and is forced to abandon Toad. This is more than a sea-tale. It is the painful story of his marriage, his boat and himself."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7690215905029797410", "cites_id": ["7690215905029797410"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WMdlDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=info:IjZcAZ8iuWoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qTzWPq0hBL&sig=N91vdecvJD5i_UCJ9l3AiTRCYxs", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IjZcAZ8iuWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
