Proteomic analysis of whole fish larvae comprising multiple tissues offers considerable potential but is challenging due to the very large dynamic range of protein abundance. To extend the coverage of the larval phase of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) proteome, we applied a two\u2010step sequential extraction (SE) method, based on differential protein solubility, using a nondenaturing buffer containing 150 mM NaCl followed by a denaturing buffer containing 7 M urea and 2 M thiourea. Extracts prepared using SE and one\u2010step direct extraction were characterized via label\u2010free shotgun proteomics using nanoLC\u2010MS/MS (LTQ\u2010Orbitrap). SE partitioned the proteins into two fractions of approximately equal amounts, but with very distinct protein composition, leading to identification of \u223c40 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11329086491021034612", "cites_id": ["11329086491021034612"], "pub_url": "https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pmic.201600051", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dET8tiMAOZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
