Since members of the genus Arenibacter have not been previously shown to degrade hydrocarbons, we attempted to isolate a representative strain of this genus in order to directly investigate its hydrocarbon-degrading potential. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, one isolate (designated strain TG409T) exhibited >99% sequence identity to three type strains of this genus. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain TG409T represents a novel species in the genus Arenibacter, for which the name Arenibacter algicola sp. nov. is proposed. We reveal for the first time that PAH-degradation is a shared phenotype among members of this genus, indicating that it could be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=661288457829442122", "cites_id": ["661288457829442122"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=661288457829442122&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SmL9RlleLQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
