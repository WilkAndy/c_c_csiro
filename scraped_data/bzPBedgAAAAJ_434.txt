The Collection is incorpoarted within the CSIRO Microalgal Research Centre (CMARC) which provides a supply service of microalgal strains to industry, government and university organizations. Research within CMARC and in partnership with collaborators spans a wide base within the three themes of Environment, Aquaculture and Biotechnology. Some of the research projects undertaken include physiological studies of different life-history stages of microalgae, toxin production in harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, phylogenetic studies of different populations of HAB species, optimizing the nutritional benefit of microalgal diets in larval and broodstock aquaculture species, including important nutrients such as vitamins and polyunstaurated fatty acids. Research is also being undertaken into optimizing high biomass production systems through the use of photobioreactors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13337689973667226066", "cites_id": ["13337689973667226066"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/blackburnsi_x2002.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0mG5bF3-GLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
