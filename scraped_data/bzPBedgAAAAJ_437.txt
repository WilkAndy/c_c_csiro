Our purpose in the 1985-1986 field season was to examine changes in photosynthetic metabolism that occur during the development and decline of the spring bloom of sea-ice microalgae. We have proposed that sea-ice microalgae may serve as a model system for studying growth phase-related changes in physiology of natural populations of microalgae. Because they are physically trapped within the brine channels and pockets that permeate sea ice, a single community may be repetitively sampled throughout the bloom period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18323089631010562480", "cites_id": ["18323089631010562480"], "pub_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/Antarctica/AJUS/AJUSvXXIn5/AJUSvXXIn5p176.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sCEHhPCwSP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1}}
