The contents of 54 stomachs (50 from squid collected near Macquarie Island and 4 from squid collected near Heard Island) were examined visually, and prey remains were identified to species level where possible. Myctophid fish were the most common prey item in the stomach contents of M. ingens and were identified in 59% of stomachs. In total, teleost fish remains were found in 96% of stomachs. The lipid class and fatty acid profiles of the digestive gland and mantle tissue were analysed for 5 to 6 squid from each area, in addition to 4 stomach fluid samples taken from Heard Island animals. Mantle tissue was low in lipid, and contained high concentrations of phospholipids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Digestive gland tissue had a high lipid content, with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15675423799650516249", "cites_id": ["15675423799650516249"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v215/p179-189/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GX3f0eRKitkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 11, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 14, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
