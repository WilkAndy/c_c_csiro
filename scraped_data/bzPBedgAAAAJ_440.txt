The results demonstrated that live animal performance and carcass characteristics of prime lambs on a lucerne basal diet were improved after the supplementation with oil based polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched pellets. Supplementation of lambs with rice bran oil and canola oil resulted in improved live animal performance and carcass characteristics of prime lambs at comparatively lower feed costs than oils from flaxseed, safflower and rumen-protected sources. These results are very useful for prime lamb producers in increasing product quality and farm profitability without compromising animal performance and well-being.This study investigated live animal performance and carcass characteristics of Australian prime lambs fed oil based polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) enriched pellets in a feedlot system. The tested hypothesis was that supplementation of lambs with a variety of dietary oil based PUFA enriched pellets would enhance growth and carcass characteristics compared with the control lambs fed only with lucerne hay. Seventy-two, 6 months old White Suffolk x Corriedale first-cross prime lambs with an average liveweight (LWT) of 35.7 \u00b1 0.9 kg were allocated to six treatment groups in a completely randomised experimental design. The treatments were: (1) control: lucerne hay only; or lucerne hay plus wheat-based pellets infused with 50 mL/kg dry matter (DM) of oils from (2) rice bran (RBO); (3) canola (CO); (4) rumen protected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5LPo_wSKItgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13586357479729195858", "cites_id": ["13586357479729195858"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/376026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Uuu66iRwjLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
