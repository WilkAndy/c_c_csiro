Thirty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in Longissimus dorsi muscle samples from 362 crossbred prime lambs sired by five genetically divergent rams. Total intramuscular lipid long chain fatty acid levels were analysed using gas chromatography. Genetic association was tested for significance using mixed model analyses in SAS fitting genotype, sire breed and sex as fixed effects and sire as a random variable. FAPB SNP was highly significantly associated (P<0.05) with 18:4n-3 (stearidonic acid), while FADS2 SNP was significantly associated (P<0.05) with intramuscular levels of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The results suggest that this SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with functional lipid synthesis pathway associated with higher delta-six desaturase activity. For the first time, this study provides evidence for an association between genetic variants of FADS2 and omega-3 PUFA in sheep muscle. This SNP could potentially be a novel marker of choice for prime lamb producers to effectively select for enhanced muscle omega-3 fatty acid content in their breeding flock."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6839294086823399355", "cites_id": ["6839294086823399355"], "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/55050/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u8-JX7wN6l4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
