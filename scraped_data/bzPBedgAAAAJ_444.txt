Wild-caught seafood is promoted as an ideal source of the two important long-chain omega-3 PUFA\u2013EPA [eicosapentaenoic acid, 20: 5 (n-3)] and DHA [docosahexaenoic acid, 22: 6 (n-3)]. The human body manufactures only small amounts of these PUFA, so we need them from our diet. Two volumes of the FRDC-funded Guide \u201cSeafood the Good Food\u201d have been produced and detail the oil and PUFA composition of Australian seafood, with species examined largely from the wild. Omega-3 PUFA oils are also a prerequisite for survival and development of many marine finfishes, molluscs and crustaceans. The Guides also provide an indication to PUFA levels required in farmed species if their marketing for human \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3592839428881907669", "cites_id": ["3592839428881907669"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3592839428881907669&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1f-FxWxU3DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
