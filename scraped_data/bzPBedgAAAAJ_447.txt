Progress on the characterization of such oils and the manufacture of value-added products is reported. Value-added marine oil products can be manufactured from both the by-catch of established fisheries and from waste generated from seafood processing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2649698089645370255", "cites_id": ["2649698089645370255"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9303419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j-tXs1-exSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
