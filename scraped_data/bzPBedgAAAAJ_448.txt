The origin and treatment of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to get the rumen protected EPA + DHA treatment was based on a modification of the microencapsulation of oil droplets in a protein-aldehyde matrix procedure. The results demonstrated that supplementation with rumen (EPA + DHA) and oil-infused pellets improved milk, fat, and protein yields by approximately 30%, 13%, and 31% respectively, and crossbred ewes produced more milk than purebreds. These results are very useful for dairy sheep producers in improving ewe lactation performance, milk quality, and body condition score under low quality pasture grazing conditions.The Australian dairy sheep industry is small and mostly based on a natural grass grazing system, which can limit productivity. The current study tested different plant oil-infused and rumen protected polyunsaturated fats and their interactions with sire breeds to improve lactation traits and body condition scores (BCS) of ewes grazing low quality pastures. It was hypothesised that supplementing lactating ewe\u2019s diets with plant-derived polyunsaturated oils would improve milk production and composition without compromising BCS. Sixty ewes (n = 10/treatment) in mid-lactation, balanced by sire breed, parity, milk yield, body condition score, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:LWqeokA2EBkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15715441935655773458", "cites_id": ["15715441935655773458"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/383262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EiUKLy13GNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
