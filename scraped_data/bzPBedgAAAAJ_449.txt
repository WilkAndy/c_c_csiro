The novel \u03c93 PUFA were identified as 18:3(9c,12c,15t) (0.2\u20131.8 % of total fatty acids), 18:4(6c,9c,12c,15t) (1.9\u20134.1 %), 18:5 (3c,6c,9c,12c,15t) (0.7\u20138.8 %), 20:5(5c,8c,11c,14c,17t) (1.2\u20134.1 %) and 22:6(4c,7c,10c,13c,16c,19t) (0.3\u20134.3 %), and were accompanied by larger proportions of the all cis isomers: 18:3\u03c93(9,12,15) (2.7\u20133.5 %), 18:4\u03c93(6,9,12,15) (9.3\u201314.3 %), 18:5\u03c93(3,6,9,12,15) (7.8\u201318.5 %), 20:5\u03c93(5,8,11,14,17) (3.2\u20133.9 %), 22:5\u03c93(7,10,13,16,19) (0.1\u20130.3 %) and 22:6\u03c93(4,7,10,13,16,19) (2.3\u20135.2 %). GC analysis of FAME using a non-polar column did not reveal the trans isomers as they coeluted with the all cis PUFA.
