Exposure of aerated soils to methane resulted in the formation of a high proportion of an unusual 18-carbon mono-unsaturated PLFA, 18:lw8c. High proportions of this fatty acid biomarker are found in monocultures from this soil grown in minimal media with methane. This PLFA has been previously established as associated with authentic type II methane-oxidizing bacteria. The microbiota in aerated soils exposed to hydrocarbons containing propane, formed a suite of PLFA characterized by high proportions of a 16-carbon mono-unsaturated acid, 16:lw6c, and an 18-carbon saturated fatty acid with an additional methyl branch at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7630124385405609751", "cites_id": ["7630124385405609751"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/5/1/39/515464", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F6cl0LOl42kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 4, "1992": 6, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 5, "1996": 5, "1997": 10, "1998": 7, "1999": 10, "2000": 6, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 8, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
