Omega-3 LC-PUFA also have beneficial effects against some cancers as well as various mental disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD and Alzheimer's disease. Presently fish oils are the main commercial source of the beneficial omega-3 LC-PUFA. However, global fish stocks have been reported to be unsustainable, indicating a need for new sustainable and commercially viable sources of such oils. In addition, fish do not synthesise these oils, rather microalgae and other marine microorganisms (eg thraustochytrids and some bacteria) are the primary source of omega-3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17569358050062321388", "cites_id": ["17569358050062321388"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601639&h=WbHRP0Gx1BFaqLtZ5em9pWRnIYH6rdB6Bncy%2FQc0HDonK%2BMyJ8gzVDpuyiyXB1q%2FIVwZ%2Bj5wNrlR7GyQGkeoyg%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7EadYQ_m0vMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
