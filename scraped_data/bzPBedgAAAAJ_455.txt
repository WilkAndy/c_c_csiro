Signature fatty acid (FA) and lipid class analysis was carried out on the digestive gland, fins and caecum oil of 18 individuals of I. cordiformis caught in the waters off southern Australia during late 2004. Lipid classes varied between the tissues and oil samples, with sex not being an important factor. The presence of hydrocarbons within the digestive gland and caecum was noteworthy, as high proportions of this lipid class are generally only common in the livers of many deepwater sharks. Monounsaturated FAs dominated the digestive gland and caecum oil, while the fin had high values of both saturated and polyunsaturated FAs. FA profiles of I. cordiformis were compared to profiles of potential prey species (sharks, small and large fish, crustaceans and squid) using Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients.
