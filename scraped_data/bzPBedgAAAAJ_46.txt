This review aims to provide an enhanced understanding of these protists with a particular emphasis on their taxonomy, ecology and biotechnology applications. Over the years, thraustochytrid taxonomy has improved with the development of modern molecular techniques and new biochemical markers, resulting in the isolation and description of new strains. In the present work, the taxonomic history of thraustochytrids is reviewed, while providing an up-to-date classification of these organisms. It also describes the various biomarkers that may be taken into consideration to support taxonomic characterization of the thraustochytrids, together with a review of traditional and modern techniques for their isolation and molecular identification. The originality of this review lies in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC", "num_citations": 143, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9829529209233404176", "cites_id": ["9829529209233404176"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975017301143", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EPGumbyAaYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 19, "2020": 26, "2021": 36, "2022": 42, "2023": 15}}
