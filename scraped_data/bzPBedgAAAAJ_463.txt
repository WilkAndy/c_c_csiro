Management of this problem depends on identifying the source of faecal matter. A detailed investigation is underway into the feasibility of utilizing faecal sterols as biomarkers for tracing faecal pollution, with high resolution capillary gas chromatography providing 'fingerprints' of animal faeces."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18335335427487839079", "cites_id": ["18335335427487839079"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9401284", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZzMMMW0ydP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
