The DRIFT spectra of pure maceral isolates established the aliphatic content to be in the order of exinite >> vitrinite > inertinite. The difference spectra of the maceral lithotypes fusain and vitrain show the ready loss of aliphatic groups in the former as an early oxidation step. Oxygen uptake by vitrain is initially slow compared with ROM and fusain coals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15140014626476747528", "cites_id": ["15140014626476747528"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6207588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CGtdaRYjHNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
