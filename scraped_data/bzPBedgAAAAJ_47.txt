From the quantitative comparisons which can be drawn, relative changes in the lipid classes occurring during leaf decay can be highlighted. These base-line data are important to our understanding of inputs to marine intertidal sediments. During leaf decay the only significant changes were a reduction in the total absolute concentrations of monobasic acids due largely to a decrease in concentration of the C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an enhancement of the concentrations of the long-chain monobasic acids, \u03c9-hydroxy acids and \u03b1,\u03c9-dibasic acids. This resistance to degradation shown by the cutin derived acids (\u03b1,\u03c9-dibasic, \u03c9-hydroxy and long-chain monobasic acids) relative to the cellular and wax \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18213475582924202727", "cites_id": ["18213475582924202727"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031942281851527", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:56JyJYtDw_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 7, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 9, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
