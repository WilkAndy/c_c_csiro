Evidence from anecdotal observations of feeding events and stomach content analysis have identified a wide range of planktonic and nektonic organisms including copepods, krill and small fish as whale shark prey. However, recent studies based on biochemical analysis (eg signature fatty acids (FA)) indicated that whale sharks in the western Indian Ocean had a wider foraging range than previous studies suggested, with important contributions from meso-and bathypelagic sources. However, it remains unknown if these results characterize the diet of whale sharks over the wider Indian Ocean. Here, we investigate the feeding ecology of whale sharks in the eastern Indian Ocean at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, by identifying differences in whale shark \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2574293389035362297", "cites_id": ["2574293389035362297"], "pub_url": "https://www.qscience.com/content/papers/10.5339/qproc.2016.iwsc4.69", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-dcWuTK6uSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2}}
