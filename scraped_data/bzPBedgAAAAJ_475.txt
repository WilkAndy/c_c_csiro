Consequently, understanding the detailed relationships between feed formulation, nutritional physiology and critical environmental parameters, including elevated water temperatures, is essential for farm management. Our on-going research program (Carter et al., 2005) has focused on understanding the influence of elevated temperatures of 18-21\u00b0C on protein and energy utilization, protein metabolism and ingredient characteristics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=720210785623513632", "cites_id": ["720210785623513632"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/53432/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IJp-yOSz_gkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
