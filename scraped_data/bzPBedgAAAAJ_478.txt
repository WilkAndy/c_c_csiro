Vegetables oils, such as canola, linseed and sunflower, have been extensively investigated as alternate sources and it has been shown that they do not affect fish health or growth. However, these vegetable oils do not provide omega 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c93 LC-PUFA), which provide the cardiovascular protective and other beneficial properties that are associated with eating salmon containing these \u03c9 LC-PUFA. Objective--To determine the effect of novel lipid diets on health, growth and biochemistry of Atlantic salmon and how the fish use and store these lipids, including their regiospecific distribution. Design--Two novel diets consisting of oil from:(i) a plant source Echium plantagineum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14930555978548160077,12585686420789883318", "cites_id": ["14930555978548160077", "12585686420789883318"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601773&h=SW%2FYFyVMp151oQtkStLXC6GSVVcqf0um2ghsel9PGxzahzFJbU5t04JL2P4bdNgShWRo4I78oKd7So2RIVY%2BSQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TaZymI79M88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
