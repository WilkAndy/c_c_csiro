LC omega-3 oils are also obtained in lower amounts per serve from red meat, egg and selected other foods. As global population increases the opportunities to increase seafood harvest are limited, therefore new alternate sources are required. Emerging sources include microalgae and under-utilized resources such as Southern Ocean krill. Prospects for new land plant sources of these unique and health-benefiting oils are also particularly promising, offering hope for alternate and sustainable supplies of these key oils, with resulting health, social, economic and environmental benefits."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6428754829995870571", "cites_id": ["6428754829995870571"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/2/6/572", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:awn79XSGN1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 20, "2015": 14, "2016": 11, "2017": 12, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 14, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
