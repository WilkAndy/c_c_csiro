Total lipid (TL) content varied widely across the blubber layers of adults (27\u201377%). Overall, females had higher TL content than males possibly representing higher energy needs due to reproduction. Higher TL content in the middle layer of adults (69%) suggests this layer may act as an energy reserve. Wax esters (WE) dominated the blubber and were highest in the outer layer of adults and calves, likely providing insulative qualities for this deep-diving odontocete. Triacyclglycerols, an easily mobilized energy source, were highest in the inner layer of females (37.3\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5%) and calves (32.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8%) compared to males (17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2%).
