Knowledge of krill diet within different regions will help predict how environmental change may impact local krill populations. Krill from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean were compared. The total lipid, lipid class, neutral lipid fraction fatty acid and sterol content and composition of whole krill, their digestive glands, and stomachs during the late-summer were examined. Indian sector krill had a distinctly different dietary lipid pattern to Atlantic and Pacific sector krill based on their fatty acid profiles (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Indian sector whole krill had higher phospholipids (55.0\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9%, % total lipids) compared to Pacific (45.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6%) and Atlantic sector whole krill (43.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2%) but showed lower phospholipid levels in their digestive glands (29.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5%, 52.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7%, 52.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9%, respectively).
