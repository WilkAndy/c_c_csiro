Scats were collected and analyzed for remaining prey hard parts in each of the 3 years, and in 1999 and 2000, the fatty acid (FA) composition of fur seal milk samples was also examined for longer-term dietary preferences. Scat analyses revealed that seals foraged primarily on fish and some squid in all 3 years with 25 species of fish being taken during the study. Myctophid fish accounted for an average of 94% by number of all fish consumed with 3 species, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, G. piabilis and Electrona subaspera, forming the core diet. Inter-annual differences in dietary species composition were apparent, however, with the presence of the mackerel icefish Champsocephalus gunnari in 1998 and the myctophid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10113836245284738488", "cites_id": ["10113836245284738488"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v245/p281-297/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uNWqzHqQW4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 8, "2005": 6, "2006": 18, "2007": 13, "2008": 9, "2009": 4, "2010": 10, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 11, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
