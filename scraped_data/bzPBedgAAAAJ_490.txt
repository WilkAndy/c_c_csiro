The rapid increase in global aquaculture production and the resultant anticipated shortfall in fish oil supply have generated much research in evaluating alternatives to dietary fish oil. Previous research by the first author has shown that crude palm oil (CPO) can be successfully incorporated into salmonid diets without affecting growth performance. Nevertheless, the high content of saturated fatty acids (SFA)(about 50%) in CPO has been shown to be a significant factor affecting fatty acid digestibility and subsequent energy availability when used in aquafeeds. The reduction in the apparent digestibility (AD) of saturates is due in part to the increasing resistance of triacylglycerols (TAG) to digestion with increasing CPO content in rainbow trout diets. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of using palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), which contains more than 90% of its fatty acids in free form (FFA), on fatty acid digestibility in rainbow trout raised at two different water temperatures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:uPCvBZYD9qUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2669234555905534382", "cites_id": ["2669234555905534382"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2669234555905534382&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rmnytq8GCyUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
