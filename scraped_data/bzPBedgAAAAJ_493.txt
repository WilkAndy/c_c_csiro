Due to a decline in global and national fisheries, alternate sources of these beneficial healthenhancing oils are needed. Australian single cell organisms, both phototrophic microalgae and heterotrophic thraustochytrids, have been isolated and examined for their LC-PUFA profiles, and will be explored as potential commercial sources of LCPUFA for a range of applications. In the longer term, the project also aims to transfer the genes from such marine microorganisms into important oil seed and crop plants to enable them to produce omega-3 LC-PUFA oils.The health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids are extremely diverse and increasingly being recognized. Nutritional studies continue to demonstrate important benefits from consumption of the omega-3 containing oils. The two main omega-3 long-chain (\u2265 C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) present in fish oil-20: 5\u03c93, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 22: 6\u03c93, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-are beneficial against various human disorders. It is now well accepted that these fish-derived PUFA decrease the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). From this evidence, eating fish two or three times per week results in measurable benefits with respect to parameters examined in CHD studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11811253385899069791", "cites_id": ["11811253385899069791"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Nichols-2/publication/294703994_New_Australian_single_cell_and_crop_plant_sources_of_health-enhancing_long-chain_omega-3_oils/links/56e7348c08ae85e780cfe230/New-Australian-single-cell-and-crop-plant-sources-of-health-enhancing-long-chain-omega-3-oils.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X9GkMmAA6qMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
