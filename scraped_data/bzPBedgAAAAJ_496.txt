Innovative techniques are required to enumerate and characterise microbial communities as a prerequisite to determining river health. The use of microbial lipids enables biomass, community structure and nutritional status to be determined; in many cases the application of microbial lipid procedures will provide information not available using classical methods (eg. plate and direct microscopic counts). Components common to all cells provide a measure of total microbial biomass. Compounds restricted in distribution to subsets of the microbiota can be used as signatures for these groups, providing understanding of community structure, while nutritional status can be determined by measuring storage products or components that may change in concentration during environmental stress. During the past 20 years, microbial lipids (termed \u2018signature lipids\u2019) have been used increasingly by microbial ecologists in a wide range of environments. The application of microbial lipid assays provides powerful and sensitive tools to complement other procedures available for monitoring river health."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12325555454125136146", "cites_id": ["12325555454125136146"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=71df596119ebb4bacfa3636420699622179eb9b9#page=27", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EtmBxmErDasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1}}
