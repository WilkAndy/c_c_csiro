Measured trace metal concentrations have been compared with data obtained in a survey in 1975. Organic contaminants, such as hydrocarbons or resin acids, or the faecal biomarker coprostanol have little or no data for a similar comparison. Long-term monitoring is advocated as being essential to evaluating measures to improve the estuarine environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=525148637678924823", "cites_id": ["525148637678924823"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.364441692052299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F_QhU-ezSQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
