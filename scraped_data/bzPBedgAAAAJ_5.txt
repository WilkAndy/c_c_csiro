Two procedures were used: the extraction of lipids from biomass followed by transesterification of the fatty acids (extraction-transesterification); and the direct transesterification of biomass to produce fatty acid methyl esters (i.e. without the initial extraction step). Variable factors in the extraction-transesterification experiment were the sequence in which solvents were added to the samples, the relative amount of methanol in the solvent mix, and sonication of biomass while in the solvent mix. Variable factors in the direct transesterification experiment were sample size, and reaction duration. Statistical analysis of data (level of significance P<0.05) showed that: (1) extraction of total fatty acids prior to transesterification was significantly more efficient when solvents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 512, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13562457091925601867", "cites_id": ["13562457091925601867"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701200002177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S-6zPd6GN7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 14, "2010": 23, "2011": 28, "2012": 36, "2013": 52, "2014": 42, "2015": 37, "2016": 42, "2017": 34, "2018": 34, "2019": 32, "2020": 41, "2021": 21, "2022": 21, "2023": 12}}
