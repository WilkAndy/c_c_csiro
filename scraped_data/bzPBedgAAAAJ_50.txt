Polar lipid (PL) was the major lipid class in all amphipods (58\u201388% of total lipid), except for T. gaudichaudi in which triacylglycerol (TAG) was dominant (62%). Cholesterol was the major sterol in the gammarid amphipods (89\u201391% of total sterols), and the hyperiid P. macropa (70%). The hyperiids T. gaudichaudi and H. macrocephalus had a more diverse sterol composition including trans-dehydrocholesterol, desmosterol, 24-nordehydrocholesterol, 24-methylcholest-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, 24-methylenecholesterol, and stanols (mostly cholestanol).
