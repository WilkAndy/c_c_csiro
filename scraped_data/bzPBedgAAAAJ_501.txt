To obtain a broad understanding of marine lipid dynamics, we used information from more than 470 species of Australian and Southern Ocean marine consumers spanning across the food web, from secondary to apex predators, sampled over a 30 yr period (1989 to 2019). Taxa group, trophic guild, and collection period were found to be the most influential drivers of variability in 4 key variables (TLC, docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, 22: 6n-3], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20: 5n-3] and arachidonic acid [ARA, 20: 4n-6]). Highest TLC was observed in marine mammals and mid-trophic consumers, highest DHA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ovGv7akYl-cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v710/p1-14/", "cites_per_year": {}}
