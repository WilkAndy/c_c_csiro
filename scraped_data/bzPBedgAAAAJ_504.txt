Deep-water dogfish utilise a large oil-rich liver for buoyancy, which may account for 20\u201325% of their body weight. An important constituent of certain dogfish liver oil is squalene, a highly unsaturated triterpenoid (C30H50) hydrocarbon which in some species can be up to 90% of the oil, though in the Australian commercial species it is typically around 50%. Squalene (and deep-water dogfish liver oil in general) has a long-standing high value in products, such as cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Manufacturers are increasingly required to demonstrate the sustainability of products, and this is integral to the importance of demonstrating product provenance. Australia\u2019s mid-slope deep-water dogfish fishery is recognised globally as well managed and sustainable; therefore, it is important to be able to distinguish products derived from these regions from other unregulated, unsustainable and cheaper sources in order to protect Australia\u2019s competitive advantages and ensure sustainability. In this study, we have sourced deep-water dogfish liver oil samples originating from Southeast Australia, New Zealand, India, Northeast Africa and the Arabian Sea. The squalene was isolated by commercial or laboratory processing. A compound-specific carbon stable isotope analysis of the derived squalene was then used to determine isotopic resolution and assign the likely origins of a variety of commonly available off-the-shelf nutraceuticals in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Oj-SLI0tZTcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/15/9228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P9X4gO5rpjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
