Currently, the predominant sources of these fatty acids are marine fish and algal oils, but research is being conducted to ensure that a sustainable, land-based production system can be developed. We here describe the metabolic engineering of an artificial pathway that produces 26% EPA in leaf triacylglycerol using a newly-identified \u03946-desaturase from the marine microalga Micromonas pusilla. We also demonstrate that this enzyme appears to function as an acyl-CoA desaturase that has preference for \u03c93 substrates both in planta and in yeast. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this desaturase shares highly conserved motifs with previously described acyl-CoA \u03946-desaturases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12270839197042195617", "cites_id": ["12270839197042195617"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717609001074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:obyjazzHSqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 18, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
