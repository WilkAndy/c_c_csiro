Values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in dermis were compared to those obtained from likely species of local prey. The delta C-13 values of zooplankton and nektonic taxa at Ningaloo ranged from -18.9 parts per thousand, to -16.5 parts per thousand reflecting the different carbon sources (from pelagic to more inshore and benthic) entering the food web. Isotopic values also varied depending on the diet-to-tissue discrimination factor applied in the analysis. When data was corrected using factors derived from slow turnover, structural cartilage in fins, whale sharks showed a greater reliance on pelagic food webs, whereas analyses using raw data suggested a greater dietary component from benthic and inshore habitats. Variability in delta N-15 values (6.9 parts per thousand to 10.8 parts per \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:VjBpw8Hezy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16588194820187538915&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
