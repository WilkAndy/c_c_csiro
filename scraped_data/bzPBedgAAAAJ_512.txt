These were compared to isotope values obtained from likely species of local prey. Ontogenetic and sex-related variations in the isotopic composition of dermis were also examined. The \uf06413C values of zooplankton and nektonic taxa at Ningaloo ranged from -18.9\u2030 to -16.5\u2030 reflecting the different carbon sources entering the food web (from a pelagic to a more inshore and benthic productivity). The isotopic composition suggests that whale sharks had greater reliance on pelagic primary and secondary productivity over a period of ~3 years. Whale shark isospace matched some of the potential prey at Ningaloo Reef including krill, zooplankton and polychaetes. Consistency on \uf06413C values indicated regional foraging ranges across the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:6Zm5LS9gQ5UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3699942623019489013&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
