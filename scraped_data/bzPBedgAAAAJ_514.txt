The 200% increase in CO2 by 2100 is predicted to enhance the productivity of fleshy macroalgae that acquire inorganic carbon solely as CO2 (non\u2010carbon dioxide\u2010concen\u2010trating mechanism [CCM] species\u2014ie, species without a carbon dioxide\u2010concentrat\u2010ing mechanism), whereas those that additionally uptake bicarbonate (CCM species) are predicted to respond neutrally or positively depending on their affinity for bicar\u2010bonate. Previous studies, however, show that fleshy macroalgae exhibit a broad vari\u2010ety of responses to CO2 enrichment and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This physiological study compared the responses of a CCM species (Lomentaria australis) with a non\u2010CCM species (Craspedocarpus ramentaceus) to CO2 enrichment with regards to growth, net photosynthesis, and biochemistry. Contrary to expectations, there was no enrichment effect for the non\u2010CCM species, whereas the CCM species had a twofold greater growth rate, likely driven by a downregulation of the energetically costly CCM (s). This saved energy was invested into new growth rather than storage lipids and fatty acids. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive literature synthesis to examine the extent to which the growth and photosynthetic responses of fleshy macroalgae to elevated CO2 are related to their carbon acquisi\u2010tion strategies. Findings highlight that the responses of macroalgae to CO2 enrich\u2010ment cannot be inferred solely from their carbon uptake strategy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:_IsBomjs8bsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.rug.nl/files/102594901/Loos_et_al_2019_Ecology_and_Evolution.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sCODt_zCTisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
