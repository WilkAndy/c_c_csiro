Baseline biochemical data are therefore required in order to gauge any impact the reduction of sea ice will have on the sea ice community. Here we compare lipid class, fatty acid and sterol content and composition of sea ice and water column samples collected during early spring in East Antarctica during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiments (SIPEX II 2012) expedition (110-130E). The availability of key essential omega-3 long\u2013chain (\u2265 C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids, including-20: 5\uf06d 3, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA and 22: 6\uf06d\uf06d 3, docosahexaenoic acid, DHA-the major constituents of cell membranes, were found to be severely limited during late winter and early spring, particularly in the under ice water samples. The ramifications for sea ice obligate organisms such \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://kuleuvencongres.be/scarbiology2017/files/bookofabstracts.pdf#page=390", "cites_per_year": {}}
