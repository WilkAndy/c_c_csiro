Most zooplankton had low percentages of wax esters (0\u20138%, as percent of total lipid). High triacylglycerol levels were found in the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii (68%, as percent of total lipid), the krill (Euphausiacea) Euphausia tricantha (44\u201354% triacylglycerol) and Euphausia frigida (27% triacylglycerol) and the scyphomedusan Periphylla periphylla (42\u201348% triacylglycerol). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) comprised 23\u201360% of the total fatty acids, with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5(n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [22:6(n-3)] being most abundant. P. periphylla was an exception with 12\u201319% docosapentaenoic acid [22:5 (n-3)] being the major PUFA. The major euphausiid sterols included cholesterol (75\u201392%, as percent of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17501129975964117550", "cites_id": ["17501129975964117550"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049198100202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LipI-fyA4PIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 11, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
