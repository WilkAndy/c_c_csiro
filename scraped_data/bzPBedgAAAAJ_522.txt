Elevated concentrations of the bulk organic matter properties in the river samples are consistent with a significant terrestrial/riverine source of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen to the harbour; further supported by the relatively depleted C isotope signature of particulate organic matter in harbour surface waters. However, it is well recognised that a large fraction of catchment derived organic material is likely to be refractory. Comparison of fatty acid profiles of the organic matter in the harbour and key external sources (eg river, ocean and aquafeed) confirmed a lower proportion of the fatty acids indicative of more labile and reactive organic material in river samples.A key finding from the fatty acid and genomic analyses was the significance of organic material produced internally in the harbour water column via microbial production. This has important implications for our current understanding of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen dynamics in the harbour. The prevalence of chemolithoautotrophs (nitrifying bacteria and archaea), that create organic matter using chemical rather than light energy, provides a new source of carbon that will lead to an oxygen demand when mineralised. In the case of these nitrifying organisms, ammonium is the source of energy used to fix carbon (CO2), and our genomic results demonstrate that the distinct physiochemical gradients of Macquarie Harbour influence the distribution and abundance of these microorganisms.
