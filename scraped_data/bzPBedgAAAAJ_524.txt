Potentially limiting environmental conditions, particularly those imposed by sub-optimum temperatures, test the adequacy of nutrient supply and limit the maximum efficiency of growth and nutrient retention. Generally for fish, nutrient requirements have mainly been defined for small juvenile animals held under optimum environmental conditions. In contrast, the majority of aquaculture is conducted outdoors and where fish are subject to periods of sub-optimum environmental conditions. All species have a thermal tolerance range, the range of temperature over which it survives and where growth occurs. The optimal temperature range for Asian sea bass growth is 27-36\u00b0C however, with the expansion of the aquaculture industry from tropical to temperate climates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/112285/", "cites_per_year": {}}
