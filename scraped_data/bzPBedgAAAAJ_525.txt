Fat deposition is altered by both the genetic background and dietary supplements, and this study aimed to assess the effect of dietary Spirulina supplementation levels on the mRNA expression patterns of genes controlling lipid metabolism in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and longissimus dorsi (ld) muscle of Australian crossbred sheep."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NXYAu82O0W8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eprints.utas.edu.au/23218/1/Kashani_whole_thesis.pdf#page=78", "cites_per_year": {}}
