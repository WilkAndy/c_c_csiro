This can be achieved via reduced \u03b2-oxidation of n-3 LC-PUFA or via promoted bioconversion from shorter chain and less unsaturated precursors. Both mechanisms can potentially be induced by balancing the dietary supply of specific fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (Stubhaug et al., 2007, Codabaccus et al., 2012). The present study evaluated whether feeding a diet with a higher DHA:EPA ratio and higher ALA content than from a FO based diet would improve retention efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA in Atlantic salmon smolt. Recent advances in proteomics were used to attempt to gain further insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing lipid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:xGWFX6Gbr9MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/106454/", "cites_per_year": {}}
