A feeding trial was designed to cover a full reproductive cycle in young adult green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, consisting of five diet treatments: the macrophytic algal phaeophyte Egregia menziesii, rhodophyte Chondracanthus canaliculatus, chlorophyte Ulva lobata, a composite of the three algae and a starvation control. The lipid class, fatty acid, sterol and 1-O-alkyl glyceryl ether profiles were determined for foot, hepatopancreas/gonad tissues and larvae. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-7)c, 18:1(n-9)c, 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:5(n-3), as well as 14:0 for abalone fed brown and red algae. 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid, derived from algae, was detected for the first time in H. fulgens (hepatopancreas complex, 1.2\u201313.9%; larvae, 0.5% of total fatty acids). Diacylglyceryl ethers were present in larvae (0.6% of total lipid).
