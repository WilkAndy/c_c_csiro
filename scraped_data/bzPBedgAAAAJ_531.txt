Thus, method development for efficient proteomic analysis of whole fish is required to investigate changes in larvae physiology. Proteome assessment of whole fish is hampered by the presence of high-abundant proteins, which interfere with the detection of low-abundant proteomic components, and consequently hide physiologically significant changes restricted to a certain cell type. Several strategies exist to reduce sample complexity and extend the range of proteins detected. For example, in 2-D gel based proteomics, narrower pH\u2013range IPG strips and larger gels can increase the detection of lower-abundance proteins. Our aim is to develop a robust protein extraction method from whole fish larvae to study changes in protein expression using label-free shotgun proteomics. Different protein extraction methods were compared for their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/93575/", "cites_per_year": {}}
