However, information on growth, diet and condition during winter and early spring is limited, hampering our understanding of these fundamental biological parameters at this important period in their lifecycle. Our study assessed diet and condition of larval and postlarval krill collected from open water and below the ice off East Antarctica(110 a 130 AoE) in September/October 2007. Condition was assessed using lipid content, growth rates and digestive gland size; feeding history was assessed using fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis; and a 207-day starvation study investigated the response of krill to long-term food deprivation. Potential food items(Calanus propinquus and sea-ice biota) were analysed for lipid and fatty acid composition to compare with krill samples. Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12912460961071646117&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pUXGuNRGMrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
