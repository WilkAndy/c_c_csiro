Goats were sequentially offered three diets: control (C) pellets (lucerne hay-oat grain: 60/40 w/w), C plus tuna oil protected against ruminal biohydrogenation (PTO pellets), and C plus unprotected tuna oil (UTO pellets). In supplemented diets, tuna oil constituted 3% of total dry matter (DM), and each supplement was fed for 7 days, with 12 days allowed between the two fish oil feeding periods to minimise carry-over effects. Dry matter intake, milk yield, protein and fat yield were reduced by feeding UTO, but not PTO, pellets. Goats produced \u03c9-3 enriched milk (0.3\u20130.5% EPA and 1.01\u20131.12% DHA) when fed either supplement. The rate of transfer of dietary EPA and DHA to milk ranged from 3.5 to 7.6%.
