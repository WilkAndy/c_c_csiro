Today, Tasmania produces approx. 30000 tones of head-on, gutted salmonids per annum for human consumption. Fish are grown-out in protected high density sea cages, but occasional losses are unavoidable and fish do escape to the natural environment. Salmonids are opportunistic carnivores and therefore their introduction in large numbers in Australian coastal systems is likely to have significant negative impacts on the local ecology if they survive and thrive after escaping. In this study, a multi-faceted approach, including a novel use of the established biochemical techniques stable isotope and fatty acid analyses, was used to determine if salmonids feed on native fauna and thrive after escaping from aquaculture cages in Macquarie Harbour, a large semi-enclosed harbour in western Tasmania.Stomach content analysis indicated that Atlantic salmon do not feed on native fauna as most stomachs were either empty or contained non-nutritious food like twigs and myrtle leaves. For rainbow trout, the proportion of empty stomachs was much lower than for Atlantic salmon (38 vs. 79%), and a large proportion (~ 20%) of stomachs analysed contained feed pellets, including stomachs from fish collected~ 10 km away from the closest fish farms. This indicates that rainbow trout can move away from fish farms, but return to feed on the highly nutritious pellets. About a fifth of the stomachs analysed contained native fauna, including one fish, indicating that rainbow trout escapees have the capability to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/85133905/Salmonid_20Escapee_20Diets.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UusL-gIoYyQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
