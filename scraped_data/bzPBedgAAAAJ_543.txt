Vegetable oil (VO) is the most studied substitute for FO; however, the lack of the health-benefitting omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (\u03c93 LC-PUFA) in VO remains a major short-coming. Feeding fish on a finishing FO diet after grow-out on a VO diet is one strategy to restore the\u03c93 LC-PUFA content in fish, most particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We investigated the restoration of EPA and DHA in rainbow trout fed a finishing FO diet for four weeks following a grow-out period of eleven weeks at two different water temperatures and fed on diets where FO was replaced by 50% or 75% palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). We evaluated whether the fatty acid (FA) composition of fish tissues could be explained by the dilution model and/or other processes. The flesh of rainbow trout fed the 75% PFAD diet showed a decrease of 54 and 51% in EPA, compared to the FO-fed fish, while DHA decreased by 39 and 29% at 15 and 20\u2103, respectively. For whole carcass, a reduction of 46 and 54% in EPA was observed, while DHA was reduced by 36 and 40% at 15 and 20\u2103, respectively. The decrease in EPA and DHA percentage composition for both flesh and whole carcass was lower in fish fed the 50% PFAD diet compared to fish fed the 75% PFAD diet irrespective of water temperature. EPA was restored to 82 and 68% in fish flesh, while DHA restoration was 78 and 76% at temperatures 15 and 20\u2103, respectively, for fish fed on 75 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7783416672380426806&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
