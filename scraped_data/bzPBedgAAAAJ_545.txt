Some plant oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and emerging as practical replacements for FO. Feeding fish on different precursors of\u03c93 long chain (\u2265 C_ (20)) PUFA (LC-PUFA) to increase LC-PUFA content in flesh is of potential interest in aquaculture. To test the preferential utilisation of dietary fatty acids and capacity of barramundi to synthesise LC-PUFA from shorter (C_ (18)) precursors, three identical diets differing only in lipid source were fed to juvenile fish raised in freshwater and seawater for 8 weeks. Oils from Echium plantagineum (EO), rich in SDA (18: 4\u03c93), and from canola (CO), containing ALA (18: 3\u03c93), were compared with a FO diet rich in EPA+ DHA (20: 5\u03c93 (22: 6\u03c93),. FA mass balance showed no significant effects for varied salinity on FA metabolism. Key enzymes involved in FA biosynthesis varied in apparent in vivo activity depending on dietary treatment. EO-fed fish, containing SDA to bypass the rate-limiting\u25b3-6 FA desaturase (FAD6) step within PUFA synthesis pathway, did not show activity for this enzyme, while CO inclusion in diets increased FAD6 and to a less extent when feeding on FO. Higher activity was shown by the downstream\u25b3 5 FA desaturase (FAD5) enzyme needed to synthesise de novo\u03c9-3 LC-PUFA products in EO-fed fish compared to FO and CO. FO-fed fish accumulated oleic acid and showed significantly higher apparent activity for\u25b3 9 FA desaturase (FAD9) compared with the EO and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16805771248808270643&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
