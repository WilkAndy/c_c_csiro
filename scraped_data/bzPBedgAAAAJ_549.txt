The most common dietary source of long-chain omega-3 is through consumption of seafood and fish oil supplements. Common Australian commercial crops of canola and lupin both offer good sources of LC-PUFA precursors, including alpha-linolenic acid [ALA, 18:3(n-3)] and their potential as animal feeds to manipulate LC-PUFA concentrations within animal meat is of great interest to the livestock and human health sectors. This study investigated the LC-PUFA profiles of 38 first cross Merino weaner lambs sired by five genetically divergent rams supplemented with canola meal or cracked lupins at 1 % or 2% of body weight feeding levels for 60 days. Results demonstrated that all animals had 'source' content of omega-3 (EPA+DHA) in muscle samples taken from the short loin (loin chop) equal to or greater than 30mg per 100g serve. 18 animals were in excess of 'good source' content of 60mg per 100g serve with a whole flock mean of 67mg/100g EPA+DHA. When docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) is added to EPA+DHA, only two animals do not reach the 'good source' content of long-chain omega-3. Supplement type significantly (P<0.05) affected the level of ALA, with canola meal-supplemented sheep producing 91mg/100g compared to 66mg/100g in lupin-fed sheep. Total saturated fatty acid levels also showed a significant (P<0.05) interaction with sex and supplement indicating that males fed lupins had the lowest levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/55068/", "cites_per_year": {}}
