While the technique has been used successfully to trace sewage-derived organic matter in a range of environments, it has not been embraced for use as a water quality indicator. This is mostly because of a lack of epidemiological evidence relating coprostanol abundance to any health risk. However, there is a valuable reason why the concentration of coprostanol should be related as quantitatively as possible to the abundance of bacterial indicators currently used to measure faecal pollution. The measurement of coprostanol (and concurrently other faecal sterols) offers many diagnostic and quantitative advantages over traditional techniques for detecting human sewage pollution versus faecal contamination from animal sources. Knowing the amount of coprostanol expected given a certain amount of human sewage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9636462908319488551", "cites_id": ["9636462908319488551"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135496002126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J1qcffWXu4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 7, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 10, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
