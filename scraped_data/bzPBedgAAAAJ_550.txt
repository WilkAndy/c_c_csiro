During the course of lactation, milk-yield follows. a typical curvilinear pattern characterized by an initial increase immediately after calving, a rise to peak before an eventual decline. Cows in mid-lactation are typically in the decline phase and would require supplementation to ensure persistency in milk yield, particularly during summer when pasture availability is limited. This study evaluated the milk yield responses of purebred and crossbred dairy cows to two levels (1 or 2 kg/cow/day) of canola meal or cracked lupins supplementation in a pasture-based production system. Fifty Holstein-Friesian (HF) and Jersey x Holstein-Friesian (JHF) dairy cows (10 unsupplemented control and 40 supplemented) were randomly assigned to treatment groups after balancing for initial milk yield, BCS and days in milk (mean initial milk yield, body weight and body condition scores were 122.5 \u00b1 12.1 litres/d, 352.6 \u00b1 31 kg, and 2.5 respectively). A 2 x 2 x 2 balanced factorial experimental design representing 2 breeds, 2 supplements and 2 feeding levels was utilized. All cows had ad libitum access to the basal diet of barley and ryegrass while supplemented cows had three weeks of adjustment before the 12 weeks of feeding trial commenced. All cows were milked twice daily and milk yield individually recorded automatically at milking. Data were tested for significance by fitting the fixed effects of breed, supplement, feeding level and their first order interactions using mixed model procedures in SAS with cow and days in milk as random effects. Overall differences between treatment means were declared significant at P<0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/55070", "cites_per_year": {}}
