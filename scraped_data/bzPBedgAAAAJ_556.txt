The fish, fed a commercial diet, were held at an elevated water temperature of 19 C. Total n-3 PUFA, total PUFA, and n-3/n-6 and unsaturated/saturated fatty acid (UFA/SFA) ratios in the FA profile of the total lipid extract in the white muscle were fairly low compared with fish grown at 15 C. Adaptation of structural and storage lipids at elevated temperatures was shown by a significant (P< 0.01) reduction in PUFA especially in the percentage of EPA (6\u20138%). Further adaptation was indicated by the percentages of SFA, which were significantly (P< 0.05) higher in gill (56%) and white muscle (58%) polar lipid fractions and coincided with lower percentages of n-3, n-6, and total PUFA. The regiospecific profiles indicated a high affinity of DHA to the sn-2 position in both the TAG (61\u201368%) and polar lipid (35\u201360%) fractions. The combination of detailed regiospecific and lipid analyses demonstrated adaptation of cell membrane structure in Atlantic salmon grown at an elevated water temperature. Paper no. L9837 in Lipids 41, 865\u2013876 (September 2006).Examination of the regiospecificity profile of the lipid classes of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at an elevated temperature of 19 C has yet to be fully investigated. Regiospecificity is the position of individual FA on the glycerol backbone of both storage and membrane lipids. These lipids are present and act in the body as complex molecules and therefore should be studied as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:J4E9jCG1tHUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50619026/Regiospecificity_profiles_of_storage_and20161129-29410-avqgfn.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bcxMFbZRZ2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
