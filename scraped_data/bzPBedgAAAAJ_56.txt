Exponential growth phase cultures of the diatoms, Odontella weissflogii and Chaetoceros simplex, and the Haptophyte, Phaeocystis antarctica, were grown at 2 (\u00b11)\u00b0 and exposed to 16.3 (\u00b10.7) Wm\u22122 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). UV-irradiated treatments were exposed to constant UV-A (4.39 (\u00b10.20) Wm\u22122) and low (0.37 Wm\u22122) or high UV-B (1.59 Wm\u22122). UV-B treatments induced species-specific changes in lipid content and composition. The sterol, fatty acid and total lipid content and profiles for O. weissfloggi changed little under low UV-B when compared with control conditions (PAR alone), but showed a decrease in the lipid content per cell under high UV-B treatment. In contrast, when P. antarctica was exposed to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17983856909502628896", "cites_id": ["17983856909502628896"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942297010686", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IMRbnpN-k_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 10, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
