Marine singlecell oils (SCO) rich in DHA are produced commercially overseas using a heterotrophic dinoflagellate (Crypthecodinium cohnii) and two microheteroptrophs known as thraustochytrids (Schizochytrium sp. and Ulkenia sp.). SCO provide an alternative source of LC-PUFA for incorporation in foods or use as nutraceuticals. Thraustochytrids can be grown heterotrophically using fermentor technology on a large scale with high growth rates and culture density. Objectives--To isolate and characterize new Australian heterotrophic microorganisms capable of LC-PUFA production for potential use in animal feeds, food and nutraceuticals. Design--We isolated and characterised the fatty acid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601638&h=Ju3xGSu7Bdu48fczwts9rkgXGUN3C0rF6juiZFOBakWVmZC7vrIo2YPlQ36rq%2FxsLYuFGY3OcpfA1JdVkB0Hug%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
