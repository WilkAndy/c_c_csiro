Novel dietary lipid sources were included in formulated diets in order to assess the effect on lobster growth and energy utilization in the main energy storage organ, the digestive gland. Objective-To investigate the relationship between dietary lipid source and growth, body lipid composition and histology of the digestive gland in the southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Design-Commercial lipid sources (fish oil, tuna oil, canola oil and lecithin) and marine meals containing lipid (fish meal, squid meal and mussel meal) were formulated to make six isoenergetic and isolipidic diets. Diets were fed to triplicate groups of 15 lobsters (1.5 g) over a 12 week period. Lobster growth, biochemical composition, digestive gland fatty acid, lipid class and histology were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=33908043&h=vxSDPnHWL4bfW57PpInbj9TfNezV5Em3otUhMcQLfwv3kl%2BelTCL2gWNAcgsk0OBdO1JR2HY2IT6topMW5LXcQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
