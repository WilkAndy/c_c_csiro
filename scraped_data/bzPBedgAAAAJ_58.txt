Here, we use multivariate analysis of signature fatty acid (FA) profiles as a complementary method to examine the diet composition of 16 demersal shark and chimaera species, collected off south eastern Australia. Comparative results of FA profiles of potential prey and chondrichthyan species mostly agree with the stomach content data. Multivariate analysis correctly classified chimaeras as prominent low-order and benthic consumers, medium-sized dogfish as predators of mid-trophic fish and squid, catsharks as dominant cephalopod consumers, and larger and deeper dwelling dogfish as feeders of bathypelagic fish, squid and feeding on higher order species (cetaceans \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4304971322585558567", "cites_id": ["4304971322585558567"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098111004199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J6708ptUvjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 18, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 19, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
