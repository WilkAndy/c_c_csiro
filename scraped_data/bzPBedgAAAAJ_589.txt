A large proportion (up to 30%) of PUFA producing bacteria have been isolated from permanently cold environments such as the deep-sea and Antarctic sea ice (1, 2). Investigations of sea ice microbial communities (SIMCOs) from Antarctica have revealed a high diversity of bacterial taxa with the ability to produce PUFA. These include members of the \u03b3-Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides complex. The majority are psychrophilic (requiring low temperatures for growth) and halophilic (requiring the presence of salts for growth) in contrast to the bacteria present in the underlying water (2, 3). PUFA-producing bacteria have gained recognition as an alternative source for human \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/SERVER/APJCN/10/4/%E6%96%B0%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E5%A4%BE/Nichols6.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
