The fatty acids of both algae show a typical dinoflagellate distribution pattern with a predominance of C18, C20 and C22 unsaturated components. The acid 18:5\u03c93 is present at high concentration in these two dinoflagellates. G. wilczeki contains a high proportion (93.4%) of 4-methyl-5\u03b1-stanols including 4,23,24-trimethyl-5\u03b1-cholest-22E-en-3\u03b2-ol (dinosterol), dinostanol and 4,23,24-trimethyl-5\u03b1-cholest-7-en-3\u03b2-ol reported for the first time in dinoflagellates. The role of this sterol in the biosynthesis of 5\u03b1-stanols in dinoflagellates is discussed. P. cordatum contains high concentrations of a number of \u03b4 24(28)-sterols with dinosterol, 24-methylcholesta-5,24(28)-dien-3\u03b2-ol, 23,24-dimethylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, 4,24-dimethyl-5\u03b1-cholest-24(28)-en-3\u03b2-ol and a sterol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3620982852901797008", "cites_id": ["3620982852901797008"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200826059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kPz9TLhQQDIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 6, "1987": 2, "1988": 5, "1989": 7, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 2, "1993": 7, "1994": 0, "1995": 6, "1996": 2, "1997": 5, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
