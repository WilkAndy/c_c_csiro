As PUFAs are necessary constituents of cell membranes and of many cell-signalling systems, deficiencies in dietary PUFAs may lead to poor growth, low vitality and/or disease. The essentiality of PUFAs as dietary components for marine finfish and crustacean larvae has been amply demonstrated (eg Sorgeloos and Leger, 1992).PUFAs are generally classified into two main groups: the omega-6 (\u03c96 or n-6) and omega-3 (\u03c93 or n-3) series. Of the n-6 PUFAs, arachidonic acid [AA; 20: 4 (n-6)] is of particular importance, as it is a major precursor of many prostaglandins and eicosanoids. Eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA; 20: 5 (n-3)] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA; 22: 6 (n-3)] are two n-3 PUFAs which are currently receiving much attention and have been termed \u2018essential\u2019fatty acids."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.frdc.com.au/sites/default/files/products/Hatchery%20Feeds%20-%20Proceedings%20of%20a%20workshop%20held%20in%20Cairns,%209-10%20March%202000.pdf#page=48", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RsXzJWvlkVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
