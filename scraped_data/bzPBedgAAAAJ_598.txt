Subsequent protein fingerprinting of two unknown fillet samples by CSIRO Marine Research showed that the fish were in fact from the marketing group escolar, which consists of two species Lepidocybium flavobrunneum and Ruvettus pretiosus. The samples were identified as L. flavobrunneum, whereas species marketed as rudderfish include Centrophelus niger and Tubbia. Escolar and rudderfish both contain very high levels of oil (17-23%) and their oil compositions are different from most seafood. Escolar oil is rich in wax ester, while rudderfish oil contains mainly diacylglycerol ether (DAGE) or hydrocarbon, predominantly squalene. The purgative properties of wax ester-based oils from escolar and orange roughy have been previously reported, whereas there are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8205329485718281384&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
