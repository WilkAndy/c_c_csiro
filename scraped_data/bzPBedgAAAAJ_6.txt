The technique has permitted (i) chromatographic separation and positive identification of adducts derived fromcis/trans isomers, (ii) characterization of long-chain monounsaturated components (up to 26:1), and (iii) the identification of a wide range of monounsaturated components derived from methanotrophic soil material. The methanotrophic soil sample contained a high relative proportion of the novel phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid 18:1\u0394 10c. The DMDS procedure offers a simple and rapid approach that can be routinely applied to microbial fatty acids derived from environmental samples and monocultures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:sgsej9ZJWHMC", "num_citations": 440, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15903466345086694608,7243150536138772509", "cites_id": ["15903466345086694608", "7243150536138772509"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167701286900230", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0LRFdGF2tNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 5, "1988": 9, "1989": 14, "1990": 7, "1991": 11, "1992": 13, "1993": 10, "1994": 10, "1995": 10, "1996": 9, "1997": 23, "1998": 11, "1999": 11, "2000": 16, "2001": 16, "2002": 11, "2003": 18, "2004": 14, "2005": 17, "2006": 14, "2007": 12, "2008": 15, "2009": 11, "2010": 8, "2011": 13, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 21, "2016": 11, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
