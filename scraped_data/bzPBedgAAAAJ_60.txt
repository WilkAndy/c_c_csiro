Fish were sampled at the Kerguelen Plateau (KP) and Macquarie Ridge (MR) in the Indian and Pacific sectors of the Southern Ocean respectively, to examine geographic variation in lipid compositon. All species of myctophid from KP and Electrona antarctica from MR were high in lipid content (6\u201318% wet mass), particularly Gymnoscopelus nicholsi (18%) and E. antarctica (15%). The mackerel icefish, and G. fraseri and Protomyctophum tenisoni from MR were generally lower in lipid content (3\u20135%) and varied significantly in fatty acid composition from KP species. KP myctophids were high in calorific content (9.3 kJ g\u2013 1 wet mass) when compared \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3133920031821797898", "cites_id": ["3133920031821797898"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-002-0428-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cho4K6rrfSsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 12, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
