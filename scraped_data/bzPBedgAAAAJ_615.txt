They play essential roles in food chains, in biogeochemical cycles, and as mineralizers of anthropogenic pollutants. Since the late 1970s our understanding of prokaryotic biodiversity has been greatly enhanced by the use of molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA sequence comparisons. To date, all Antarctic prokaryotes that have been characterized by phenotypic and molecular techniques have represented new species. The prokaryotes of Antarctica are of broad phylogenetic origin with representatives from both domains, Archaea and Bacteria. Use of the I6S rRNA gene as a molecular clock shows that the Antarctic species diverged from their nearest known non-Antarctic relatives long before Antarctica established as a permanently cold environment. Most Antarctic bacterial species do not function optimally at the temperature of the environment from which they were isolated. Whether or not Antarctic environments contain prokaryotes that are exclusively Antarctic remains an open question."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:u0Mu_IsstPMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13831991765673933716&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lHsf0Tkb9b8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
