Holothurians were rich in phytosterols and algal derived FA such as docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic suggesting tight trophic coupling to phytodetritus. Large proportions of stanols were found, probably a result of enteric bacteria but they may come from sterol metabolism in the holothurians themselves. Oneirophanta mutabilis was distinct with much higher levels of stanols and bacterially derived FA suggesting specific selection of bacteria rich detrital particles or the activity of enteric and integumental bacteria. The ophiuroids sterol and FA compositions differed greatly from the holothurians and reflected consumption of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10191009915650024832", "cites_id": ["10191009915650024832"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590800136X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gKXNJIa9bY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 13, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 15, "2023": 1}}
