The East Australian Current was the dominant oceanographic influence during the January 1989 sampling. Phosphate concentrations ranged from 0.2-0.4 \u00b5M and nitrate was in the range 0.1- 3.6 \u00b5M. The 1989 results provide an indication of base-line nutrient concentrations in the region under these oceanographic conditions. During the 1992 and 1993 research cruises, the oceanographic conditions were considerably more complex; nutrients-rich waters arrived in a number of ways: as an intrusion from the nearby continental slope and as a cold, upwelled plume originating several hundred kilometres further north. In addition to these natural inputs, the deep water outfalls are another source of nutrients. For the 1992 sampling, dissolved phosphate levels (0.8-1.5 \u00b5M) in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.370348343941148", "cites_per_year": {}}
