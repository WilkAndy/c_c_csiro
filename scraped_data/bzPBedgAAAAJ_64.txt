Winter values were fairly constant near \u221220\u2030 before increasing to above \u221215\u2030 in response to inputs from sea-ice algae in early spring. Particulate organic matter obtained directly from sea-ice cores exhibited very high \u03b413COM values, typically \u221215\u2030 but as much as \u22128\u2030, much above the values of organic matter suspended in the water column below the sea ice. The sea-ice algae contributed \u223c20% of the annual flux of organic matter, and the \u03b413COM measurements from a sediment core at the site suggest that this value is representative of the recent past. All of these carbon isotopic compositions are considerably above the extremely \u03b413C-depleted compositions (generally \u221225\u2030 to \u221230\u2030) that have been found in many \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10332529635582949834", "cites_id": ["10332529635582949834"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/27/4/331/207078", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yjkeoPWEZI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 7, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
