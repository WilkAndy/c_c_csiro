The flesh has high levels of vitamin A, iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and selenium. Its fat (18.7 g per l00 g flesh) has a high proportion of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (9.3% of total fatty acids). The oil, which comprises 64% waxes and 32% triglycerides, is similarly rich in omega-3 fatty acids (24.9% of total fatty acids). The amounts are such that a typical Australian's intake of omega-3 fatty acids would be at least doubled by consuming 100 g of the flesh per week, or 1 g oil per day. The available and potential supply of mutton bird flesh and oil is substantial. For those who consume it regularly, the flesh may assist in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Regular consumption may also assist in the management of individuals with atherogenic and thrombogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:iKswqCX-FLkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13225145357461164311&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FxFh_qEnibcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
