In the water column, methanogenic bacterial phospholipids were present below 17 m in depth at concentrations which converted to a biomass of between 1 and 7\u00d7108 cells/liter. Methanogenic biomass in the sediment ranged from 17.7\u00d7109 cells/g dry weight of sediment at the surface to 0.1\u00d7109 cells/g dry weight at 2 m in depth. This relatively high methanogenic biomass implies that current microbial degradation of organic carbon in Ace Lake sediments may occur at extremely slow rates. Total microbial biomass increased from 4.4\u00d7108 cells/ liter at 2 m in depth to 19.4\u00d7108 cells/liter at 23 m, near the bottom of the water column. Total nonarchaebacterial biomass decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7127573607419676028", "cites_id": ["7127573607419676028"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02015055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fAWztG466mIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 4, "1992": 7, "1993": 6, "1994": 3, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 9, "1998": 7, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
