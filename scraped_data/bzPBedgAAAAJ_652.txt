For measurements down to 800 m, a Variosens III was interfaced with a Neil Brown CTD. In addition to in situ fluorescence, the Variosens III enabled us to measure profiles of turbidity.Underway surface measurements of pH, in situ fluorescence, temperature and salinity were made by diverting some of the water from a thermosalinograph through a Turner Fluorometer and a pH cell. All four parameters were logged 75 times a minute and the data was stored on a VEX computer. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p. coz) in the surface waters was calculated from the pH. Simultaneous measurements of a range of parameters enabled us interpret changes in poor on the basis of physical and biological processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:5F1dSjz1ScoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13935652409508426855&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
