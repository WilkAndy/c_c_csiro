Metabolic activities of the communities were determined by incorpora-tion of [3H] thymidine into bacterial DNA and sodium [MCIacetate into membrane lipids. Bio\u2014mass measurements from extractable phospholipid fatty acids per g dry wt. ranged between 6 to 76 nmol, or when converted to number of bacteria, 3.7 X 108 to 4.5 X 109 cells per g dry wt. The West Sound site at New Harbor contained the lowest biomass, while Cape Evans on the East Sound contained the greatest. A marked difference was also noted between sites in their sediment micro-bial community structure.
