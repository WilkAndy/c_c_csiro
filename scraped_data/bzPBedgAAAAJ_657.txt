Phycol", "volume": "19", "pages": "416-420", "abstract": "The fatty acid, sterol and chlorophyll conposition of the calcified, unicellular alga Thoracosphaera heimii (Lohmann) Kamptner are reported. The presence of 4, 23, 24-trinethyl-5a-cholest-22E-en-33-ol (dinosterol) 4, 23, 24-trimethyl-5o-cholesi-22E-en-3-one (dinosierone) and the predominance of C, C, and C, un saturated fatty acids, including the acid l8: 53, indicates that T. heimii is a dinoflagellate. The fatty acidsterol ratio (1.3), is typical of dinoflagellates. The geochemical significance of dinosterone, the high relative concentration of 4-desmethyl-5c-stanols and the role of 23-methyl-5a-cho-lesi-22E-en-38-ol in the biosynthesis of dinosterol in T. heimii are also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yIeBiWEAh44C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1179473366289074991&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L8uxC8dUXhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
