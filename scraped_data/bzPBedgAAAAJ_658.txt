This research investigated the effect of dietary inclusion of incremental levels of CDCO on the expression of Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), B-cell translocation gene-2 (BTG2) and Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) genes involved in reproduction and lipid synthesis. We tested the hypothesis that post-partum supplementation of primiparous Holstein-Friesian cows with dietary CDCO in a pasturebased system will alter the relative mRNA abundance and expression of AANAT, BTG2 and FASN genes associated with lipid metabolism. A random allocation of twenty primiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows into four treatment groups comprising wheat-based pelleted basal diet with no supplemental CDCO (control), or a wheat-based pelleted basal diet with CDCO added at 25 ml/kgDM (low), 35 ml/kgDM (medium) and 50 ml/kgDM (high) was utilized in a ten-week experimental feeding trial including two weeks of adjustment. Blood samples were subjected to mRNA extraction and reverse transcription using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to assess the mRNA expression levels of the AANAT, BTG2 and FASN genes. Both level and duration of supplementation with CDCO were significant sources of variation (P< 0.05) that influenced BTG2 expression, while the expressions of AANAT and FASN genes were unaffected (P> 0.05 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:aDl3D7KC1E4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78498291.pdf#page=183", "cites_per_year": {}}
