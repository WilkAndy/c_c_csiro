The major lipid class in all species was phospholipid (78%\u201395%), with low levels of triacylglycerol (TAG; 0%\u201316%) and free fatty acid (FFA; 1%\u201311%). The common dinoflagellate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), octadecapentaenoic acid (OPA 18:5\u03c93), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6\u03c93), were present in all species in varying amounts (14%\u201335% and 8%\u201323%, respectively). The very\u2010long\u2010chain PUFA (VLC\u2010PUFA) 28:7\u03c96 and 28:8\u03c93 were present at low levels (<1%), and the ratio of these fatty acids may be a useful chemotaxonomic marker at the species level. The typical dinoflagellate sterol dinosterol was absent from all species tested. A predominance of the 4\u2010methyl and 4\u2010desmethyl \u03948(14) sterols in all dinoflagellate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6791322843750263133", "cites_id": ["6791322843750263133"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00312.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xem6-CSgP14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 14, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 2, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
