During this study (Jan 2014\u2013Sep 2016) satellite-derived sea surface temperatures had the greatest variability in the South Orkney Islands (SOI), ranging from\u2212 1.28 to 1.93 C (average 0.33\u00b10.86 C), followed by South Georgia (SG) where temperatures ranged from\u2212 1.10 to 1.49 C (average 0.49\u00b10.54 C) and the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) which ranged from\u2212 1.28 to 0.94 C (average\u2212 0.25\u00b10.78 C). Temperatures decreased from summer into autumn in the WAP and SOI, and from the start of winter to spring in SG. However, in 2016, SST at WAP increased from summer into autumn and then decreased from early autumn onwards (Supplementary Fig. 1).Chlorophyll a concentrations. The levels of Chl a varied depending on the location and the season (Supplementary Fig. 2). Values of more than 5.78 mg m\u2212 2 of Chl a were observed in the SOI, and as low as 0.19 mg m\u2212 2 Chl a in SG. Chl a increased in summer and decreased rapidly during the autumn of 2014 around the SOI. Chl a concentrations in other years were more consistent, although very few satellite measurements were recorded at SG due to the time of year, cloud cover, ice cover and suboptimal sun angle. Chl a varied the most around the SOI, ranging from 0.24 to 5.78 mg m\u2212 2 (average 0.88\u00b10.85 mg m\u2212 2), followed by the WAP which ranged from 0.20 to 1.34 mg m\u2212 2 (average 0.62\u00b10.30 mg m\u2212 2), and SG which ranged from 0.19 to 0.62 mg m\u2212 2 (average 0.39\u00b10.11 mg m\u2212 2). SG had the smallest range of Chl a concentrations and the lowest average Chl a concentration. SOI had the biggest range of Chl a concentrations and the highest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:1_W9tMSvGuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/82364812/s41598-020-62800-7.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_NjtYY0CX_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
