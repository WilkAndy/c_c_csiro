Phleger\"*, Jock W. Young \u201c, Michaela Guest \u201c", "citation": "", "author": "Matt Lansdell and Peter D Nichols", "abstract": "Methods The diet of wild-caught swordfish from eastern Australia was examined through signature fatty acid analysis of swordfish and a range of keyprey species, with an emphasis on squid and myctophid fishes. Muscle tissue was collected from swordfish (size range 89-203 cm orbit to fork length) from waters of eastern Australia (Young et al., 2006). Samples were extracted and the fatty acids were prepared and analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry using methods described in Phillips et al.(2001) and Phleger et al.(2005). The fatty acid compositions (%) comprising 61 fatty acids detected in all species were compared using non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) with a Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient (Clark and Gorley, 2006)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:as0KMg8qHbkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4556676831038837577&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SZNSfm-RPD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
