Any heterologous expression platform capable of providing a rapid estimation of the functional assembly of an entire pathway would guide the design of such transgenic traits. In this study, we use a Nicotiana benthamiana transient leaf expression system to simultaneously express five genes, from five independent TDNA binary vectors, to assemble a complete recombinant pathway in five\u2003days. In this study, we demonstrate the production of long\u2010chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC\u2010PUFA) requiring five transgene\u2010encoded reactions to convert endogenous fatty acids to LC\u2010PUFA. The addition of a triacylglycerol assembly enzyme, Arabidopsis thaliana diacylglyceride\u2010O\u2010acyltransferase, and fractionation of the total lipid profile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14699210049372381355", "cites_id": ["14699210049372381355"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2009.00453.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q2Cx_6gV_ssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
