Salmon (37 g) were fed for 51 days on diets containing only canola oil (CO), canola and fish oil (CFO) or canola and the thraustochytrid meal (CTH). There were no significant differences in final weight (106.1 \u0105 1.1 g), weight gain (69.6 \u0105 1.1 g), feed consumption (16.5 \u0105 0.2 mg dry matter. g-1. d-1), feed efficiency ratio (1.15 \u0105 0.03 gg-1) or productive protein value (51.2 \u0105 1.7%) between the diets. Nor were there any significant differences in whole-body chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, total lipid) or organ somatic indices (liver, heart, eye). There were significant differences in apparent digestibility coefficients for total lipid (P< 0.01) and phosphorus (P< 0.05) but these were small and not thought to be of biological significance. There were no differences in apparent digestibility coefficients for energy or crude protein. Fatty acid digestibility values were very high (> 99%) for all fatty acids and differences between the diets were very small. There were no significant differences in measures of immune function (plasma concentrations of neutrophil, lysozyme, antiprotease). However, cumulative mortality was significantly (P< 0.05) lower in fish fed CFO (68% mortality) than the other two diets (92% mortality) following transfer to seawater and two challenges with Vibrio anguillarum. Compared to differences in lipid distribution and the ability to withstand disease challenge growth performance measures were not as sensitive as indicators of dietary induced changes in salmon."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.frdc.com.au/sites/default/files/products/1998-322-DLD.pdf#page=125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tB8HH3I2n5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
