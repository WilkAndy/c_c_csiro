Results derived from the combined use of sterol biomarkers (e.g. coprostanol and 24-ethylcoprostanol) and four sub-groups of bacterial indicators (e.g. thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci) indicated that during wet weather, all sites sampled were affected by significant human faecal contamination. Ratios of coprostanol to bacterial indicators were similar to those for samples collected from nearby sewer mains. During dry weather, there were still severely elevated levels of faecal contamination based on bacterial indicators, but correspondingly low concentrations of faecal sterols suggesting minimal human or herbivore faecal contamination. The origin of the majority of the faecal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14625573336339748488", "cites_id": ["14625573336339748488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122398007288", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iJb0tHV5-MoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
