It exhibits spontaneous combustion such that piles of coal can heat to over 100 o C. Ferrous-iron oxidising bacteria were enriched from samples of heated coal using a medium at pH 1.8 containing 4 g/L FeSO 4. 7H 2 O, over the temperature range 50 o C to 63 o C. Samples were used to inoculate a fluidised-bed reactor (FBR) which was run at 60 o C. Pure strains of ferrous-oxidising bacteria were isolated from the bioreactor and from some of the original coal samples. An incubation temperature of 50 o C was chosen as attempts to isolate ferrous-iron oxidising bacteria at 60 o C had been unsuccessful. These strains were isolated using the same medium as that used for the initial enrichment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=286466416289296737&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YbEAF7C7-QMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
