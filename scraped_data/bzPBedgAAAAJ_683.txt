The nutritional value of Australian species was determined with respect to oil composition, as was how oil content may differ with geographical region, taxonomic group and other factors. This knowledge has been transferred, in various formats, to the Fishing Industry, nutritionists and other consumer groups to better utilize the total catch, including waste products."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8561694423562261965&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
