While Macquarie Harbour is grossly polluted from mine operations via contamination of the King River, Bathurst Harbour is surrounded by World Heritage wilderness and is essentially free of anthropogenic influences. The vegetation of the catchments of both harbours is similar and the waters of both harbours are deep brown due to the presence of humic substances. A hydrographic survey of the pristine Bathurst Harbour estuarine system was carried out over 4 days in January/February of 1990 (Austral Summer). Sampling and laboratory analyses for a range of trace elements (Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) were made using non-contaminating procedures. Comparison of results from this survey, with those from Macquarie Harbour in the summer of 1989, provided a clearer assessment of the effects of mining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2494411427587899100&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
