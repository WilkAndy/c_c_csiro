Flexibacter spp were much more heterogeneous indicating a low genetic similarity. These results were also reflected in the membrane fatty acids of the bacteria. TheVitreoscilla strains were very similar with the 16:1\u03c97c fatty acid being dominant. The membrane fatty acids ofF. limicola were dominated by a15:0 and a17:0 components which provided additional support for its relatedness to the genusBacillus. There was much greater diversity in the fatty acid patterns of theFlexibacter spp.F. aurantiacus, F. ruber andF. elegans shared the common dominant fatty acids 16:1\u03c97c with theVitreoscilla strains, but this was replaced by the 16:1\u03c96c acid inF. flexilis. F. ruber was distinguished by the absence of branched odd-chain monounsaturated fatty acids andF \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15700394764945425597", "cites_id": ["15700394764945425597"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00690149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vYT5vdoB49kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
