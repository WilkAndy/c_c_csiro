When the results of these studies were related to the results of a study based on genomic physicochemical properties, they clarified group I and II methanotroph genus and species interrelationships. The group I methanotrophs were found to be made up of three broadly phenotypically and genotypically homologous clusters of species. The first group I methanotroph cluster included the carotenoid-containing species Methylomonas methanica, Methylomonas fodinarum, and Methylomonas aurantiaca. These species represent the true members of the genus Methylomonas. The second group I methanotroph cluster was made up of two subclusters of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 418, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6176535644259770942,10806343463589693067", "cites_id": ["6176535644259770942", "10806343463589693067"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/00207713-43-4-735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PmKkmnF2t1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 5, "1998": 9, "1999": 15, "2000": 10, "2001": 11, "2002": 7, "2003": 11, "2004": 6, "2005": 18, "2006": 10, "2007": 15, "2008": 17, "2009": 10, "2010": 10, "2011": 19, "2012": 13, "2013": 21, "2014": 18, "2015": 33, "2016": 19, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 21, "2020": 31, "2021": 23, "2022": 15, "2023": 7}}
