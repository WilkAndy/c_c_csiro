As an animal increases in size and matures sexually, many biochemical changes take place within the animal. It was hypothesized that maintenance of neutral buoyancy in deep-sea sharks involves fine-scale changes in the chemical composition of the liver oil as individual sharks grow and develop. To test this hypothesis, the lipid composition of liver oil for individuals of different size and sex of deep-sea sharks from the Chatham Rise, New Zealand was compared. The composition of liver oil varied within and among species. Several species contained large amounts of squalene and DAGE, whereas only traces of these lipids were present in other species. The amounts of squalene and DAGE in liver oil were inversely related, and squalene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9213224912918525626", "cites_id": ["9213224912918525626"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049100001541", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:urZJmj7z238J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
