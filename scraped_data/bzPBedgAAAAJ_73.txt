Oil from a plant source Echium plantagineum L., Boraginaceae, has high levels of stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4\u03c93, 14%) a biosynthetic precursor of omega-3 long-chain (\u2265C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c93 LC-PUFA). Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr were fed a control fish oil diet (FO) or one of 3 experimental diets with 100% canola oil (CO) 100% SDA oil (SO), and a 1:1 mix of CO and SDA oil (MX) for 42 days. There were no differences in the growth or feed efficiency between the four diets. However, there were significant differences in the fatty acid (FA) profiles of the red and white muscle tissues. Significantly higher amounts of SDA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5\u03c93, EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6\u03c93, DHA) and total \u03c93 FA occurred in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6590941302286937476", "cites_id": ["6590941302286937476"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590600368X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hG1DsjG6d1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 13, "2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
