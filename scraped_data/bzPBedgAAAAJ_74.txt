Soil samples from selected locations onshore were also analysed to ascertain the extent of hydrocarbon contamination emanating from fuel storage facilities and other potential sources. The faecal sterol coprostanol was detected at 13.2 \u03bcg g\u22121 (60% of total sterols) in sediment adjacent to the Davis sewage outfall and up to 5.0 \u03bcg g\u22121 on the shoreline at Davis Beach. These concentrations indicate significant faecal contamination. The absence of coprostanol in faeces from the local wildlife confirms a human origin for this sewage biomarker. Hydrocarbons on the shoreline near Davis were present at up to 5.5 \u03bcg g\u22121 (dry weight of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14508814744159975141", "cites_id": ["14508814744159975141"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/hydrocarbons-and-sterols-in-marine-sediments-and-soils-at-davis-station-antarctica-a-survey-for-humanderived-contaminants/55532FE12C5E4FFE2301AF88ED33A133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5faaiSOqWckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 9, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
