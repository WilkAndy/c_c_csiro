In this study, we compared eight new endemic Australian thraustochytrid strains from the genera Aurantiochytrium, Schizochytrium, Thraustochytrium, and Ulkenia for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide (EPS), in addition to biodiesel and LC-PUFA. Aurantiochytrium sp. strains readily utilized glucose for biomass production, and increasing glucose from 2 to 4 % w/v of the culture medium resulted in increased biomass yield by an average factor of 1.7. Ulkenia sp. strain TC 010 and Thraustochytrium sp. strain TC 033 did not utilize glucose, while Schizochytrium sp. strain TC 002 utilized less than half the glucose available by day 14, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4165168840967902480,8099852876769758451", "cites_id": ["4165168840967902480", "8099852876769758451"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10126-014-9560-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ENVqK_6mzTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 8, "2020": 20, "2021": 15, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
