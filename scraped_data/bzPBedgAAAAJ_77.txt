However, the presence of vertical stratification in FA distribution throughout blubber complicates the application of FASA to marine mammals. Blubber biopsy samples were collected from adult female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) from Macquarie Island (n=11), and blubber cores were divided into inner and outer sections to determine the degree to which the blubber layer was stratified in FA composition, we found 19 FA from both blubber layers in greater than trace amounts (>0.5%). The inner and outer blubber layers could be separated using principal components analysis based on the relative proportion of FA in each layer. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also observed in significantly higher proportions in the inner blubber layer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2286738466984051454", "cites_id": ["2286738466984051454"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590200252X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_kLOIoUgvB8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 10, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
