Molecular markers such as fecal sterols, however, may overcome shortcomings of the classical bacterial indicators. The principal human fecal sterol is coprostanol (5\u03b2-cholestan-3\u03b2-ol), whilst herbivore feces are dominated by C29 sterols (24-ethylcoprostanol and 24-ethylcholesterol). In a pilot investigation, combined fecal sterol and bacterial indicator measurements were used to distinguish fecal pollution from human, herbivore, domestic pet and bird inputs in inland waters during a rain event. Native birds were found to be a major source of the fecal pollution. In a further application of the molecular marker technique in marine waters, Sydney's coastal environment was surveyed before (1989) and after (1992 and 1993 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9122471466380925327", "cites_id": ["9122471466380925327"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1997-0671.ch020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j5lFO3eHmX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
