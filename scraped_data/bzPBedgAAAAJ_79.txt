Biodiscovery of thraustochytrids from Tasmania (temperate) and Queensland (tropical), Australia, covered a biogeographic range of habitats including fresh, brackish, and marine waters. A total of 36 thraustochytrid strains were isolated and separated into eight chemotaxonomic groups (A\u2013H) based on fatty acid (FA) and sterol composition which clustered closely with four different genera obtained by 18S rDNA molecular identification. Differences in the relative proportions (%FA) of long-chain C20, C22, omega-3, and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and saturated FA, as well as the presence of odd-chain PUFA (OC-PUFA) were the major factors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=164967260057293978", "cites_id": ["164967260057293978"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-011-3856-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mtRIV9kUSgIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
