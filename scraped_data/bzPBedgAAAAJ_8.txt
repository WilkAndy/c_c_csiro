Superimposed upon the intrinsic acid tolerance of individual strains, acid habituation significantly enhances the survival of exponential phase cultures exposed to a lethal acid challenge (pH 3.0), and minimises inter-strain variability in acid tolerance. The fatty acid composition of acid habituated, non-habituated, and de-habituated exponential phase cultures is also reported. During acid habituation, monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1\u03c97c and 18:1\u03c97c) present in the phospholipids of E. coli are either converted to their cyclopropane derivatives (cy17:0 and cy19:0), or replaced by saturated fatty acids. The acid tolerance of individual strains of E. coli appears to be correlated with membrane cyclopropane fatty acid content and, thus, it is postulated that increased levels of cyclopropane fatty acids may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 341, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7525203755254594965", "cites_id": ["7525203755254594965"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160597000688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lb1i9vHkbmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 14, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 15, "2003": 15, "2004": 12, "2005": 11, "2006": 10, "2007": 10, "2008": 14, "2009": 14, "2010": 20, "2011": 20, "2012": 20, "2013": 22, "2014": 16, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 14, "2020": 14, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
