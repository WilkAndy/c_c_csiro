This allochthonous resource is therefore likely to be important to consumers, but the various components of the resource likely play different roles in the food webs. We traced sources of production for the abundant amphipod Allorchestes compressa and 2 key predatory fishes in the surf zone of southwestern Australia using multiple stable isotopes (\u03b4 13 C, \u03b4 15 N and \u03b4 34 S) and fatty acids. Seagrasses had higher \u03b4 13 C than macroalgae, while \u03b4 13 C of red and brown macroalgae were similar. Mixing models based on \u03b4 13 C were ambiguous and indicated that brown algae and seagrasses were both feasible carbon sources for A. compressa. \u03b4 15 N varied little between seagrasses and macroalgae, while \u03b4 15 N of amphipods was higher and \u03b4 15 N of fish higher again. \u03b4 34 S \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6980839157060021666", "cites_id": ["6980839157060021666"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v376/p33-44/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oi2zLjrs4GAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
