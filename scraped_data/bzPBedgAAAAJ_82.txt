Humans biosynthesize only small amounts of LC-omega-3, so they are considered semi-essential nutrients in our diet. Concern has been raised that farmed fish now contain lower LC omega-3 content than wild-harvested seafood due to the use of oil blending in diets fed to farmed fish. However, we observed that two major Australian farmed finfish species, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and barramundi (Lates calcifer), have higher oil and LC omega-3 content than the same or other species from the wild, and remain an excellent means to achieve substantial intake of LC omega-3 oils. Notwithstanding, LC omega-3 oil content has decreased in these two farmed species, due largely to replacing dietary fish oil with poultry oil. For Atlantic salmon, LC omega-3 content decreased ~30%\u201350% between 2002 and 2013, and the omega-3/omega-6 ratio also decreased (>5:1 to <1:1). Australian consumers increasingly seek their LC omega-3 from supplements, therefore a range of supplement products were compared. The development and future application of oilseeds containing LC omega-3 oils and their incorporation in aquafeeds would allow these health-benefitting oils to be maximized in farmed Australian seafood. Such advances can assist with preventative health care, fisheries management, aquaculture nutrition, an innovative feed/food industry and ultimately towards improved consumer health."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:z8nqeaKD1nsC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15999085765635752007", "cites_id": ["15999085765635752007"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/3/1063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R0C6r7wrCN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 17, "2017": 17, "2018": 7, "2019": 16, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 6}}
