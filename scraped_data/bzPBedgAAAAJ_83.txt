Enrichments from only one of the lakes produced growth and two strains were isolated that were very similar in phenotype and fatty acid profile, and shared considerable homology in their DNA (DNA\u2013DNA hybridization = 93\u00b17%). The strains were psychrotrophic with theoretical Tmax, Tmin and Topt of 30\u201331, \u20137 \u00b0 and 26 \u00b0C, respectively. The \u03b2-galactosidase in cell extracts had an optimal activity at 39 C. The strains were Gram-negative rods, showed gliding motility, contained branched and hydroxy fatty acids, and menaquinone 6 as the major respiratory quinone. The strains did not form microcysts and utilized lactose while using ammonium ions as a source of nitrogen, and a range of other sugars. The G+C content of the DNA was 34 mol%.
