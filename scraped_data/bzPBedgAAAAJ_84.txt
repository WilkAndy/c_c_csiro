Using signature fatty acid (FA) analyses from their subdermal connective tissue and stomach content analysis, we tested whether whale sharks in Mozambique and South Africa predominantly feed on these prey and/or what other prey they target. Arachidonic acid (20: 4\u03c96; mean\u00b1SD= 17.8\u00b12.0% of total FA), 18: 0 and 18: 1\u03c99c were major FA of whale sharks, while in contrast, coastal epipelagic zooplankton collected near feeding whale sharks had 22: 6\u03c93 (docosahexaenoic acid), 16: 0 and 20: 5\u03c93 (eicosapentaenoic acid) as major FA. Stomach contents of 3 stranded sharks were dominated by mysids (61 to 92% of prey items), another one by sergestids (56%), and a fifth stomach was empty. The dominant mysids (82% index of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7160694247698701741", "cites_id": ["7160694247698701741"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v493/p219-235/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rZ1Ds3rlX2MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 20, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
