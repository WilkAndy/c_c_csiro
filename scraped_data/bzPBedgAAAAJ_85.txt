Three cDNA sequences, designated PsD4Des, PsD5Des, PsD8Des, were isolated from P. salina and shown to encode three front-end desaturases with \u03944, \u03945 and \u03948 specificity, respectively. Southern analysis indicated that the P. salina genome contained single copies of all three front-end fatty acid desaturase genes. When grown at three different temperatures, analysis of fatty acid profiles indicated P. salina desaturation conversions occurred with greater than 95% efficiency. Real-Time PCR revealed that expression of PsD8Des was higher than for the other two genes under normal growth conditions, while PsD5Des had the lowest expression level.
