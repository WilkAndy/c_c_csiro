Two sterols were detected, trans-22-dehydrocholesterol (66% of total sterols) and cholesterol (34%); no sterols containing alkyl groups at the C24 position were present. The major fatty acids in N. cylindrus, 16:1\u03949c, 14:0, 16:0, 20:5\u03945,8,11,14,17 and 20:4\u03945,8,11,14, were typical of previous reports of diatom fatty acids. A number of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids were also detected, with higher relative proportions present in the phospholipid fraction. GC-MS analysis of the dimethyldisulphide adducts of these monounsaturated components showed that 24: 1\u039413c, 24:1\u039415c, 26:1\u039415c and 26:1\u039417c were the major components. The distribution of these fatty acids suggests that chain elongation of monounsaturated fatty acids was occurring in N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3410652111901611481", "cites_id": ["3410652111901611481"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200812285", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2dVUfgYSVS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 7, "1990": 2, "1991": 10, "1992": 2, "1993": 7, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
