The coprostanol concentration in field samples readily provided an estimate of human fecal pollution. The technique was successfully used for stormwater, the sea-surface microlayer, beach sands and greases, and in regional studies of coastal sediments. Sterol profiles can be used to distinguish human and non-human sources of sewage pollution and algal blooms. Development of appropriate component ratios, both within the sterol fraction and between compounds classes, may provide a useful mechanism to further exploit sterol data. For sewage-containing samples, it may be possible to extend the data comparison, and calculation of key ratios, to include bacteriological parameters.
