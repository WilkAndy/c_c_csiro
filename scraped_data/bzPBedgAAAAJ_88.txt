In supplemented diets, tuna oil constituted 3% (w/w) of total dry matter (DM), and each supplement was fed for 12 days, with 9 days allowed between the two fish oil feeding periods to minimise carry-over effects. Daily DM intake was 785\u00b138g/head during the control period. It was significantly reduced by UTO feeding (6.2%, P<0.05) but not PTO feeding. The level of EPA in the abomasum during PTO feeding was double that measured during UTO feeding (1.30 versus 0.61% of FA, P<0.05). The level of DHA in the abomasum did not significantly differ between UTO and PTO feeding periods.
