Prokaryotic organisms dominated the benthic assemblages in both wetlands. Total prokaryotic abundance (i.e. eubacteria plus archaea) was estimated to be (7-17) \u00d7 109 cells g-1 sediment (dry weight). Methanogenic archaea were estimated to number (1-5.4) \u00d7 109 cells g-1 and to account for 11-36% of the total benthic prokaryotes; these values are apparently among the highest recorded for temperate lake or river environments. PLFAs indicative of specific metabolic groups (e.g. sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanotrophic bacteria, etc.) were also detected.
