Lipid class analysis of pueruli caught from two locations across the continental shelf showed that phospholipid predominated (86\u201396% of total lipid), with only smaller proportions of sterol (0.9\u20138.7%) and diacylglycerol (1.2\u20137.6%). Only traces of triacylglycerol, hydrocarbon and wax ester were present (<0.1% of total lipid). Comparison of the lipid class content of pueruli caught onshore and offshore showed that phospholipid reserves are primarily utilised during this important phase in the lifecycle and that diacylglycerol plays a less significant secondary role. Histology identified concentrations of phospholipid in fat bodies located in the haemocoel. The use of phospholipid as the dominant storage medium in the puerulus stage is unlike many other marine taxa, including \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13798983603604967507", "cites_id": ["13798983603604967507"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1095643300003482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U1BQMnrWf78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 12, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
