A range of C27-C29 sterols were detected. The major sterols found at the three sites were 24-methylcholesta-5, 22E-diene-3\u03b2-ol (Cape Armitage); trans-22-dehydrocholesterol, 24-ethylcholesterol and 24-methylenecholesta (Erebus Ice Tongue); and 24-methylenecholesterol (Cape Royds). The difference in sterol profiles is believed to reflect the differing species composition at each site. The high relative levels (as % of total) of 24-ethylcholesterol at the Erebus Ice Tongue site (possibly related to Amphiprora kufferathii) supports the proposal that diatoms are a more probable source of C29 sterols in Antarctic lakes than are other algal groups or cyanobacteria \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6379858525013792491", "cites_id": ["6379858525013792491"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/fatty-acid-sterol-and-hydrocarbon-composition-of-antarctic-sea-ice-diatom-communities-during-the-spring-bloom-in-mcmurdo-sound/4B332A24C6BAA497F22F14A09297B1F3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:69axzIbPiVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
