Seagrass detritus is known to be important in food webs of benthic coastal communities, but extensive utilization of buoyant seagrass detritus by planktonic microheterotrophs has not been reported. Offshore transport of seagrass detritus by storms occurs frequently and such detritus may be a common and important, but highly variable, source of production for coastal planktonic ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16034184942743969938", "cites_id": ["16034184942743969938"], "pub_url": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.1992.37.8.1754", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kuArr0DehN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 6}}
