Polar lipids were the dominant class. Significant variation occurred between strains in the amount of lipid per cell; lipid content varied from 3.5 pg/cell for the axenic spherical colony forming strain Al-3, to 8.2 pg/cell for the largely flagellate strain DE10 and 7.7 pg/cell for the benthic strain. The dominant sterol was 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol irrespective of culture age or life stage composition. The major fatty acids for strain Al-3 were: 16:0, 18:1\u03c99c, 14:0 and 18:0, while profiles for strains DE10 and Al-4 contained 14:0, 16:0, 18:1\u03c99c and 18: 0. The essential fatty acids 20:5\u03c93 and 22:6\u03c93 were only minor or trace components, demonstrating the poor nutritional quality (with respect to fatty acids) of Phaeocystis to Antarctic grazers. However, the lipid and fatty acid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10594135676180211410", "cites_id": ["10594135676180211410"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003194229183177M", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0qYDcUTuBZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
