These strains were able to utilize humic compounds (tannic acid) and derivatives (2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate) as sole carbon sources and as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration. The major fatty acids were typical of the genus Shewanella; however, PUFAs mostly made up of eicosapentaenoic acid were produced at high levels (10.2-23.6% of total fatty acids) and at relatively high incubation temperatures (10.2% at 24 degrees C). Sequence analysis indicated that ACEM 6 and ACEM 9(T) had identical 16S rDNA sequences and were most closely related to Shewanella japonica (sequence similarity 97.1%). DNA hybridization and phenotypic characteristics confirmed that the isolates constituted a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13570942901452934035", "cites_id": ["13570942901452934035"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/00207713-52-6-2101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kws2vKqsVbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 11, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
