Maximum lipid concentrations usually occurred in samples collected in December and January and corresponded with increased algal biomass. Polar lipids were the dominant lipid class. Both lipid profiles and microscopic observations showed significant variation in biomass and community structure in the water column both intra- and interannually. During the period of diatom blooms (predominantly Nitzschia spp.) the dominant sterol and fatty acid were trans-22-dehydrocholesterol and 20:5 \u03c93, respectively, which were accompanied by a high 16:1 \u03c97c to 16:0 ratio. Very high polyunsaturated fatty acid and total lipid concentrations were measured during diatom blooms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2139217048587159169", "cites_id": ["2139217048587159169"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030442039500047U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gUZ_VpIGsB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 10, "1999": 9, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
