An analysis of the fatty acid composition of the polar lipids documented the presence of methoxy, cyclopropyl, monounsaturated and hydroxycyclopropyl fatty acids of sufficiently unusual structure to serve as \u2018signatures\u2019 for the presence of these organisms in environmental samples. The structures of the unusual fatty acids of the polar lipids were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) after isolation by capillary gas chromatography (GC)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9261892524457398840", "cites_id": ["9261892524457398840"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/2/2/67/547768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OBIh7C3aiIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
