The corrosion rate, estimated as the corrosion CD (Icorr), calculated from the Tafel constants and polarization resistance, increased from 230 to 2900 nA/cm2 during a 6-day incubation period with V. natriegens. Just before the rapid increase in the corrosion CD, bacterial cells were seen by epifluorescent microscopy after acridine orange staining to colonize the SS surface. On the third day of exposure to seawater, the rapid increase in the corrosion CD correlated with the appearance of extracellular material from the colonizing bacteria, as observed by (1) epifluorescent microscopy, (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and (3) nondestructive analysis of lyophilized biofilms by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "bzPBedgAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3221517973570889679,17204554730749740265", "cites_id": ["3221517973570889679", "17204554730749740265"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/corrosion/article-abstract/42/4/204/160081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z6c6VIchtSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 5, "1989": 5, "1990": 3, "1991": 7, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
