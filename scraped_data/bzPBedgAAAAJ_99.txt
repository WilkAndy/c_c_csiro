Samples were taken 4, 2, and 0 days before each culture reached peak biomass (T\u22124, T\u22122, and Tp, respectively). Twenty sterols, 13 of which were identified, were detected. Predominant were cholest-5-en-3\u03b2-ol, 24-ethylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, 24-methylcholesta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, and 2 coeluting sterols, one of which was 24-ethylcholesta-5,7,22-trien-3\u03b2-ol. These 4 sterols comprised 50% to 90% of total sterols. Cultures grown at high DO had simpler sterol profiles than those grown at low DO. Only the 4 sterols mentioned above were present at more than 3% of total sterols in high-DO cultures. In low-DO cultures, up to 6 additional sterols were present at more than 3% of total sterols.
