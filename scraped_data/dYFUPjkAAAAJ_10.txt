We investigate a series of inundation events which occurred across the western Pacific over several consecutive days during December 2008, causing severe impacts to five Pacific Island nations. These events were not associated with commonly identified causes: tropical cyclones or unusually large astronomical tides. Instead, the dissipation of wind-waves generated by distant extra-tropical cyclones (swell) was the main cause, although regional sea level variability, including recent accelerated rise, significantly contributed to the severity of impact experienced at many locations. The implication of recent sea level rise in the severity of these events suggests that episodic swell will increasingly cause major impacts of the nature described herein, although \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 250, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14203844189771765270", "cites_id": ["14203844189771765270"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818113001483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FpZXEAkxHsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 18, "2015": 22, "2016": 21, "2017": 30, "2018": 24, "2019": 30, "2020": 33, "2021": 37, "2022": 18, "2023": 12}}
