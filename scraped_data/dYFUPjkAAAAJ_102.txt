Froude number calculations are performed on a numerically simulated event to determine the blocking capacity of the mountains while the separate roles of the southern and eastern topography are explored through a series of idealized topography simulations. It is found that the topography along the southern coastline plays a crucial role in the formation of the southerly buster through blocking of the cold air and subsequent channeling around to the east coast where the southerly surge occurs.The interaction of four other summertime cold fronts with the southeastern Australian topography is studied. Only two of these events in reality produced southerly busters on the east coast.
