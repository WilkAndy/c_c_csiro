These changes could modify sediment transport in the littoral zone and impact the coastline position. Thirty\u2010year hindcasts of winds, coastal currents and waves are shown to agree well with available observations and provide a long\u2010term dataset of the climate variability. Hindcasts of coastal ocean currents and waves indicate that while the annual net mean wave and current transport are in opposing directions, their seasonal adjusted monthly anomalies are positively correlated. Furthermore they are also correlated with the position of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9342455451719416112", "cites_id": ["9342455451719416112"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MLmlIbwRp4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3}}
