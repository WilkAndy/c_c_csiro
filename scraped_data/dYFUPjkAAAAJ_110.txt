Global-scale estimates of increases to coastal impacts have been typically attributed to sea level rise and not specifically to changes to waves on their own. This study provides a reduced complexity method for applying projected extreme wave changes to local scale impact studies. We use non-stationary extreme value analysis to distil an incremental change signal in extreme wave heights and associate this with a change in the frequency of events globally. Extreme wave heights are not projected to increase everywhere. We find that the largest increases will typically be experienced at higher latitudes, and that there is high ensemble model agreement on an increase (doubling of events) for the waters south of Australia, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7297642478962707508", "cites_id": ["7297642478962707508"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-021-87358-w.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NIxfiCtvRmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 7}}
