Increases in mean sea level and the frequency and/or intensity of severe storm events can increase the rate of offshore sediment transfer while changes in wind direction and hence wave direction can change the longshore transport of sediments causing erosion along some parts of the shoreline. The aim of this study is to investigate how the variables responsible for coastal erosion may change as a result of climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect for 2030 and 2070 planning horizons. In particular we investigate changes to wind and wave climate, storm surges, and the regional variations in mean sea level rise. An important aspect of this study is the consideration of the uncertainty of climate model responses for the relevant model variables."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18126397076249510556", "cites_id": ["18126397076249510556"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/2007/mcinneskl_f.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nAKIYxrmjfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
