Over the past two centuries, substantial progress in our understanding of the seabed and environmental conditions has been made by studies of seabed sedimentology, hydrodynamics, and habitat mapping. As part of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)\u201cWealth from Oceans\u201d flagship program, we have been involved in a five year study to investigate and predict the effect of possible climate change scenarios on the seabed over the next 50 yr. As an initial phase of this project we have taken the southeast region of the Australian seabed as our study area. The seabed responses to current climate and possible future climatic conditions over the next 50 yr have been simulated for the first time by a state-of-the-art \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5625225669825505688", "cites_id": ["5625225669825505688"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/580/chapter-standard/3803550/Predicting-seabed-change-as-a-function-of-climate", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mKlbZ_HQEE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1}}
