A total of nine summertime fronts is studied with the research version of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's operational numerical weather prediction model. In each case it is shown that the simulations produce a well-defined frontal trough at the current operational resolution of 150 km, though in all cases the simulated movement lagged that in the atmosphere. Model statistics such as skill scores and rms errors have a large degree of spatial organization and tend to be associated with errors in frontal speed more than with poor representation of frontal structure. Increasing model resolution to 50 km produces an improved frontal structure but does not significantly alter the simulation of frontal position.
