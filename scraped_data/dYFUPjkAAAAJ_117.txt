It is estimated that currently, over 150 million people live within 1 metres of the high tide (Church et al., 2007).As coastal communities increase in size, their exposure to extreme sea level events increases. Combined with the increase in frequency and or intensity of the hazard itself, as the climate changes, there is an urgent need to evaluate the likely future threat from sea level extremes. In doing so, coastal communities can assess their vulnerability, their adaptation options and implement appropriate management strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12615469414498638277", "cites_id": ["12615469414498638277"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kathleen-Mcinnes/publication/253421233_Assessing_the_Imp_act_of_Cli_mate_Change_on_Storm_Surges_in_Southern_Australia/links/00b4952f987578fa04000000/Assessing-the-Imp-act-of-Cli-mate-Change-on-Storm-Surges-in-Southern-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xRn_xZcmE68J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
