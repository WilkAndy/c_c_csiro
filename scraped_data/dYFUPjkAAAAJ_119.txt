The projections are consistent with those developed for the National Resource Management Project, available at http://www. climatechangeinaustralia. gov. au/en/climate-projections/coastal-marine/marineexplorer/(see also McInnes et al., 2015) and the IPCC (Church et al., 2013a, b) but have been developed here for all coastal councils in Australia and contain projections at decadal time intervals up to 2100.Sea levels change on a broad range of time and space scales. These time-scales range from seconds for surface waves, to hours/days for tides and storm surges, days/months/years/decades and longer for regional variability, seasonal variations, natural climate variability and the response to anthropogenic climate change. On a global scale, anthropogenic climate change is causing an increase in the volume of the ocean (and a rise in global mean sea level; Figure 1) through the expansion of ocean waters as they warm and an increase in mass of the ocean as glaciers and ice sheets lose mass (Church et al., 2013a). The mass of the ocean also changes as water is exchanged with terrestrial environment from the impacts of climate variability and change and through anthropogenic activities such as the storage of water in reservoirs and the depletion of groundwater (which subsequently makes its way to the ocean)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11670821376904951225", "cites_id": ["11670821376904951225"], "pub_url": "https://coastadapt.com.au/sites/default/files/factsheets/DSG1_1_CSIRO_guidelines_SLR.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uXV0JzUW96EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
