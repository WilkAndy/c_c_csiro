This decrease is unexplained and the resultant problem of reduced water storage has been compounded by the lack of any useful predictive skill at the seasonal time scale. This study uses recent gridded, historical data and simple linear correlation in order to evaluate the importance of links between rainfall and both mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and sea\u2010surface temperature (SST) patterns over the Indian Ocean.The decrease in rainfall is linked to decreases in the density of low\u2010pressure systems in the region and to increases in both MSLP and SST over the southern Indian Ocean. Warmer SSTs and increases in MSLP are associated with the observed long\u2010term changes, but changes in these variables do not explain a great deal of the observed interannual variability.Greenhouse\u2010induced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 211, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7142217679133464201", "cites_id": ["7142217679133464201"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0088(200012)20:15%3C1913::AID-JOC594%3E3.0.CO;2-J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:idZDWSNBHmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 16, "2007": 22, "2008": 11, "2009": 18, "2010": 16, "2011": 5, "2012": 15, "2013": 15, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
