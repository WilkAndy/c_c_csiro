Falling water levels in this region have been observed since the late 1960\u2019s with associated impacts on irrigators and possibly the wider community through potential land subsidence. The \u201cHatton Report\u201d conducted by the CSIRO Wealth From Oceans Flagship program (Hatton et. al., 2004) concluded that these fluid extraction activities have geographically variable impact on the Latrobe Aquifer water levels. The Hatton report noted community concern regarding the related risk of coastal subsidence and inundation stemming from subsidence measurements at the Latrobe Coal Mines and a series of studies of subsidence risk in the Gippsland coast by SKM (Sinclair Knight Merz (2001a, b&c)). Limited rock property data and pore pressure depletion data was used in these studies. In an effort to reduce the resulting uncertainty and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15610926753869528254", "cites_id": ["15610926753869528254"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jim-Underschultz/publication/320099408_Simulation_of_coastal_subsidence_and_storm_wave_inundation_risk_in_the_Gippsland_Basin/links/59cdca84458515cc6aa4c36f/Simulation-of-coastal-subsidence-and-storm-wave-inundation-risk-in-the-Gippsland-Basin.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vvwIIywnpdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
