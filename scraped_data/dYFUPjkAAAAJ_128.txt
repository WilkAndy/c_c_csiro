An understanding of the degree to which extreme rain and wind events overlap is required if effective flood plain modelling is to be carried out. Furthermore, knowledge of the possible future changes in the nature of extreme rain and wind events and their coincidence is necessary for longterm flood plain management.This report presents results from the first stage of a project undertaken for the Gold Coast City Council to investigate the incidence and overlap of extreme rainfall and wind events over southeast Queensland and examine how such events may vary under future global warming. Results focus on extreme rainfall events over south-east Queensland in the observational records, extreme winds over the adjacent ocean in gridded re-analysis data sets, the synoptic weather conditions associated with the extreme events and the degree to which wind and rain events coincide."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13381157839752101862", "cites_id": ["13381157839752101862"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/abbs_2004c.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5n_bqShss7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
