It builds on two previous studies. The first of these considered the effect of climate change on the wind and weather patterns responsible for storm surges in this region. The second established return levels for storm tide heights along the eastern Victorian coastline. This study builds upon the previous studies by improving the techniques for establishing sea level return levels along the eastern Victorian coastline and secondly by producing downscaled results for Corner Inlet and the northern Gippsland Lakes through hydrodynamic modelling at higher spatial resolution. It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide a basis for assessing the impact of climate driven changes in extreme sea levels on the geomorphology and physical assets of the Gippsland Coast."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14578346480696360155", "cites_id": ["14578346480696360155"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39971002/Climate_Change_in_Eastern_Victoria20151113-30676-16n8gee.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2_x4guKwUMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
