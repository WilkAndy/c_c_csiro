The storm surge model, which features a nesting capability and inundation algorithm, is described. The flooding and draining rate is dependent on the modelled current in adjacent 'wet' grid cells which ensures realistic and smoothly varying results. Model simulations are carried out in two distinctly different geographic regions. The first of these is the town of Port Hedland on the northwest coast of Australia which was severely inundated by a tropical cyclone-induced storm surge in 1939. The model is shown to reproduce the peak flood levels and areas of inundation to a high degree of accuracy. Storm surge heights at the coast produced by a 'fixed-coastline' version of the model are compared with the inundation model results and indicate an overestimation of the storm surge heights by up to 17 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 202, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15301446203920652571", "cites_id": ["15301446203920652571"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/4298925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G5lwfkCoWdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 8, "2005": 11, "2006": 13, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 13, "2010": 10, "2011": 9, "2012": 14, "2013": 8, "2014": 13, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 14, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
