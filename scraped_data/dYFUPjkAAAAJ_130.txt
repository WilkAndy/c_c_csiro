There is potential for communities and assets along the eastern coastline to increasingly come under threat from a range of climate change driven impacts. These include coastal flooding and erosion due to rising mean sea levels and possible changes in weather patterns which drive changes in wave climate and sea level extremes such as storm surges. Coastal erosion can occur in response to several factors. Increases in mean sea level, and the frequency and/or intensity of storms can increase the cross-shore transfer of sediment, while changes in wave direction in response to shifting storm patterns can alter the along-shore transfer of sediment, causing horizontal shifts in the shoreline position observed as erosion/accretion.Sea level rise, and to a lesser degree the contribution of changing storm patterns to storm surges, has received an increased amount of attention along the Australian coast over recent years (Hardy et al, 2004, Church et al., 2006, McInnes et al., 2009). However to date only minimal consideration has been given to how the surface wave climate along the eastern Australian coast will vary under projected climate conditions (McInnes et al, 2007). The aim of this study is to provide more rigorous projections of the offshore ocean wave climate of the eastern Australian continental margin, to provide a suitable dataset which can be used to assess the possible \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17742004566739076227", "cites_id": ["17742004566739076227"], "pub_url": "http://www.waveworkshop.org/11thWaves/Papers/hemeretal_EAusProj_wavesworkshop09.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g0TX-yZDOPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1}}
