During La Ni\u00f1a seasons, cyclones are found to travel along more southerly tracks and more from a westerly direction than the more frequent northwesterly tracks during the El Ni\u00f1o and neutral seasons. The statistical model was used to generate synthetic cyclones of varying intensity and track. An analytical cyclone model was used to develop 10 m wind and pressure fields for each cyclone track and a hydrodynamic model simulated the resultant storm surge response around Fiji. Storm surges were found to be higher on the northwest coasts of both the southern and northern main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu respectively.
