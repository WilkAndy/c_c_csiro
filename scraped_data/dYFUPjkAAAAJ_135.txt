Climate variability is one such issue that is impacted by, and impacts on, several other areas (e.g. coastal processes, infrastructure, health and regional economies). These interdependencies create challenges for local governments to scale-up so as to tackle these issues at a regional scale. Critical to this process of scaling-up is the adaptive capacity of local governments. A method to assist local governments deal with climate variability in the Sydney region is being developed by CSIRO and the Sydney Coastal Councils Group through the Australian Greenhouse Office National Climate Change Adaptation Program. The method consists of: (i) creating vulnerability mapping templates; (ii) working with local governments to determine collective and local vulnerabilities; (iii \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3706958711262002255", "cites_id": ["3706958711262002255"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26481566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T7zPvU7DcTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
