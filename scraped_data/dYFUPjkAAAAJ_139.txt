These data provide a basis for estimating the impact of rising sea levels on the extreme sea-level return periods and of estimating land at risk from inundation due to projected future sea levels.Tide-gauge records show that storm surges on the southeast coast of Tasmania attain maximum heights of typically less than a metre and the weather systems most commonly responsible for generating elevated sea levels at these locations are the west to east moving cold frontal systems associated with low pressure centres situated to the south of Tasmania. While such systems were also the cause of elevated sea levels on the Tasmanian north coast, the largest storm-surge events there occurred when a low pressure centre was situated to the west of Tasmania or Bass Strait and brought strong northerly winds to this coastline.The high correlation between storm surges on the Tasmanian and Victorian coasts meant that a more efficient modelling approach, previously applied to the Victorian coast, could be used to evaluate storm-surge return levels for the Tasmanian coast. In this, a population of extreme sea-level generating weather events was identified from a limited number of long tide-gauge records and each of the events modelled with a hydrodynamic model forced with archived wind and pressure patterns. The peak residual sea levels from each event were then statistically analysed to obtain event probabilities. This modelling indicated that the highest storm-surges \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=42027946711454324", "cites_id": ["42027946711454324"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/94740/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dBJg4jFQlQAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
