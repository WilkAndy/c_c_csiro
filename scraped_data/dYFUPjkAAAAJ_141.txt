This integrated assessment project is focused on climate vulnerability in the Sydney coastal region and the adaptive capacity of SCCG Member Councils to address regional climate change adaptation issues. The project explores themes of systems approaches to climate vulnerability, the need for integration, participation of stakeholders, and partnering for science impact.The project will yield substantial benefits including the understanding of the potential for adaptive management strategies and the barriers and opportunities associated with implementation among Local Governments. In this paper the Project Team presents the project methodologies, and preliminary results and lessons learned from the first two project phases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1528053794791655657", "cites_id": ["1528053794791655657"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=773d91b974c253c4e9ceb411191031ca582c20ae", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6Yg-lNS8NBUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
