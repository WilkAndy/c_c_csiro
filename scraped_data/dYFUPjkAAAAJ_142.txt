A systems approach to coastal research andmanagement consists of:(i) identifying the underlying drivers of change and potential management leverage points for maximum impact;(ii) development of potential strategies for ecosystem-based management;(iii) evaluation of the consequences of potential solutions and comparing solution outcomes; and (iv) reflecting on potential short-and long-term implications of potential management strategies. This paper presents examples of systems approaches to coastal research and management, and describes the potential application of a systems approach to the Sydney region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3168754246561408680", "cites_id": ["3168754246561408680"], "pub_url": "https://research.usc.edu.au/esploro/outputs/conferencePresentation/A-Systems-Approach-to-Coastal-Research-and-Management/99450238202621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qKbNzjKt-SsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
