Some progress has been made on the incorporation of these results into practical planning recommendations for urban infrastructure (for a recent summary, see Walsh et al.[2002]). Predictions of global mean sea level rise can be made with more confidence than many other aspects of climate change science. Even so, there are significant uncertainties regarding these predictions. While not all coastal municipalities include sea level rise in their planning schemes, the recent adoption in a number of States of new planning schemes with statutory authority creates a changed planning environment for local government. For local planning, ideally a risk assessment methodology may be employed to estimate the risk caused by sea level rise. In many locations, planning thresholds would also have to be considered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13625592589224373065", "cites_id": ["13625592589224373065"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13625592589224373065&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SevptkTUF70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 1}}
