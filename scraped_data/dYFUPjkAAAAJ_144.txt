Consequently it also has the potential to change both the frequency and the severity of flooding. The extent of this change is dependent on the nature of the event and of the geographic location. This paper describes the development of a prototype integrated modelling system that may be used to examine the effect of extreme rainfall events on urban areas. The modelling system entails coupling a high-resolution atmospheric model with a non-linear flood event model suitable for use in urban areas. By integrating these modelling tools with a Geographic Information System, the physical modelling results can be transferred into relevant frameworks for applications to a range of problems in urban areas. An example for a past flood is used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8977691506822824559", "cites_id": ["8977691506822824559"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.573611315607573", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b0I3D9wql3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
