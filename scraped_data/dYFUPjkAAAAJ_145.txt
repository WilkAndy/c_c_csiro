SLR projections based on climate models support policy analysis, risk assessment and adaptation planning today, despite their large uncertainties. The central range of the SLR distribution is estimated by process\u2010based models. However, risk\u2010averse practitioners often require information about plausible future conditions that lie in the tails of the SLR distribution, which are poorly defined by existing models. Here, a community effort combining scientists and practitioners builds on a framework of discussing physical evidence to quantify high\u2010end global SLR for practitioners. The approach is complementary to the IPCC AR6 report and provides further physically plausible high\u2010end scenarios.
