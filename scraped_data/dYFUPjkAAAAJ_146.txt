Analysis of Global Climate Model (GCM) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations has shown that Lakes Entrance, a township located at the northern end of Ninety Mile Beach in south-eastern Australia, is situated in a region that may experience noticeable future changes in longshore winds, waves and coastal currents, which could alter the supply of sediments to the shoreline. This paper will demonstrate a downscaling procedure for using the data from GCM and RCM simulations to force a local climate model (LCM) at the beach scale to simulate additional nearshore wind-wave, hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes to estimate future changes. Two types of sediment transport models were used in this study, the simple empirical coastline-type model (CERC equation), and a detailed numerical coastal area-type model (TELEMAC). The two models resolved transport in very different ways, but nevertheless came to similar conclusions on the annual net longshore sediment transport rate. The TELEMAC model, with the Soulsby-Van Rijn formulation, showed the importance of the contribution of storm events to transport. The CERC equation estimates more transport during the period between storms than TELEMAC. The TELEMAC modelled waves, hydrodynamics and bed-evolutions are shown to agree well with the available observations. A new method is introduced to downscale GCM longshore \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11330414317914916873", "cites_id": ["11330414317914916873"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/521920", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CYhRgcq3PZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
