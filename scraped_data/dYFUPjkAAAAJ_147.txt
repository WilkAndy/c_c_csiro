Extreme sea levels analysed in global tide gauge data sets have also exhibited positive trends that are largely consistent with mean sea level trends (Woodworth and Blackman 2004; Menendez and Woodworth 2011). Rising sea levels will be felt most acutely during the coincidence of high tides and severe storm events when strong winds and lower-than-normal atmospheric pressure cause storm surges and high waves. Such events can lead to inundation of low lying coastal terrain, severe erosion and wave overtopping.Global averaged sea levels are projected to increase by 18 to 79 cm by 2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 due to thermal expansion of the oceans, the melting of glaciers and ice sheets and an additional allowance for a potential rapid future increase in the dynamic ice sheet contribution to sea levels although it is emphasised that this contribution is highly uncertain and larger values cannot be excluded (IPCC 2007)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2070192428955430220", "cites_id": ["2070192428955430220"], "pub_url": "https://www.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/125151/CSIRO-Inundation-Modelling_1Dec2011.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TG2XuAvNuhwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
