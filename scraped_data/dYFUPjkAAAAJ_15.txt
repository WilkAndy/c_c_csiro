The 10 m winds from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 multi\u2010model ensemble are assessed against reanalysis winds and found to exhibit lowest skill over land areas. Maps of future change in mean wind speed, direction and 99th percentile wind speed are presented to convey spatial information as well as the multi\u2010model agreement on sign and magnitude of the change. The utility of these maps in providing context for the design of more detailed impact studies, for which wind is a required input, is discussed.
