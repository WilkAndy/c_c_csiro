Despite growing awareness of climate change impacts on the coastal zone, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude and significance of these impacts. Although, the coastal zone is the most densely settled area of New South Wales and represents the peak economic margin, a systematic study of all climate change impacts affecting the NSW coastline and estuaries has not been undertaken to date. The costs associated with potential coastal erosion, inundation, and the degradation of estuaries due to climate change impacts cannot be evaluated in the absence of such a systematic study. This study takes an initial step towards addressing this knowledge gap by quantifying the range of climate change driven environmental and socio-economic impacts, with a view to developing appropriate adaptation measures at two representative locations in coastal NSW: Batemans Bay and Wooli Wooli River."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4571458686283259354", "cites_id": ["4571458686283259354"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Hanslow/publication/267508050_Climate_Change_impacts_on_NSW_coasts_and_estuaries/links/5fa8cf6692851cc286a06517/Climate-Change-impacts-on-NSW-coasts-and-estuaries.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2p1JXXQVcT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
