Statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) and zonal wave energy flux (CgE) are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by blocking at 140\u00b0 E. Strong negative anomalies in these wave fields highlight the role of blocking in promoting calm wave conditions around the Australian coast. A relatively weak but notable remote signal also appears in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, suggesting a link to the Australian region via tropical forcing. The occurrence of daily low (below the 5th percentile) and high (above the 95th percentile) wave conditions also varies contemporaneously with blocking at 140\u00b0 E.
