The updated values are consistent with those developed for the National Resource Management Project, available at http://www. climatechangeinaustralia. gov. au/en/climate-projections/coastal-marine/marine-explorer/(see also McInnes et al., 2015) and the IPCC (Church et al., 2013a, b) and the NCCARF CoastAdapt web portal. The information presented here has been adapted to the requirements of the Tasmanian Department of Premier and Cabinet by adjusting the values to a reference year of 2010 (as opposed to the 1986-2005 average used by the IPCC, NRM and McInnes et al, 2015). The results presented here update a previous assessment undertaken by the Tasmanian Climate Change Office (2012) to provide sea-level projections and water level allowances based on the IPCC Fourth Assessment report (AR4)(IPCC, 2007). The report also provides information to aid in the interpretation and use of the sea-level rise projections and allowances data sets.Information on extreme sea-level likelihoods is necessary for the assessment of exposure and vulnerability from rising sea levels due to global warming. Assessments of exposure and vulnerability are commonly generated from flood mapping using hydrodynamic and/or wave models (Hoeke et al, 2015) or Geographic Information Systems (eg Department of Climate Change, 2009, Lacey et al, 2015) or a combination of both (McInnes et al, 2012a, 2013). The common practice is to investigate flooding from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8002072602572410885", "cites_id": ["8002072602572410885"], "pub_url": "https://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/64420/CSIRO_Sea_Level_Rise_Allowance_Report_December_2016.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BdA2n6ISDW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
