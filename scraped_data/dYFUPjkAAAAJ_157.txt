Assessments of potential impacts of climate change in the coastal zone have to date focussed largely on the influence of sea level rise, and this focus must be broadened to include a larger range of coastal processes in future (Nicholls et al., 2007). While there have been considerable advances in determining the potential impacts of climate change driven inundation in the coastal zone over recent decades, Christensen et al.(2007) recognised that there was insufficient information on how climate change will influence waves or near-shore coastal currents to make an assessment of the potential influence of climate change on coastal erosion. The aims of this study are to determine how available projected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7420234030258943809", "cites_id": ["7420234030258943809"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP105033&sb=RECENT&n=33&rpp=50&page=25&tr=5486&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QXfZU4n3-WYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
