Included are scores of low-lying islands and atolls, many no more than a few metres above sea level. Even for mountainous islands, the inhabitable land tends to lie on the coastal fringe and so, too, is at risk from sea-level rise. Coastal wetlands, major river deltas, sandy beach and dune systems, mangroves and coral reef systems are also potentially threatened (Bijlsma, 1996; Nurse et al., 1998). Internationally, the enhanced vulnerability of coastal zones to climate change and sea-level rise, especially in relation to the needs of small-island developing states, has been explicitly recognised by the Climate Convention (Article 4.8; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 1992) and Agenda 21 (1992).The implications of global warming for the resources, economic activities and human well-being in the coastal zone are far-reaching. Changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, for example, could affect the quantity and quality of available groundwater supplies, agricultural activities and human health in the coastal zone."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4078267661207163565,8909636652845444579", "cites_id": ["4078267661207163565", "8909636652845444579"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NnpcBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT274&dq=info:rVI3jdTqmDgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=dM1mfFlnJ2&sig=vN8d1g-T0vkE_dImafyCDFqgmIY", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rVI3jdTqmDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
