Predictions of global mean sea level rise can be made with more confidence than many other aspects of climate change science. The world has warmed in the past century, and as a result global mean sea level has risen and is expected to continue to rise. Even so, there are significant uncertainties regarding predictions of sea level. These arise from two main sources: the future amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the ability of models to predict the impact of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.Current knowledge regarding the effect of global warming on sea level rise is reviewed. Global mean sea level is expected to rise by 3\u201330 cm by 2040, and 9\u201388 cm by 2100. An important remaining uncertainty is the future contribution of surface water storage (for example, lakes and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13800708549124477554", "cites_id": ["13800708549124477554"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jcr/article-abstract/20/2%20(202)/586/216013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ctJCX073hb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 12, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 18, "2013": 19, "2014": 9, "2015": 15, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
