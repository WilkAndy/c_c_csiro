This is to provide relevant information for the Samoan Parliament Complex Redevelopment Project (SPCRP) that is being supported through a partnership between the Government of Australia and the Government of Samoa. The location for the Parliament redevelopment is towards the northern end of the Mulinu\u2019u Peninsula (Fig. 1). A number of studies have identified the peninsula\u2019s vulnerability to storm surge inundation (eg Hay and Hartley, 2013), particularly under projected future sea level rise. Hay and Hartley (2013) recommended a detailed assessment of current and projected future storm surge risk be undertaken for the Apia area.As part of the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning (PACCSAP) Program, the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education (DIICCSRTE) funded the CSIRO to model the maximum water level heights and associated flow velocities for one in 20, 50, and 100-year storm surge events at the Mulinu\u2019u peninsula, Apia, and surrounding urban regions for present day conditions as well as those projected for 2030, 2055 and 2090."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1821341084721885912", "cites_id": ["1821341084721885912"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=138499cac51bda227c09f9428b16a462be70671d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2DKsERG0RhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
