Projections of future sea level rise are for even higher rates of rise over the course of this Century. Extreme sea levels evaluated for different return periods for Victoria exhibit considerable variation along the coast due to the large spatial variation in tides as well as storm surge. Under future scenarios of sea level rise, the potential inundation from such events may increase non-linearly for many locations, particularly urban areas. Information on changes in other variables and processes that influence the coast such as wave climate and coastal erosion are currently limited for reasons which include: uncertainties in projected future climate change; constraints at the process understanding level; lack of observations; the need for significant computational resources to simulate processes at the localized scales over which these variables and processes occur.. Further research is needed to refine future estimates of climate change and address such knowledge gaps. However, recent studies indicate that significant progress on identifying and prioritizing adaptation options for future climate change can progress despite these limitations and uncertainties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5673064751899418942", "cites_id": ["5673064751899418942"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Khairulmaini-Osman-Salleh/publication/283117127_Climate_Change_Threat_and_Low_Income_Populations_of_Coastal_Zones/links/562b902408ae22b170336f68/Climate-Change-Threat-and-Low-Income-Populations-of-Coastal-Zones.pdf#page=11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PiHBrFXGuk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
