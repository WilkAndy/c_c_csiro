However, given the complexity of the interactions between climate and society, a broad range of pathways exist by which community vulnerability can be increased or reduced. Engagement tools that can assist in communicating this complexity to stakeholders are therefore useful for expanding the portfolio of management options available to local government and insuring against adverse externalities in decision-making.A vulnerability mapping exercise was undertaken in the metropolitan Sydney region to facilitate engagement with fifteen coastal local government areas regarding potential vulnerability to climate change and the barriers and opportunities associated with climate adaptation. Vulnerability was assessed across five impact areas: sea-level rise and coastal hazards, heat-related health effects, extreme rainfall and stormwater management, bushfire, and degradation of natural ecosystems and assets. Spatial estimates of relative vulnerability were determined through the integration of multiple vulnerability indicators within a geographic information system. Results reflected the high degree of spatial heterogeneity that exists with respect to climate vulnerability as well as the importance of demographic and socio-economic conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8855309359371327055", "cites_id": ["8855309359371327055"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin-Preston/publication/252633518_CLIMATE_CHANGE_VULNERABILITY_MAPPING_AS_A_STAKEHOLDER_ENGAGEMENT_TOOL_CASE_STUDY_FROM_SYDNEY_AUSTRALIA/links/02e7e53baa8a8e9cc2000000/CLIMATE-CHANGE-VULNERABILITY-MAPPING-AS-A-STAKEHOLDER-ENGAGEMENT-TOOL-CASE-STUDY-FROM-SYDNEY-AUSTRALIA.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TxaF5fFg5HoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
