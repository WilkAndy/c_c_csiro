Two study locations, the Wooli Wooli River system and the Clyde River/Batemans Bay system, have been selected. It is expected that the study of these two very different estuary systems will facilitate the assessment of the impacts of climate change on other estuaries on the NSW coast.This report draws on existing literature to provide information on changes in climate variables likely to impact the Wooli Wooli Estuary and Batemans Bay for the 2030 and 2070 planning horizons. It complements a report by McInnes et al.(2007) describing projected changes in environmental variables that influence coastal erosion for the same two locations and planning horizons."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7505493533255788181", "cites_id": ["7505493533255788181"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/2007/macadami_b.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:leazSZreKGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3}}
