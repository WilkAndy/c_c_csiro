Model problems are exacerbated in the polar regions by Measurements of the mean and turbulence structure of the the complicated vertical structure of the Arctic boundary boundary layer along with cloud microphysical and layer. The presence of multiple cloud layers, a humidity radiative properties were obtained from the National inversion above cloud top, and vertical fluxes in the cloud Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Electra; details that are decoupled from the surface fluxes, identified in of these measurements may be found in Tsay and Curry et al.(1988), suggest that models containing Jayaweera (1983), Herman and Curry (1984), Curry and sophisticated physical parameterizations would be required Herman (1995), Curry (1986), and Curry et al.(1988). to accurately model this region. Accurate modeling of the vertical structure of multiple cloud layers in climate The synoptic situation on June 28, 1980, consisted of a models is important for determination of the surface mature anticyclone centered over the Beaufort Sea.
