CSIRO Data61 has developed the City Flood Adaptation Solutions Tool (C-FAST) which allows incorporation of modular flood adaptation solutions to climate change such as seawalls and retention/detention systems as well as an interactive graphic user interface to enable coastal planners and engineers to run inundation simulations at the local scale for their coastlines. This paper will detail and demonstrate the implementation of wave overtopping parameterisation (EurOtop) in the C-FAST model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4754750083608569216", "cites_id": ["4754750083608569216"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.800403617718164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gGU_YQJE_EEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
