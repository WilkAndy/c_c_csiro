Here we analyze the first global survey on the use of SLR projections comprising 253 coastal practitioners engaged in adaptation/planning from 49 countries with time frames of 2050 and 2100. While recognition of the threat of SLR is almost universally recognized, only 71% of respondents currently utilize SLR projections. Generally, developing countries have lower levels of utilization. There is no global standard in the use of SLR projections: for locations using a standard structure, 53% are planning for a single projection, while the remainder are using multiple projections, with 13% considering an unlikely high-end scenario. Countries with long histories of adaptation and consistent national support show greater assimilation of SLR projections into adaptation decisions. This research proves insightful for improving sea-level science, and informs important ongoing efforts on the application of the science which are essential to promote effective adaptation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11944125535775148826", "cites_id": ["11944125535775148826"], "pub_url": "https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/all_datasets/198/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
