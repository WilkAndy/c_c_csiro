In addition to providing underpinning climate data, climate services may also provide guidance on how to use climate data in decision making as well as tools that deliver data to inform decision making. Services that relate to the coastal and marine sector are emerging but are generally less advanced than climate services in general (Le Cozannet et al., 2017).Within the Earth Systems and Climate Change (ESCC) Hub, it is timely to undertake a review of coastal and marine services. The findings of this review have not only informed the ongoing work under Project 5.8 but are also of relevance to Project 5.3 in developing recommendations for the Next Generation climate projections for the Australian region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1047336016436984686", "cites_id": ["1047336016436984686"], "pub_url": "https://nespclimate.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ESCC_Coastal-climate-services_Report-18-.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bvsy1I7iiA4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
