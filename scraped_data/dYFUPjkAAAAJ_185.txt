This support relates to the provision of information and model simulations of coastal sea levels along the Nadi coastline during tropical cyclones (TCs) at spatial resolutions that can inform detailed floodplain modelling.Of the various types of weather systems that cause severe rainfall and flooding, TCs are particularly hazardous because of their potential to elevate coastal sea levels due to storm surges and high waves. In addition to causing flooding of low-lying coastal terrain, higher coastal sea levels during a storm surge can slow the drainage of floodwater from coastal river systems to the ocean. This in turn may worsen the severity and extent of coastal and upstream flooding by a process that is referred to as the \u2018backwater\u2019effect."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1870831997852631381", "cites_id": ["1870831997852631381"], "pub_url": "https://terranova.org.au/repository/paccsap-collection/tropical-cyclone-storm-tides-in-nadi-bay-fiji-technical-report/storm-tide-risk-assessment-and-high-resolution.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VcFwOsqH9hkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
