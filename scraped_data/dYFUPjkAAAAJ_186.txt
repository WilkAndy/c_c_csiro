However, to date only minimal consideration has been given to how the surface wave climate will respond to projected climate conditions. The aim of this study is to provide projections of the surface ocean wave climate along the eastern Australian continental margin, to provide a suitable dataset which will aid assessment of the possible effects of climate change on coastal erosion in the region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2571872194568466524", "cites_id": ["2571872194568466524"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=dfd12a27c9b284deec574b426713070e80a52fcd#page=52", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XDD1dCIgsSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
