In the coastal zone, the risk of flooding may be further increased if severe precipitation bearing weather systems also produce storm surges and high waves leading to sea level extremes. Knowledge of the weather systems that cause coincident severe rainfall and coastal sea levels and how such systems will be affected by global warming is therefore of particular relevance to those responsible for the coastal management and disaster mitigation.In the tropics, cyclones are well known to produce both rainfall and storm surges, both of which can contribute to severe coastal flooding. Notable recent examples include hurricane Katrina over the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 and typhoon Nargis over Myanmar in 2007.
