The method involves identifying a large population of storm surge events in tide gauge records along the stretch of coastline of interest and modelling each event with a hydrodynamic model. Conditions under future climate regimes are considered by perturbing the atmospheric boundary conditions of the model in accordance with wind speed projections from climate models. Extreme value analysis is applied to the output of the hydrodynamic model to generate probabilities and return periods for storm surge heights. A Monte-Carlo approach is used to combine these heights with tide heights. Finally estimates of future mean sea level rise from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are added in. Initial work on the possible impact of changes in extreme sea levels on the risk of inundation of low lying coastal land will also be presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10724252699680431410", "cites_id": ["10724252699680431410"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20963605", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mt35xQIz1JQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
