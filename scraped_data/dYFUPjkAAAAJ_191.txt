The two most common and significant classes of severe weather events responsible for storm tides in this region are tropical cyclones and mid-latitude depressions such as east coast lows. This report documents the methodology for determining storm tide levels, which combines deterministic modelling of coastal sea levels using the GEMS Coastal Ocean Model (GCOM2D) with statistical models of cyclone occurrence and east coast low occurrence. Results are obtained at the entrances to the Seaway and the Coomera River.Storm tide levels are defined as the elevation of water from mean sea level resulting from the effects of tides, winds and waves, excluding any contributions from freshwater runoff, Greenhouse warming of the oceans or changes in future storm climatologies. For the three primary locations of the study, the storm tide levels are as follows:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17145879530420005679", "cites_id": ["17145879530420005679"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/mcinnes_2000b.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L2tTFJdm8u0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
