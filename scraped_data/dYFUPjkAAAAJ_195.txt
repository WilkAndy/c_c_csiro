As in-situ bathymetric data collection is often costly and/or logistically challenging, bathymetry derived from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery has become widely used. This paper details an ongoing investigation into the suitability of using UAV captured multispectral imagery to develop a repeatable methodology to detect and measure inlet morphological variability. Specifically, this study utilises multispectral imagery to derive bathymetric models using the empirical algorithm first proposed by Stumpf et al (2003) to determine inlet variability through time.
