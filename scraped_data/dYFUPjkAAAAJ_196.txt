Here we analyze the first global survey on the use of SLR projections comprising 253 4 coastal practitioners engaged in adaptation/planning from 49 countries with time frames of 2050 5 and 2100. While recognition of the threat of SLR is almost universally recognized, only 71% of 6 respondents currently utilize SLR projections. Generally, developing countries have lower levels 7 of utilization. There is no global standard in the use of SLR projections: for locations using a 8 standard structure, 53% are planning for a single projection, while the remainder are using 9 multiple projections, with 13% considering an unlikely high-end scenario. Countries with long 10 histories of adaptation and consistent national support show greater assimilation of SLR 11 projections into adaptation decisions. This research proves insightful for improving sea-level 12 science, and informs important ongoing efforts on the application of the science which are 13 essential to promote effective adaptation. 14"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1627606/latest.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
