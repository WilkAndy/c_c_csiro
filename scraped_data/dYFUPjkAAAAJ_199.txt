However, not all cities and states have the same resources and support to prepare for distant futures. Additionally, projections of sea level rise are complex and evolving, particularly at the high end (Stammer et al., 2019). To help understand how adaptation practitioners are using evolving science in planning, an international team distributed a questionnaire to local sea level rise practitioners to better understand their use of sea level rise projections. Over 200 completed surveys were received, representing every inhabited continent. We will present the data collected, identify similarities and differences between projections in use in planning adaptation globally, and compare the planning timeframes and the origins of the science used in these projections.
