Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Australian sea-level data from the 1880s to the present, including an assessment of satellite-altimeter data since 1993. Sea levels around the Australian coast are well sampled from 1966 to the present. The first Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) of data from 16 sites around the coast explains 69% of the variance, and is closely related to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with the strongest influence on the northern and western coasts. Removing the variability in this EOF correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index reduces the differences in the trends between locations. After the influence of ENSO is removed and allowing for the impact of Glacial Isostatic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17776958670374940612", "cites_id": ["17776958670374940612"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825214000956", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xK9_brlxtPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 16, "2016": 15, "2017": 20, "2018": 13, "2019": 23, "2020": 17, "2021": 21, "2022": 18, "2023": 3}}
