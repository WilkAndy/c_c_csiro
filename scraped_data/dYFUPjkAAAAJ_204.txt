When coincided with other flood-producing mechanisms such as extreme rainfall, the consequences can be devastating. Therefore it is important to understand the interaction between extreme storm surge and extreme rainfall. Previously, the dependence between extreme storm surge and extreme rainfall in Australia has been investigated using observed data from 49 tide gauges along the Australian coastline and statistically significant dependence has been observed for the majority of the locations (Zheng et al. 2013). However, in order to assess the flood risk due to coincident extreme surge and rainfall along coastal regions, more detailed mapping (eg including locations where there is no tide gauge) of the dependence between the two flood \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.5916W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
