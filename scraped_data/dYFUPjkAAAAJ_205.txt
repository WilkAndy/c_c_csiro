In this study, we examine two historical storm-wave events, one which occurred at Sydney's northern beaches, Australia, and the other at the Coral Coast, Fiji. Both events resulted in significant damage to coastal structures. Wave energy flux from 32 years of wind wave hindcast data are used to identify extreme events and the location of these two events among them. Other variables, derived both from the hindcast and from neighbouring tide gauge data, are used to further identify storm characteristics. The findings show that the Sydney event is unique in the record, with exceptionally high wave energy flux coupled with an unusual wave direction and unusually high tides. Reasons for the severity of the Fiji event are less clear, and point to the need for further analysis to understand \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.929970039256697", "cites_per_year": {}}
