To assess coastal hazards due to storm generated waves, observations from an ongoing field campaign at Ipan, Guam of wave-driven water levels from a series of energetic typhoons during the recent El Nino event are presented. Incident conditions that produce the observed extreme shoreline water levels are assessed, and the behavior of the shoreline response to prior history is determined using analytical and numerical models. The largest observed shoreline response occurred during typhoon Dolphin and is shown to be due in part to the sustained, large breaking wave setup that provided a significant contribution to the shoreline water level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFMNH24A..04B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
