The Australia Government has made notable investments in pre-commercial wave energy developments in these areas, however little is known about how this technology may impact local wave climate and subsequently affect neighbouring coastal environments, eg altering sediment transport, causing shoreline erosion or accretion. In this study, a network of in-situ wave measurement devices have been deployed surrounding the 3 wave energy converters of the Carnegie Wave Energy Limited's Perth Wave Energy Project. This data is being used to develop, calibrate and validate numerical simulations of the project site. Early stage results will be presented and potential simulation strategies for scaling-up the findings to larger arrays of wave energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..1810943H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
