To provide the best representation of wave energy resource information, accounting for both spatial and temporal characteristics of the resource, a 34+ yr numerical hindcast of wave conditions in the Australian region has been developed. Considerable in situ and remotely sensed data have been collected to support calibration and validation of the hindcast, resulting in a high-quality characterisation of the available wave resource in the Australian domain. Planning for wave energy projects is also subject to other spatial constraints. Spatial information on alternative uses of the marine domain including, for example, fisheries and aquaculture, oil and gas, shipping, navigation and ports, marine parks and reserves, sub-sea cables and infrastructure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUOSHI54A1842H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
