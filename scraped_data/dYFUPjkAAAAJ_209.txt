Changes in time-mean regional sea level have been presented in Chapter 8. This work in this chapter explores potential changes in waves and surge activity for the Singapore region, under climate change. The results presented are based on the RCP8. 5 scenario, which is the most severe emissions scenario used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (hereafter \u201cAR5\u201d). The scientific background to changes in sea level extremes for the Singapore region has been presented in the previous Chapter 8 report. In Section 9.4. 2 of this chapter we present our recommended method to combine mean sea level projections (Chapter 8) with surge projections (this chapter) and present day extreme sea level data, to produce site-specific projections of extreme sea level for the 21st Century."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ccrs.weather.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/V2_Ch9_Extreme_Sea_Level_Projections.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LUbw7bZQ5_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
