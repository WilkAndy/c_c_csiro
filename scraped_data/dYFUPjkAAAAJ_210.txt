Broadly speaking, these drivers can be broken down into those that contribute to global and large-scale sea level rise (Section S3. 2) and those regional processes that control the most extreme sea levels, which are often linked to local meteorology (Sections S3. 3 and S3. 4). The report also provides both a motivation and context for the coastal modelling simulations that are being carried out and described in Chapter 9.Since the focus of the current report is on climatic drivers of sea level change, we will only discuss other factors that affect local vertical land movement in passing. However, of particular note for Singapore is tectonic activity associated with the Sumatra fault. Ongoing research at the Singapore Earth Observatory indicates that a major earthquake in this region could result in subsequent local subsidence and an associated sea level rise of several tens of centimetres over a number of decades (Emma Hill, personal communication)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohar-Chattopadhyay-2/publication/296332876_Key_Factors_for_Sea_Level_Rise_in_the_Singapore_Region/links/56d4944808ae9e9dea65b4db/Key-Factors-for-Sea-Level-Rise-in-the-Singapore-Region.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nmChBPdLoGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
