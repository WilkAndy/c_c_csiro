Sea level rise occurs as a result of contributions from a number of sources, including ocean thermal expansion, the addition of melt water from the world's glaciers and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Recent progress on understanding the contributions to the observed sea level rise over the twentieth century will help to narrow the uncertainty around future sea level rise projections although significant uncertainties will remain due to uncertainties around the response of the ice sheets to enhanced warming."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/684afc09cfcecccbd736ca3d813c3ebc/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1256339", "cites_per_year": {}}
