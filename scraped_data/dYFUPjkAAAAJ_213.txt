The longshore directional wave climate variability is investigated to show a decadal trend. Reasonable validation of the modelled wind and wave on the ocean side of the domain is achieved in this study, however improved hydrodynamic modelling requires improved bathymetry within the Gippsland Lakes system. Three simulations testing different components of the hydrodynamics highlight the sensitivity of the model setup to move sediments offshore during stormy conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://henry.baw.de/bitstream/20.500.11970/104308/1/08_O_Grady_2012.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:40YVlWyEeNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
