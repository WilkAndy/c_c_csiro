These data provide a basis for estimating the impact of rising sea levels on the extreme sea-level return periods and of estimating land at risk from inundation due to projected future sea levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39971038/Climate_Futures_for_Tasmania_extreme_tid20151113-31967-1v7gcbx.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DvWVZPSugPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
