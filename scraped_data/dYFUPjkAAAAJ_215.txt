Rising mean sea levels interact with hydrodynamic agents such as storm surge and waves to exacerbate coastal inundation. For example, McInnes et al.(2009) found with a projection of 0.47 m mean sea-level rise by 2070, a one in one hundred year sea level could occur every one to three years along the Victorian coastline based on modelling of extreme sea levels due to storm surges and tides.Wave setup can also contribute to coastal sea levels during storm surge events. Wave setup refers to the slope on the ocean surface at the coast arising from the shoreward transport of momentum from breaking waves in the surf zone. The magnitude of the setup is related not only to the incident wave height but also to the incident direction of waves relative to the coast (Hsu et al. 2006)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=dfd12a27c9b284deec574b426713070e80a52fcd#page=48", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OdGJKP25xqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
