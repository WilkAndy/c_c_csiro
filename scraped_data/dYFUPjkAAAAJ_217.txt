Since the late 1990\u2019s, a rapid increase in the rate of internal migration from large cities to the coast, has led to an increase in development pressure along the coast, which in turn poses challenges for sustainable management of the coast. Climate change through rising sea levels and possible changes to severe storms has the potential to create significant additional challenges to coastal management. Such issues have prompted the present study which is concerned with the evaluation of storm tides under present and future climate conditions and their possible contribution to coastal inundation.This study employs hydrodynamic models and statistical techniques to develop information on the extreme sea level hazard along Victoria\u2019s coast. These extreme sea levels usually occur as a result of the combination of tides with storm surges associated with weather systems that bring westerly winds to the south coast of Australia. In this study, extreme sea levels are estimated using an approach similar to that of McInnes et al (2009), whereby tide and surge heights are evaluated separately and then combined to estimate \u2018storm tide\u2019heights. A hydrodynamic model is used to estimate tide and surge heights for the entire Victorian coast and return periods are estimated using extreme value statistical analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b8c5462bbd808bf4bcdc092a3f0bad5de1ab98a2#page=133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cgxC77yzjvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
