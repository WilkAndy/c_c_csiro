While rising sea levels are expected to increase the rate of erosion along many coastlines, changes in atmospheric circulation that cause changes in the wave climate may also alter the sediment budget along coastlines leading to shoreline changes. The IPCC AR4 WG2 recognise the potential importance of a changing wave climate on coastal systems, but are constrained to state projected changes are uncertain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/93bc07b3a92266d21ab3e23d08551c10/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=4998669", "cites_per_year": {}}
