Therefore understanding the present risk of extreme sea level and how this will change in the future is an essential first step to identifying potential impacts at the coast. The first part of this talk describes the method used and modelling undertaken to develop spatially continuous sea level return periods along the coastline of Victoria in southeastern Australia to provide the information necessary to assess the potential impact of increases in mean sea level and changes in the meteorological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/8c90305b73ab40187f308cf1651901e7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=4998669", "cites_per_year": {}}
