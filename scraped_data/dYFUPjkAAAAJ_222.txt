Climate change adds a new dimension to the complexity of issues that need to be addressed to obtain a better understanding of the risk tropical cyclones present to society now and into the future.Rising sea levels and changing characteristics of tropical cyclones such as intensity, frequency and location of occurrence are the two key ways in which climate change will influence future tropical cyclone impacts. Of these, sea level rise carries a high certainty of occurrence even though the precise magnitude of the rise is much less certain."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bae2a40a1292cf47821c849e2d9221c98b5ad4ef#page=33", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y8TLMkoLhb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
