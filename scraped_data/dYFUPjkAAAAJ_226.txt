The investigation area covers the continental shelf and abyssal basins of the SW Region, which includes Rottnest Shelf, the Great Australian Bight, Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent, as well as parts of Western Australia and the South Australia coast. It was found that a) climate change has a significant impact on the shelf sedimentation systems; b) the majority of terrigenous sediment carried down by major rivers is trapped in the inland lakes or estuaries. Only a marginal fraction of fine grain sediment reaches the continental shelf; c) Leeuwin Current and high energy waves play the most important roles on large-scale long-term evolution of the SW \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.811974692869506", "cites_per_year": {}}
