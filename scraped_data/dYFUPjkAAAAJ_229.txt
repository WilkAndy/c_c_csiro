Extremes often result in loss of life and damage to infrastructure and environment, and knowledge of their historical, and potential future, amplitudes and frequencies determines the scale of resources required for adaptation and coastal protection. An example of a combined impact is the damage caused by the recent Katrina storm surge at New Orleans, which was compounded by the rate of local MSL rise in the Mississippi delta (as in all major deltas) of several times the global average, together with anthropogenic changes to the delta wetlands. On much longer timescales, extremes and MSL change are both major factors in determining coastal evolution including the development of coastal ecosystems.It will be seen below that, although it is difficult to determine how MSL has changed in the past and how it might change in the future and to determine the reasons for change (the main topics of this Conference), the very nature of extreme events makes a much harder task of forming an impression of how they fluctuate. And yet, for practical purposes, the study of extremes is far more important than that of MSL."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://geodesy.unr.edu/hanspeterplag/library/sealevel/2006_ioc_workshop_paris/Extremes_position_paper_11_05_06.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S6rIQ8YrYp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
