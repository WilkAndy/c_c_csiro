Climate variability is one such issue that is impacted by, and impacts on, several other areas (eg. coastal processes, infrastructure, health, and regional economies). These interdependencies create challenges for local councils to tackle these issues at a regional scale. Critical to this process of scaling-up is the adaptive capacity of local councils. In order to support local councils in the Sydney region to deal with the impacts of climate variability and change, the Sydney Coastal Councils Group, CSIRO and the University of the Sunshine Coast are undertaking an 18 month project through the Australian Greenhouse Office, National Climate Change Adaptation Program entitled \u201cSystems Approach to Regional Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Metropolises\u201d. The goal of this project is to work with local councils to determine key vulnerabilities and their capacity to adapt in order to manage these risks at a regional scale. The project approach will be tested to allow transfer to other regions throughout Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=515e0bd4ec0705f0c93edfef9975625533d95dc0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:apXebnd96bcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
