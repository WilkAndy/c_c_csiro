The seabed modelling is being carried out by Dr Fanjun Li in the Predictive Geoscience Group at CSIRO Petroleum.Recent work undertaken within the Climate Change Impacts and Risk Stream has yielded new information about future rainfall and wind changes and their associated range of uncertainty over north-east Australia (eg Hennessy et al., 2004a). A range of recent climate projections has been re-examined to extract information in a relevant format for incorporation into SEDSIM model simulations for the domain shown in Figure 1. A set of proposed climate changes for this region provided by CSIRO Petroleum formed the basis for the format of the climate change information provided in this report."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://vises.org.au/documents/2005-Macadam-et-al-Climate-change-projections.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SLSPML2jO8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
