A brief review is presented of the current state of the science in relation to tropical cyclones under greenhouse conditions and of the approach being taken at the Division of Atmospheric Research using a regional climate model. A storm surge model is used to perform a simulation of flooding on Dunk Island caused by a severe tropical cyclone."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/283082.pdf#page=96", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4fzf8r86gu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
