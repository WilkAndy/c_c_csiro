Prior assessments have provided general broad scale information on the resource magnitude, but detail needed to support next level site assessments has been deficient. Aiming to support all stakeholders in Australia's emerging wave energy industry, this study presents a revised assessment of Australia's national wave energy resource. The assessment is based on a state-of-the-art global wave hindcast, with higher resolution in the Australian region. Validation of the hindcast relative to in-situ wave buoy and satellite altimeter observations show better comparison than prior assessments. The total nationally available resource is similar in magnitude to earlier studies, but regional differences are evident. The total integrated energy flux across the 200 m contour is approximately \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2598049907251742133", "cites_id": ["2598049907251742133"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148116307406", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tQV6JqAgDiQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 13, "2020": 27, "2021": 23, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
