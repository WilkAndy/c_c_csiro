These guidelines have been developed as part of the ARENA and CSIRO-funded Australian Wave Energy Atlas Project (AWavEA). A wave energy project cycle typically consists of four stages: Preliminary evaluation; Feasibility study; Project design; and Implementation and operation. The guidelines presented in this paper aim to support preliminary assessments of the suitability of a proposed site to deployment of wave energy converters.A series of idealised simulations of WEC array installations using SNL-SWAN was performed to underpin development of the guidelines, under a range of conditions (device types, array sizes and configurations, wave climate conditions, bed slope, distance offshore). Results are generalised via empirical equations to represent the zone of impact (area, cross-shore distance, and longshore width). These equations provide a basic tool to inform design of more detailed modelling and monitoring assessments of the environment adjacent to proposed wave energy developments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://tethys.pnnl.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AWTEC2018-505.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:godq5LiiSRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
