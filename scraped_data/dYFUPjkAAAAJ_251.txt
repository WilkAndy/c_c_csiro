It may have counterparts elsewhere. A brief review is given of the synoptic aspects of seventeen such fronts which occurred during the period January 1972 to January 1978. These had diverse origins, only rarely being fronts of Southern Ocean origin; mostly they developed ahead of Southern Ocean fronts. In all cases orographical effects appear to play an important role in genesis.A more detailed study is made of two southerly bursters which occurred during an observational program held from 21 November 1982 until 13 December 1982, providing the synoptic background for a more detailed analysis of the structure of these phenomena in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18403705901886614630&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ziy2wAIZZ_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
