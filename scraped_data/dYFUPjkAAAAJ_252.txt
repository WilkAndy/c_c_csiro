Most significant impacts may arise from short lived storm surges and extreme wave events. Climate change may also affect the meteorological drivers leading to extreme sea level events. Recently, storm surge hazard along the coastline of Australia\u2019s island state, Tasmania, has been investigated as part of the \u2018Climate Futures for Tasmania\u2019(CFT) project. Using the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM, McGregor and Dix, 2008), six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Meehl et al., 2007) simulations under two IPCC emission scenarios (A2 and B1) were dynamically downscaled to approximately 60 and 15 km resolution to cover Australia/Tasmania respectively. The impact of climate change on the wind speeds in the CFT climate model simulations indicates an increase in wind speeds particularly on the east coast of Tasmania implying possible changes to storm surge heights in this area in the future. Here we report on the characteristics of storm surges and tides around Southern Australia and Tasmania and present first results on the impact of climate change on storm surges by means of hydrodynamic model simulations that have been forced by the output of selected CFT model simulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39971006/Assessing_current_and_future_storm_surge20151113-30451-131mjuo.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hjN1O_xZEPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
