These include the introduction of high resolution topography, a three-layer soil moisture scheme for the prediction of surface moisture and a second-moment turbulent closure scheme for the vertical transport of momentum, heat and moisture. A case study of an east coast cyclone which inundated Sydney with extreme rainfall on 5 August 1986 is presented to demonstrate the impact of these modi\ufb01cations. This case has been previously stud-ied by the second author and the results here are an extension of that work. We demonstrate that the ARPE initialisation procedure of simply interpolating the coarse mesh topographical heights and model \ufb01elds to \ufb01ne mesh grid-points is conditionally unstable and can produce excessive rainfall at isolated grid-points.
