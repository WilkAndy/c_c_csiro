They include extensive areas of complex and specialized ecosystems, such as mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrasses, which are highly sensitive to human intervention. These ecosystems are the source of a significant proportion of global food production. Moreover, they support a variety of economic activities, including fisheries and aquaculture, tourism, recreation, and transportation. In recent decades, many coastal areas have been heavily modified and intensively developed, which has significantly increased their vulnerability to natural coastal dynamics and the anticipated impacts of global climate change.Many attempts have been made to define the \u201ccoastal zone\u201d and its land and seaward boundaries. Some definitions are based on physiographic characteristics, such as the extent of tidal influence on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9527414491696796810&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ihR_dQAtOIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
