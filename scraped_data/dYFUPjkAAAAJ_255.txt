These studies have used different threshold criteria for deciding the cut-off between systems of tropical storm and tropical depression strength, which for observed storms in the eastern hemisphere is a 10-minute wind speed of 17.5 ms-1(39 mph) measured at a height of 10 metres (1-minute winds in the western hemisphere). The use of differing threshold criteria makes it difficult to compare objectively the simulation of cyclone formation numbers from model to model and between models and observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/108114.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3KkR98WT_T0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
