Globally, sea level is now rising after several centuries of relatively stable values. The rate of rise increased from the 19th to the 20th century and during the 20th century. Since the early 1990s, the rate of rise is almost double the average for the 20th century. Sea levels are rising around Australia and the frequency of extreme high sea-level events that occur on annual to decadal timescales has increased by a factor of about three during the 20th century. Sea-level rise is a result of expansion of the oceans as they warm and the addition of mass to the ocean from glaciers and ice caps, and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century and beyond in response to increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. Including an allowance for the ice sheets, the IPCC projections are for a rise of 18 cm to 79 cm by 2095 compared to 1990. However, our current understanding of the response of ice sheets to global warming is inadequate and a larger rise is possible. Sea levels are currently rising at near the upper end of current projections. Rising sea levels will result in inundation of low-lying coastal regions and coastal erosion. Significant and urgent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are required to avoid the most severe sea-level rise. However, even with a reduction in emissions some further sea-level rise is inevitable and adaptation will be necessary."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.johnroberthunter.org/science/home_prof/papers/church_et_al_2009.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0w1HObCmmzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
