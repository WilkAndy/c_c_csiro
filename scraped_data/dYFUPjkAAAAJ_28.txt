This paper addresses this gap by applying a decision analysis perspective to identify what kind of mean sea level rise (SLR) information is needed for local coastal adaptation decisions. We first characterize these decisions, then identify suitable decision analysis approaches and the sea level information required, and finally discuss if and how these information needs can be met given the state of the art of sea level science. We find that four types of information are needed: (i) probabilistic predictions for short\u2010term decisions when users are uncertainty tolerant; (ii) high\u2010end and low\u2010end SLR scenarios chosen for different levels of uncertainty tolerance; (iii) upper bounds of SLR for users with a low uncertainty tolerance; and (iv) learning scenarios derived from estimating what knowledge \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15420876468036212808", "cites_id": ["15420876468036212808"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018ef001071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SJh6wnH1AdYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 11, "2020": 22, "2021": 31, "2022": 23, "2023": 14}}
