For this return period, levels lie between 1 and 2 m above mean sea level along much of the coastline. Future climate 1\u2010in\u2010100\u2010year storm tide heights were estimated by adding high\u2010end estimates of future sea\u2010level rise from recent literature. The effect of climate change through consistent wind\u2010speed increases was also examined and it was found that, for the late 21st Century, the contribution of wind\u2010speed increase to the increases in extreme storm surge heights is considerably smaller, by a factor of more than 2, than the contribution of sea\u2010level rise.A computationally inexpensive approach to assessing current and future vulnerability to coastal inundation due to sea\u2010level extremes is then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7709833526744111082", "cites_id": ["7709833526744111082"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6tf6fr7U_moJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
