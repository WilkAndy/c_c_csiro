To supplement limited observational records, we use reanalysis surge data from a hydrodynamic model as the basis for dependence mapping, providing information at a resolution of approximately 30 km along the Australian coastline. We evaluated this approach by comparing the dependence estimates from modeled surge to that calculated using historical surge records from 79 tide gauges around Australia. The results show reasonable agreement between the two sets of dependence values, with the exception of lower seasonal variation in the modeled dependence values compared to the observed data, especially at locations where there are multiple processes driving extreme storm surge. This is due to the combined impact of local bathymetry as well as the resolution of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=627931841978527149", "cites_id": ["627931841978527149"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017jc013472", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rW1J8K7ctggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 11, "2020": 17, "2021": 15, "2022": 23, "2023": 6}}
