Coastal zones are especially in need of climate services for adaptation, as they are increasingly threatened by sea level rise and its impacts, such as submergence, flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization and wetland change. In this paper, we examine how annual to multi-decadal sea level projections can be used within coastal climate services (CCS). To this end, we review the current state-of-the art of coastal climate services in the US, Australia and France, and identify lessons learned. More broadly, we also review current barriers in the development of CCS, and identify research and development efforts for overcoming barriers and facilitating their continued growth. The latter includes: (1) research in the field of sea level, coastal and adaptation science and (2) cross-cutting research in the area of user interactions, decision making, propagation of uncertainties and overall service architecture design. We suggest that standard approaches are required to translate relative sea level information into the forms required to inform the wide range of relevant decisions across coastal management, including coastal adaptation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5534737866818137334", "cites_id": ["5534737866818137334"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/230176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9iyZ_MNWz0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
