Their severity depends on the strength and duration of the atmospheric disturbance, and the structure of the coastal terrain. Severe storm surges can cause inundation of low-lying coastal plains and flooding of river systems and, combined with wind-generated wave action, can cause coastal and estuarine erosion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1259185156656334466", "cites_id": ["1259185156656334466"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5b7fe1a1472b929d6dd2617a9af405243394b1a5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ggbygDqGeREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
