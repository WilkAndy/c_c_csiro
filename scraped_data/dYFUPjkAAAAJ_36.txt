The model is set up over the Gold Coast Broadwater on the east coast of Australia. This complex region features a coastal lagoon into which five tributaries flow and is subject to flooding from extreme oceanic conditions such as storm surge and wave setup as well as terrestrial runoff. Weather conditions responsible for storm surge, waves and flooding include cyclones of both tropical and mid-latitude origin.Two events are modelled. The first is an east coast low event that occurred in April 1989. This event verified well against available observations and analysis of the model simulations revealed that wave setup produced a greater contribution to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12310244071987979374", "cites_id": ["12310244071987979374"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007030200027", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bqQz0cLF1qoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
