Projections of sea-level rise (SLR) for 2090 for the Australian coast line are similar to the global mean sea-level projections. The global and regional projections are almost independent of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for greenhouse gas emissions chosen for the first decades of the 21st century, but they begin to diverge signifi cantly from about 2050. For the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5), the rates increase steadi ly through the 21st century, reaching almost 12 mm yr-1 by 2100 at all locations. For the inter mediate scenarios of RCP 6.0 and RCP 4.5, the rates stabilise in about 2090 and 2060 at about 7-8 and 6 mm yr -1 , respectively. For the strong mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6, requiring signifi cant and urgent mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions), the rate of rise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11205683473258199123", "cites_id": ["11205683473258199123"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mo/es15009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UzgFqb-VgpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
