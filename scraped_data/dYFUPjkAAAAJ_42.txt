The lows are also studied individually to compare their development and movement, as well as synoptic features, which may have been smoothed out in the compositing process. Finally, the incidence of all such lows in the 1 \u00d7 CO             2             and 2 \u00d7 CO             2             simulations are examined to determine the possible effects a doubling of CO             2             will have on their occurrence.           The GCM surface lows were found to develop from an upper-level cutoff low in a manner similar to the observed lows. In both sets, this development took place between the upper-level subtropical and polar jets in all seasons except summer, where only one jet was evident.
