Our primary focus is on the wave field and swell influence in the Southern Hemisphere, and we apply our analysis to each of the four temperate-zone seasons comprising March\u2013May (MAM), June\u2013August (JJA), September-November (SON), and December\u2013February (DJF). Statistically significant anomalies in significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) and zonal wave energy flux (CgE) are found to covary with local variations in surface zonal wind induced by the low and high polarity phases of the SAM.The signature of the SAM in ocean surface waves extends beyond local wind-generated forcing in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics to remote forcing in the Northern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3274260346598946123", "cites_id": ["3274260346598946123"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500318300441", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S3Ut_W-CcC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 13, "2021": 19, "2022": 11, "2023": 9}}
