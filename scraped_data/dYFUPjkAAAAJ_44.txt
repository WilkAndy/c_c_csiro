Their duration often exceeds a day and the combination of elevated sea levels with the high rainfall that commonly accompanies these events means that coastal flooding can be a major hazard. The processes contributing to higher-than-normal sea levels are a combination of storm surge and breaking wave setup. Three events are modelled using an atmospheric model, storm surge model and wave setup model. The storm surges resulting from the depressions are found to explain between one-third and one-half of the measured sea-level residuals at the coast and are shown to develop in a regime of coast-parallel winds that produce onshore Ekman transport. The timing of the storm surges are well captured in two of the events in which the atmospheric depressions are of broad spatial scale and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13980260641021406407", "cites_id": ["13980260641021406407"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/meteorological-applications/article/impact-of-eastern-australian-cutoff-lows-on-coastal-sea-levels/E1CA904028AAF8DD44CEBE44167B4C45", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x6x0f_vcA8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
