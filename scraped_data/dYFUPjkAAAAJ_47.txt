In this study, an ensemble of wave model simulations have been used to assess the ability of climate model winds to reproduce the present-day (1981\u20132000) mean wave climate and its seasonal variability for the southeast coast of Australia. Surface wind forcing was obtained from three dynamically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-3) global climate model (GCM) simulations (CSIRO Mk3.5, GFDLcm2.0 and GFDLcm2.1). The downscaling was performed using CSIRO\u2019s cubic conformal atmospheric model (CCAM) over the Australian region at approximately 60-km resolution. The wind climates derived from the CCAM downscaled GCMs were assessed against observations (QuikSCAT and NCEP Re-analysis 2 (NRA-2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16421017362588011570", "cites_id": ["16421017362588011570"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10236-011-0486-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MoyU-0ks4-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
