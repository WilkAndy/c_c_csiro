These systems are associated with severe weather in the south\u2010east Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. Two types of cutoff low formation are identified, described here as coastal lows and blocking lows.Twenty\u2010four hour numerical simulations are performed for four systems in order to investigate the model\u2010reproduced structure of the large\u2010scale rainfall and gale\u2010force wind. The numerical experiments demonstrated that the regional\u2010scale model is capable of simulating the heavy rainfall and gale\u2010force winds associated with these systems. All systems are characterized by a major rain band curling around the south and east of the surface low. To the south of the system the rain band is paralleled by a curved band of gale\u2010strength winds.
