The violent behaviour of some cold-frontal passages, or southerly busters, is found to be at least orographically initiated, but the phenomenon does not exhibit the characteristics of a coastally-trapped density current. The head of the front has the character of an evolving density current and its propagation is well predicted by density current theory over more than half of its lifetime. Nevertheless, it differs from steady laboratory-simulated examples in that a horizontal roll-vortex just behind the front is found to be accelerating relative to the rate of advection of cold air behind the front. This implies that its evolution will be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12214363851795952336", "cites_id": ["12214363851795952336"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00120714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0HKrbzUjgqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 5, "1987": 4, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 5, "1991": 2, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
