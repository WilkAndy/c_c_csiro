However, these sea level extremes are not well characterised by available tide gauge records owing to the low frequency of occurrence of tropical cyclones, the sparse array of tide gauges and the short time frame over which many gauges in this region have been operating. In this study, a combined statistical/dynamical method for estimating storm tide risk is presented. Tropical cyclones in the Fiji region over the period 1969\u20132007 are characterised in a statistical model that represents cyclone frequency, intensity and movement. The statistical model is then used to develop a population of \u201csynthetic\u201d cyclones that provide boundary conditions to a hydrodynamic storm surge and tidal model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12205227822109450659", "cites_id": ["12205227822109450659"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818114000411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o2GMwwmuYakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
