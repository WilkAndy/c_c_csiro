We used a dynamical downscaling method to generate climate projections over Tasmania at a resolution of about 10 km. Six global climate models from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report were used, each for a high and low emissions scenario. The downscaled simulations of mean annual temperature and rainfall produced a spatial correlation of 0.93 and 0.63 respectively when compared to observations for the 1961-1990 reference period. The successful validation of climate simulations gives confidence in projections of future temperature and rainfall and their application to the analysis of extremes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17572199175958350257", "cites_id": ["17572199175958350257"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39971003/Climate_Futures_for_Tasmania_extreme_eve20151113-30451-1qo115x.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sclojQz-3PMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 7, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
