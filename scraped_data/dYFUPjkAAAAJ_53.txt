The development of a thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) associated with the atmospheric convection above a wide open lead is modeled for several different temperature profiles characteristic of the Arctic winter. Large differences in the predicted top of the TIBL are observed between two simple diagnostic models and the time\u2010dependent model introduced here. The modeled thermodynamic processes (i.e., radiative transfer and condensation/evaporation) occurring within the TIBL above an open lead are shown to account for as much as 20% of the predicted TIBL top height. Radiative heating dominates the heat budget in the lowest model level while sensible and latent heating occur \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12377301941824388082", "cites_id": ["12377301941824388082"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JC02654", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8vsx0IkCxasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
