These low-pressure systems, known as east coast lows (ECLs), have been examined in a wide range of different studies, with considerable variations between such studies in what they consider to be an ECL, and their findings on the characteristics of these storm systems. Here we present reviews of literature and other information such as operational forecasting approaches, which are then used to produce a comprehensive synthesis of knowledge on ECLs and associated weather and ocean extremes. This includes aspects such as their definition, formation, meteorology, climatology and drivers of variability from short-term \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15991688528264015209", "cites_id": ["15991688528264015209"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-019-04836-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aa3dJf3j7d0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 21, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
