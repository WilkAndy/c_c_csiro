The wind\u2010wave climate is modelled for three 20 year time\u2010slices (1981\u20132000, 2031\u20132051, and 2081\u20132100) using a dynamical wave modelling approach in which the WaveWatch III spectral wave model, with a nested domain SWAN model, is the region of interest. Surface wind forcing is obtained from an ensemble of three global climate model runs (CSIRO Mk3.5, GFDLcm2.0, and GFDLcm2.1) dynamically downscaled using CSIRO's Cubic conformal atmospheric model (CCAM), under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (a high emission SRES A2 and low emission SRES B1 scenario). A third level of uncertainty associated with adjusting climate model derived winds for climate and variability bias is found to be the largest source of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5439156152441583385", "cites_id": ["5439156152441583385"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3537", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GTcp6LPDe0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
