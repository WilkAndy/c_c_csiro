Vic. Dep. Sustain. Environ. 56pp, 2009", "author": "Kathleen L McInnes and Ian Macadam and Julian O\u2019Grady", "journal": "Rep. Vic. Dep. Sustain. Environ. 56pp", "abstract": "Victoria\u2019s coastline is highly valued for its aesthetic, ecological, recreational and economic assets. Since the late 1990\u2019s, a rapid increase in the rate of internal migration from large cities to the coast, referred to as the Sea Change Phenomenon (Gurren et al., 2005), has led to an increase in development pressure in coastal towns and elsewhere along the coast. The increase in population pressure and the value of assets along the coast poses challenges for those responsible for the sustainable management of the coast. Climate change is creating a significant additional challenge to coastal management and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Rising sea levels and other changes to the climate system mean that the coast cannot be considered a static entity for the purposes of planning and management and the consequences of future climate change must be considered.A range of natural hazards pose risks to Victoria\u2019s coastal regions. Low-lying coastal terrain is vulnerable to inundation during high sea level events caused by storm surges or due to increased riverine flows due to heavy rainfall. Soft shorelines may experience severe erosion during storm surge or high wave events. Such events may occur in isolation or in combination. Rising mean sea levels and possible changes in the behaviour of severe weather conditions are likely to increase the frequency and severity of extreme sea level events in the future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7553854454231108107", "cites_id": ["7553854454231108107"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39971026/The_Effect_of_Climate_Change_on_Extreme_20151113-2832-1t7kpwp.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C4pypZqu1GgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
