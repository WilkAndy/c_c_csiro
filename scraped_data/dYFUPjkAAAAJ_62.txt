Special emphasis is given to how inter-model variability translates from wave projections to wave-driven coastal impacts, which is still poorly known. Results show that the uncertainty is in general larger, especially for LST, for which the discrepancies among regional models are more relevant than those associated with the forcing wave parameters. Such increase in the uncertainty can be explained by the nonlinear processes involved, and the role of the forcing wave parameters having sometimes competing effects (e.g. wave height vs. wave direction). This illustrates that the performance of each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5585007841145669720", "cites_id": ["5585007841145669720"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-015-0923-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WEhCdwrvgU0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 6}}
