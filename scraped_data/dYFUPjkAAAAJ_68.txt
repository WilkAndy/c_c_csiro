Here we investigate the cumulative risk arising from multiple drivers (sea\u2010level rise; changes in rainfall, ocean\u2013atmosphere oscillations and tropical cyclone intensity; ocean warming and acidification) to five Habitability Pillars: Land, Freshwater supply, Food supply, Settlements and infrastructure, and Economic activities. Risk is assessed for urban and rural islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, in 2050 and 2090, and considering a moderate adaptation scenario. Risks will be highest in the Western Pacific which will experience increased island destabilization together with a high threat to freshwater, and decreased land\u2010based and marine food supply \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1286598235905790432", "cites_id": ["1286598235905790432"], "pub_url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4BHPY0fq2hEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 19, "2023": 5}}
