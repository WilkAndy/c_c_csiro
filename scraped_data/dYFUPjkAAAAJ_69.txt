Regional patterns of shoreline behaviour are important for resolving consistent or, alternatively, dissimilar patterns of past shoreline change. Such patterns are best explored using temporally frequent and spatially extensive datasets. Here we analyse satellite-derived shorelines to identify spatial patterns of hotspots of coastline change on the wave-exposed coast of Victoria in south-east Australia where rates of change exceed 0.5 m yr\u22121. Analysis of shoreline position changes at a 50 m alongshore interval along 900 km of the 1230 km coastline reveals a number of distinct behaviours related to coastal type (rock vs sand coast), landform, shoreline orientation and/or anthropogenic drivers of change.
