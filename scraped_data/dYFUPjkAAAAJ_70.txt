CSIRO Atmospheric Research, Aspendale", "abstract": "This report presents results from the second part of a project undertaken for the New South Wales (NSW) Greenhouse Office to assess future changes in NSW climate. Results focus on regionally-specific changes in droughts, extreme temperatures, heavy rainfall, strong winds, extreme weather systems and storm tides. This complements the first part of the project (Hennessy et al., 2004) which focussed on past climate variability and projected changes in average climate. Conclusions from the first part are summarised in Appendix A.To estimate future climate change, scientists have developed greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios. These are not predictions of what will actually happen. They allow analysis of \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions based on various assumptions about human behaviour, economic growth and technological change (Appendix B). This report uses scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Some IPCC scenarios assume \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d without explicit policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, although some scenarios include other environmental policies that indirectly affect greenhouse gases. These are described in the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Other IPCC scenarios include actions to reduce CO2 emissions and stabilise CO2 concentrations at some level above the current value of 375 ppm. These would postpone or avoid some of the more serious damages associated with higher rates of warming. In this project, most projections are based on the SRES scenarios rather than the CO2 stabilisation scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5865883766923282022", "cites_id": ["5865883766923282022"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/hennessy_2004c.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZkYxDTXOZ1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
