Two aspects of storm surge have been investigated, return periods under current climate and the possible changes under climate change.The storm surge, a dome of water pushed ahead of a cyclone by strong winds, is one of the most damaging aspects of tropical cyclones particularly when combined adversely with astronomical tides. Estimates of the return periods, or the average time between events, of the combination of storm surges and tides (ie storm tides) in the Cairns region have been made. These estimates were made by combining a statistical representation of cyclones affecting Cairns, determined through an analysis of historical cyclone records in the Cairns region, with a depth-averaged numerical model of the coastal ocean. Probability distributions of cyclone characteristics such as intensity, speed and direction provided the domain from which characteristics could be randomly sampled to construct cyclones. These statistics were used to generate 1000 artificial cyclones to simulate the full range of storms likely to affect the Cairns region. The resulting cyclone winds were randomly phased with tides and used to force a numerical storm surge model. The modelled storm tides were then ranked and their return periods calculated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10154289285596367194", "cites_id": ["10154289285596367194"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kathleen-Mcinnes/publication/241449151_Impact_of_Sea-level_Rise_and_Storm_Surges_on_Coastal_Resorts/links/00b4952f98758a8909000000/Impact-of-Sea-level-Rise-and-Storm-Surges-on-Coastal-Resorts.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WsmGNk5I64wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
