Confidence in the current incidence of wind hazard depends upon the type of storm producing the hazard. Current hail hazard is poorly quantified in most regions of Australia. Future projections of wind hazard indicate decreases in wind hazard in northern Australia, increases along the east coast and decreases in the south, although such projections are considerably uncertain and are more uncertain for small-scale storms than for larger storms. A number of research gaps are identified and recommendations made."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7564138500189776051", "cites_id": ["7564138500189776051"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1737-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s-iqr-M3-WgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
