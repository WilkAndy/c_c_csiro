Hydrodynamical modelling and statistical analysis of extreme sea level events are used to develop spatial patterns of storm surge recurrence intervals under present climate conditions and those projected to occur in 2030 and 2070"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9561178849309963277", "cites_id": ["9561178849309963277"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9561178849309963277&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DTQZk4EhsIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
