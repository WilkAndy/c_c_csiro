In this paper, the ability of Earth System Models to simulate observed temperature and ocean acidification around Australia is as sessed. The model results are also compared with observations collected at stations around Australia over recent years to assess how representative the model results are of the coastal domain; and are found to adequately simulate the mean state at most sites. Simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under low, medium and high emissions scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 respectively) are then used to project how ocean acidification and sea surface temperature will change. Under each of these emissions scenarios the oceans around Australia exhibit warming and continued acidification. However, these changes are quite heterogeneous, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15957895152419359777", "cites_id": ["15957895152419359777"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MO/ES15012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IUzishfVdd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
