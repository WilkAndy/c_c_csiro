The modern \u2018sea change\u2019phenomena is seeing even more people moving to the coast, leading to rapidly growing populations in such areas as the Gold and Sunshine Coasts in South-East Queensland, and the northern New South Wales coastal region. Chen and McAneney (2006) estimate that about half of Australia\u2019s population lives within 7 km of the coast, with as many as 30%, or about six million people, within 2 km of the coast. They also estimate about 6% of Australian addresses are situated within 3 km of shorelines in areas with elevations below 5 m above mean sea level. The coastal margins are intimately affected by the level of the sea, which varies over a wide range of time scales. Sea level is influenced by ocean waves, twice-daily and daily tides, meteorological fluctuations over days to weeks, and seasonal, inter-annual, decadal and multi-decadal variations. Superimposed on these variations, there has been an overall rise at a rate of just less than 2 mm per year in global mean sea level during the 20th century. This rise was caused predominantly by rising global temperatures (Bindoff et al. 2007; IPCC 2007). Coastal vulnerability is affected by an increase in ocean volume causing a rise in globally averaged sea level, redistribution of ocean mass associated with changing climate and by vertical movement of the land. There are large-scale vertical motions of the Earth\u2019s crust associated with past and ongoing changes of surface loads on the earth (glacial isostatic adjustment) and local tectonic motions (particularly subsidence) in some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=826381504365960004", "cites_id": ["826381504365960004"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Yw-QVvwebDsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA191&dq=info:RJuvkJnldwsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kn95k0rYZk&sig=HQ2d8d3tnn6HGVEgwOtJDyTEOo0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RJuvkJnldwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
