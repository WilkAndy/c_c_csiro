A layperson\u2019s description of the physical operating principle is given for the main classes of technology that have been tested in Australian waters. The Australian marine domain possesses among the world\u2019s most energetic wave-energy resources, driven by powerful mid-latitude westerly winds. The northern coast of Western Australia has tidal ranges significant on a global scale, and some geographical features around the continent have local tidal resonances. The East Australian Current, one of the world\u2019s major western boundary currents, runs along the eastern Australian seaboard, offering potential for ocean-current energy. Sea-water temperatures in the tropical north-east of Australia may permit ocean thermal energy conversion. While this abundance of resources makes Australia an ideal location for technology development, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15035057724696315273", "cites_id": ["15035057724696315273"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1759313116684525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iUUEaldBp9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
