Specifically we consider the problem of multi-layered clouds in the boundary layer that includes the decoupling of the turbulence between upper and lower clouds. A high-resolution one-dimensional model with second-order turbulence closure and spectral radiative transfer is used to simulate a case study that was obtained during the 1980 Arctic Stratus Experiment. The effects of radiation, large-scale vertical motion and drizzle are investigated in sensitivity studies. Results of this study show that radiative transfer is important to the maintenance of the multiple cloud layers, and suggest that weak rising vertical motion is the most favorable situation to maintain two separate cloud layers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7583026215827546910", "cites_id": ["7583026215827546910"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00708933", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HiPgrCpSPGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 6, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
