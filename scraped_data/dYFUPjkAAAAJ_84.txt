It is demonstrated that the model, run at 50-km resolution, is capable of capturing the transition of a cold front into a southerly buster as it traverses the cut coast of the Australian continent. The main features of the modified front am identified through comparison of the simulation with an \u201cadiabatic simulation\u201d from which precipitation and surface processes including orography have been removed. From this comparison, the southerly buster effect is defined in terms of the deformation of the front from its adiabatic ostentation and in terms of enhancement of temperature gradients and southerly winds along the coastal strip. Sensitivity experiments are then analyzed with a view to objectively determining the relative roles of mountains, precipitation, and land-sea contrasts of heating and friction in bringing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15395385769469096723", "cites_id": ["15395385769469096723"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/121/7/1520-0493_1993_121_1904_asbpia_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EzNPAcplp9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
