Climate variability is one such issue that is impacted by, and impacts on, several other areas (eg coastal processes, infrastructure, health and regional economies). These interdependencies create challenges for local governments to scale up management responses to tackle issues at a regional scale. Critical to this process of scaling up is the concept of adaptive capacity, which is affected by a range of contextual, institutional and procedural factors. Research is being undertaken to support local governments in the Sydney region to improve their adaptive capacity to deal with the impacts of climate variability and change; hence, the chapter is more about testing \u2018new solutions\u2019 than about reporting on them. The goal of this research is to work with local governments to determine key vulnerabilities and their capacity to adapt in order to manage these risks at a regional scale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15815407193971788619", "cites_id": ["15815407193971788619"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cIxK3g0uucAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA331&dq=info:S4vYngyde9sJ:scholar.google.com&ots=d_fkFJGMRc&sig=o4V0zWY_kiqFZAEjvFQlCTEuZlY", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S4vYngyde9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
