These criteria are derived from the wind profiles of observed tropical cyclones, averaged at various resolutions. Both an analytical wind profile model and two-dimensional observed wind analyses are used. The results show that the threshold wind speed of an observed tropical cyclone varies roughly linearly with resolution. The criteria derived here are compared to the numerous different criteria previously employed in climate model simulations. The resulting method provides a simple means of comparing climate model simulations and reanalyses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 283, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7905154288935574127", "cites_id": ["7905154288935574127"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/10/jcli4074.1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bxqpRvG_tG0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 13, "2011": 14, "2012": 17, "2013": 24, "2014": 24, "2015": 23, "2016": 26, "2017": 13, "2018": 18, "2019": 18, "2020": 20, "2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 11}}
