A storm surge model, which features a nesting capability and inundation algorithm, is described. The flooding and draining is dependent on the modelled current in adjacent \u2018wet\u2019 grid cells which ensures realistic and smoothly varying results. Several examples of the application of this system are presented. Through these examples, it is demonstrated that the inundation model is robust in a variety of geographical locations and under a range of grid resolutions. Surge heights at the coast are also compared with simulations where overland inundation is switched off and it is found that elevations are greater by up to 17% when the coastal boundary is approximated by a fixed wall.
