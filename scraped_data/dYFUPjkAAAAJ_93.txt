One such impact is inundation due to storm surges and high waves that occur during severe storms. The present study builds on a previous study on extreme sea levels due to storm surge and tides by coupling a wave model to the same hydrodynamic model to explore the additional contribution to extreme sea levels due to breaking wave setup. Model results are presented here for one coastal location with a southwest to northeast oriented coastline for two different storm events. In the first case consisting of a mid-latitude low pressure system with onshore winds, the modelled setup values are typically around 10% of the modelled incident wave height, however there is no storm surge produced. The second system is a west to east propagating cold front \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4418235902661393836", "cites_id": ["4418235902661393836"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/25737938", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rH0CCCW6UD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
