Typical spatial scales of these cyclones are on the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers. Therefore they cannot be simulated in global climate models with resolutions of several hundred kilometers. Thus speculation has been largely based on extrapolation from their present observed distribution, and on simple parametric relationships. However, the conditions under which tropical cyclones form, the intensities they reach, and their usual paths depend on a number of dynamic and thermodynamic factors that may change in complex ways with changing climate. Recent studies using finer resolution global and regional climate models, sensitivity studies that model individual cyclones, and parametric studies have been reviewed. These suggest that the future behavior of tropical cyclones \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13652539172443920754,18212761095084631265", "cites_id": ["13652539172443920754", "18212761095084631265"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-1053-4_15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:chmgBwuQd70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
