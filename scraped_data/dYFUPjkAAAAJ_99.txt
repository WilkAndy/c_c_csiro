If wave energy is to become a significant part of renewable energy portfolios, then wave energy converters (WECs) will need to be installed in large numbers in array configurations. The environmental effects of wave energy extraction to date has relied on physical (i.e., tank) and numerical modelling studies.In this study, a network of in situ wave measurement devices were deployed around an array of three submerged point absorber WECs, operating intermittently, each with a nominal 240\u202fkW peak capacity. The study site was 3\u202fkm offshore (in approximately 24\u202fm water depth) and the field campaign was conducted over approximately one year, with a primary goal of studying \u2018down-wave\u2019 effects of the WECs. The observations were used to calibrate and validate a numerical spectral wave model which can represent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dYFUPjkAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3834851996323195766", "cites_id": ["3834851996323195766"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378383917304623", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dqsKn5IhODUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
