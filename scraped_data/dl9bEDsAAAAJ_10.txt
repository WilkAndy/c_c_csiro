In this paper, chromosome 1 linkage maps of Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, and T. monococcum are compared with existing barley and rye maps to develop a consensus map for Triticeae species and thus facilitate the mapping of agronomic genes in this tribe. The consensus map that was developed consists of 14 agronomically important genes, 17 DNA markers that were derived from known-function clones, and 76 DNA markers derived from anonymous clones. There are 12 inconsistencies in the order of markers among seven wheat, four barley, and two rye maps. A comparison of the Triticeae group 1 chromosome consensus map with linkage maps of homoeologous chromosomes in rice indicates that the linkage maps for the long arm and the proximal portion of the short arm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 397, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6104787181336944042", "cites_id": ["6104787181336944042"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g95-006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ql3yzJiPuFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 7, "1996": 21, "1997": 20, "1998": 22, "1999": 21, "2000": 24, "2001": 34, "2002": 33, "2003": 18, "2004": 30, "2005": 23, "2006": 26, "2007": 14, "2008": 21, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 6, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
