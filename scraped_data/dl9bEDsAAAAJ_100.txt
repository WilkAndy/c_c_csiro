Variation in dough properties was not influenced by protein content. HMW subunits of glutenin, particularly those of the Glu-D1 locus were largely responsible for differences in dough breakdown and maximum resistance but not for extensibility of the dough. The Glu-D1d allele (subunits 5 and 10) inherited from \u2018Nuri 70\u2019 was associated with lower dough breakdown and higher maximum resistance than its allelic counterpart Glu-D1a (2 and 12) derived from \u2018UL 82\u2019 while the subunits 17 and 18 of the Glu-B1 locus conferred slightly greater dough extensibility. No significant association was observed between the dough properties and gliadin composition in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9210852118173586460", "cites_id": ["9210852118173586460"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521088800572", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HBRkRjOF038J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
