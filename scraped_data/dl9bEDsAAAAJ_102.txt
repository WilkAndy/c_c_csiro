This protein was present along with other HMW glutenin subunits named 2t and T2, and was considered as part of the same allele at the Glu-D  t  1 locus of T. tauschii. This paper describes a re-evaluation of this protein, involving analyses of a collection of 173 accessions of T. tauschii, by SDS-PAGE of glutenin subunits after the extraction of monomeric protein. No accessions were found containing the three HMW glutenin subunits. On the other hand, 17 lines with HMW glutenin subunits having electrophoretic mobilities similar to subunits 2t and T2 were identified. The absence of T1 protein in these gel patterns has shown that protein T1 is not a component of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1216448703644569194", "cites_id": ["1216448703644569194"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-001-0778-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ag44pKax4RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
