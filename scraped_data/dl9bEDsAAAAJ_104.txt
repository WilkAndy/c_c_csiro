We have also screened a selection of synthetic hexaploid wheats, produced by hybridizing T. tauschii with tetraploid wheats, as well as the first and second generations of hybrids between some of these synthetics and commercial wheats. Almost 90% of the T. tauschii accessions and two-thirds of the synthetic hexaploids were resistant to STB. In the intercrosses with susceptible commercial wheats (e.g. Egret), the STB resistance was effectively transmitted as a single dominant gene, as indicated by a 3:l ratio of resistant: susceptible plants in F2 progenies. In crosses with the STB-resistant wheat, M1696, a 15:l ratio in F2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12191856993321617883", "cites_id": ["12191856993321617883"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR9920433", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2wlMF1ctMqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
