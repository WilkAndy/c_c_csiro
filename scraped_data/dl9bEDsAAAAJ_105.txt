We used 148 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from the cross of Avocet \u00d7 Kundan for determining and mapping the genetic basis of adult plant resistance (APR) loci. The population was phenotyped LR and YR for three seasons in field trials conducted in Mexico and genotyped with the diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArT-Seq) and simple sequence repeat markers. The final genetic map was constructed using 2,937 polymorphic markers with an average distance of 1.29 centimorgans between markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified two co-located APR quantitative trait loci (QTL) for LR and YR, two LR QTL, and three YR QTL. The co-located resistance QTL on chromosome 1BL corresponded to the pleiotropic APR gene Lr46/Yr29. QLr.cim-2BL, QYr.cim-2AL, and QYr.cim-5AS could be identified as new resistance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5160801111496256768", "cites_id": ["5160801111496256768"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/pdis-06-16-0890-re", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AO0sj0TZnkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 7}}
