A potentially useful source of resistance has been identified in an accession of Aegilops tauschii. To study the genetics of resistance of this source a cross was made between the resistant Ae. tauschii accession, RL5271, and a susceptible accession, CPI110889. The resistant parent took significantly longer to develop symptoms, developed significantly fewer lesions and expressed significantly lower levels of disease than the susceptible parent. The F1 mean response for disease severity indicated there was no complete dominance. The F3 families were classified using three approaches. In the first approach the individual F3 plant response was used to classify the F3 families. In the second approach the F3 family means and standard errors were used to classify the F3 families. In the final approach Best Linear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9145603457929441134", "cites_id": ["9145603457929441134"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1003981525052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bu93tuO1634J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
