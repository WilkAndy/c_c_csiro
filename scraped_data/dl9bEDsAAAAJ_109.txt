The Dgas44 sequence occurs on all chromosomes of the D genome of wheat, Triticum aestivum, and in situ hybridization revealed it to be evenly dispersed on all seven chromosome pairs. An internal HindIII fragment of Dgas44, designated Dgas44-3, defines the highly amplified region that is specific to the D genome. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a 236-bp fragment within Dgas44-3 from chromosomes 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, and 7D, and identical copies of this region of the Dgas44-3 sequence were found among the isolates from each of the chromosomes. The Dgas44-3 sequence population from specific chromosomes differed on average by 0.22% from the original Dgas44 sequence. The Dgas44 sequence was found to differentiate between the D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=349194952354185248", "cites_id": ["349194952354185248"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g94-044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IEBuhPWW2AQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
