Wheat cultivars are affected by multiple diseases including the rusts and powdery mildew. The F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from \u2018Thatcher\u2019\u22173/\u2018CI13227\u2019 that had been previously characterized as having adult\u2010plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr46 were further tested for resistance to stripe rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew. In field plot tests, the RILs segregated for resistance to stripe rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew, with the highest logarithm of odds (LOD) peak at the sequence tagged site marker csLV46, which is closely linked to Lr46 on chromosome 1BL. Marker csLV46 had the highest LOD scores and R2 values for powdery mildew resistance, followed by stripe rust and leaf rust resistance. Tests for stem rust resistance had the lowest LOD scores.
