Since the mid-twentieth century directed efforts at Ae tauschii introgressions into wheat has come from two avenues. Firstly, the more common approach of artificial hexaploid wheat synthesis that is generated by crossing tetraploid wheats with Ae tauschii and secondly, the process of direct introgression which involves Ae tauschii crosses with bread wheat and through repeated backcrosses to recover a stable bread wheat derivative. Additional refinements have also come from single Ae tauschii chromosome substitutions in wheat to generate sequential segmental introgressed blocks. Using these approaches, numerous traits with improvements to biotic and abiotic stresses \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12492066991210047354", "cites_id": ["12492066991210047354"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23494-6_10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eid1Ib68XK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
