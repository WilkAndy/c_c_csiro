We are using a combination of microsatellite, sequence tagged site, and Diversity Array Technology markers for haplotyping, pyramiding, and mapping stem rust resistance genes. The primary goal of our research team is to identify and optimize markers for previously characterized and novel stem rust resistance genes in wheat. The specific objectives are to: 1) optimize markers for previously characterized stem rust resistance genes to maximize efficiency of the breeding programs, 2) haplotype uncharacterized rust resistant genotypes to infer novelty and to plan new mapping experiments, 3) pyramid novel sources of rust resistance, and 4) map novel sources of rust resistance, including adult plant resistance. To date, we have evaluated 58 markers associated with 21 stem rust resistance genes and used 20 for haplotyping 318 wheat lines and varieties for 15 Ug99 effective resistance genes. This germplasm panel is also being DArT genotyped. For tetraploids, the pyramiding includes Sr2, Sr13 and Sr25 in the breeding line UC1113 which is a high yielding semi-dwarf durum variety with the high-grain protein content gene Gpc-B1 and the non-race specific stripe rust resistance gene Yr36. The Australian group is developing markers for the stem rust resistance genes Sr33 and Sr45 that come from Aegilops tauschii and are located on wheat chromosomes 1DS. Diagnostic, codominant markers for Sr25 and Sr26 have been developed and are being pyramided into CIMMYT breeding lines.
