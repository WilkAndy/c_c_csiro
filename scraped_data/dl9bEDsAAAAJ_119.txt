This investigation was planned to identify new genomic regions contributing towards resistance to three rust diseases under field conditions in a W195/BT-Schomburgk Selection (BTSS) RIL population. The RIL population was assessed for variation in stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust responses at two locations during 2012 and 2013 crop seasons and was subjected to DArTseq genotyping. Linkage map was constructed using 3439 DArTseq markers with an average marker density of 2.7 cM. Composite interval mapping detected three QTL each for stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust resistance in W195/BTSS RIL population. Two consistent QTL for stripe rust, QYr.sun-3BS and QYr.sun-4DL, were contributed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13314070185258226479", "cites_id": ["13314070185258226479"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10681-016-1640-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L5Pv4koUxbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
