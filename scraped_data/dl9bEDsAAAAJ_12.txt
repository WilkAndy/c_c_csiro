However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5\u201315 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (linkage drag). Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq)-that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr22 and Sr45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 352, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5771184344671007342", "cites_id": ["5771184344671007342"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bjJpnZVdF1AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 15, "2017": 44, "2018": 50, "2019": 50, "2020": 62, "2021": 59, "2022": 55, "2023": 17}}
