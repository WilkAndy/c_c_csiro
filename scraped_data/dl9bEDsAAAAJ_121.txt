A recombinant doubled haploid (DH) population was derived from the haploid component of polyembryonic F2 seeds originating from a cross between a wilt resistant, twinning Linola\u2122 Linola is a registered trademark of CSIRO line CRZY8/RA91 and the wilt susceptible Australian flax cultivar Glenelg. The segregation of resistance was studied in 143 DH lines under glasshouse and field conditions. Most of the phenotypic variation was attributable to the segregation of two independent genes with additive effects. Minor resistance genes may have also contributed by modifying the resistance response.
