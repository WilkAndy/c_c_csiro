Host resistance (R) genes are widely studied as a means to combat disease. Lr13 is regarded as one of the most widely distributed leaf rust R genes in wheat (McIntosh et al., 1995). Researchers observed that lines carrying Lr13 consistently gave hybrid necrosis in specific crosses. Hybrid necrosis (henceforth, HN) in wheat, ascribed to NE loci (Hermsen, 1963), is a genetic incompatibility disorder encountered in inter-and intra-specific hybrids caused by complementary alleles Ne1 on chromosome arm 5BL and Ne2 on chromosome arm 2BS (Nishikawa et al., 1974). A range of necrosis symptoms is caused by multiple alleles at both loci, varying from complete lethality of F1 hybrids (strong \u2018\u2018s\u2019\u2019alleles) to near-normal hybrids that segregate in F2 (weak \u2018\u2018w\u2019\u2019alleles).
