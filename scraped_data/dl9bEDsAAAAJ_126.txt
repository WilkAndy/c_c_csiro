In this study, we mapped an adult\u2010plant resistance locus from the Argentinean wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Klein Chaj\u00e1, which is effective against these new Pst races. By using wheat exome capture data and a large population of 2480 segregating plants (4960 gametes), we mapped QYr.ucw\u20101BL within a 0.24\u2010cM region [332 kb in International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) RefSeq version 1.0] on chromosome arm 1BL. This region overlaps with current maps of the adult\u2010plant Pst resistance gene Yr29, which has remained effective for more than 60 yr. An allelism test failed to find recombination between QYr.ucw\u20101BL and Yr29 and yielded similar resistance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=307229473979112088", "cites_id": ["307229473979112088"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3835/plantgenome2018.08.0055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mBoOLZR_QwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
