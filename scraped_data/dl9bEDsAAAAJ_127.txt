A stem rust resistance gene from a South African wheat W3757, temporarily named SrB, has been transferred onto chromosome 6A. Line W3757 is a 6Ae#3 (6D) substitution line in which the Thinopyrum ponticum chromosomes carry SrB. Crosses were made between W3757 and a T6AS\u00b76AL-6Ae#1 recombinant line named WA-5 carrying the stem rust resistance gene Sr26 on a chromosome segment from another accession of Th. ponticum. The 6Ae#1 and 6Ae#3 chromosomes had previously been shown to pair at meiosis and were polymorphic for the distally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8592345970299507911", "cites_id": ["8592345970299507911"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-018-3224-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xxT2wiIlPncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
