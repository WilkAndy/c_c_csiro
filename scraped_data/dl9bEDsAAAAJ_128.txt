A disease resistance gene analog encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR), designated RgaYr10, was previously identified at the stripe rust resistant locus, Yr10, located on chromosome 1BS distal to the storage protein, Gli-B1 locus. RgaYr10 identified gene members in the homoeologous region of chromosome 1DS cosegregating with the leaf rust resistance gene, Lr21, which originally was transferred from a diploid D genome progenitor. Four RgaYr10 gene members were isolated from chromosome 1DS and compared to two gene members previously isolated from the chromosome 1BS homeologue. NBS-LRR genes tightly linked to stripe rust resistance gene Yr10 on chromosome 1BS were closely related in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14453483825693468462", "cites_id": ["14453483825693468462"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10142-002-0074-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LidQLfYWlcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
