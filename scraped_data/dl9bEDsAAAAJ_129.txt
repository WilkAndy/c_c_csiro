Resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Erikss. and P. striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici, respectively, was investigated in 148 F5 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between \u2018Avocet\u2019 and \u2018New Pusa 876\u2019 (NP876). The parents and population were phenotyped for resistance in field trials for 3 and 2 yr for leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively, and genotyped with gene\u2010linked molecular markers. The segregation analyses indicated that the adult plant resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust was conferred by five and four additive effect genes, respectively. Among them, the slow\u2010rusting adult plant resistance gene Lr46/Yr29 reduced 14 and 16% of mean leaf rust and stripe rust severities, respectively, whereas a severity reduction of 26% occurred due to Lr67/Yr46 for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15581542761860143129", "cites_id": ["15581542761860143129"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2017.06.0396", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GZg7XZbCPNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
