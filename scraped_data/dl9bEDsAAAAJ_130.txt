Resistance similar or marginally superior to the range observed in spring wheat genotypes was readily identified. Three lines, RL5271, Aus18911, and Aus21712, were resistant to a range of pathogen isolates and were similar in resistance to a highly resistant French line, No.33. Accessions of Ae. tauschii assessed as resistant or susceptible as seedlings had corresponding reactions when tested as adult plants, with resistance being commonly expressed as restricted lesion development. Infection frequency differed between some Ae. tauschii lines. Seedling resistance in synthetic bread wheats was expressed partially or not at all depending on both the tetraploid and the tetraploid/Ae. tauschii combination. Assessment of adult responses among a range of synthetics showed occasional expression of moderate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9269774202055931172", "cites_id": ["9269774202055931172"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR01034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JLWf_YXapIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
