This chapter provides a summary of recent advances in wheat rust research. Topics include pathogen variability, host genetics, host-parasite interactions, strategies to breed for resistance to rusts, and resistance gene stewardship. The goal of wheat rust research is to achieve sustainable control of the wheat rusts to help feed our growing population, while minimizing adverse effects on the environment.Technical Abstract: This chapter provides a summary of recent advances in wheat rust research. Although the emphasis is on recent developments, some historical context is provided. Critical concepts in studying the wheat rusts are pathogen and host genetics, host-pathogen interactions, epidemiology and management strategies. The overarching goal is to use the collective knowledge of these aspects to achieve durable rust resistance through application in selection and breeding. Primarily as a result of the discovery of the broadly virulent African stem rust race \u201cUg99\u201d, and new and aggressive stripe (yellow) rust races, these, and related topics, have seen an upsurge in scientific discovery in recent years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17732201983748075788", "cites_id": ["17732201983748075788"], "pub_url": "https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=333399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DPHHRsFvFfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
