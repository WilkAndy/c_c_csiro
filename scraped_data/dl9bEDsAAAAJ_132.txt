In the primary gene pool, polymorphism for EST, AMP, SKDH was very high, as compared to the near-monomorphic isozymes of PGD. Two loci controlling leaf esterases Est-1 and Est-2, were identified in the primary gene pool. Differences in allelic frequency distribution of the polymorphic Est-1 locus occur between the cultivated and wild pearl millet. The prevalent alleles of Est-1 are absent in P. purpureum Schumach (secondary gene pool). A monomorphic band of the \u03b1-esterase-specific Est-2 locus was identified in most of the secondary gene pool accessions, P. squamulatum Fresen and an accession of P. pedicellatum.
