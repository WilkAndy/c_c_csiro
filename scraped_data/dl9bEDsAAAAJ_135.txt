Bread wheat originated from the natural synthesis of a polyploid formed between tetraploid wheat, Triticum turgidum (AABB) and the diploid species Triticum tauschii (DD; syn. Aegilops squarrosa L.) (Kihara 1944; McFadden and Sears 1944; 1946). The D set of chromosomes in the genomic composition of bread wheat are considered relatively recent additions and are less diverged from their putative donor than the A and B genomes. Although the A, B and D genomes are distinct, a varying degree of genetic similarity occurs between them. Relationships between each genomic set of the genetically equivalent chromosomes constitutes homoeologous rather than homologous groups.
