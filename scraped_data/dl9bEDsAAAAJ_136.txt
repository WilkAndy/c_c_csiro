From the progeny of four tri-parental crosses (test-crosses), HMW glutenin subunits derived from T. tauschii (Glu-D t1) segregated as alleles of the Glu-D1 locus in bread wheat. In three of the tri-parental crosses, a small proportion (2.5%) of the progeny with atypical segregation patterns, were identified through somatic chromosome counts, to be aneuploids (1.9% hypoploids and 0.6% hyperploids). Chromosomal mapping studies revealed that the synteny of genes for HMW glutenin subunits and gliadins in T. tauschii are conserved in the D genome \u2018homologue\u2019 (chromosome 1D) of T. aestivum. The map distance between the Glu-D1/-D t1 and Gli-D1/-D t1 loci was calculated to be 63.5 cM, while a linkage to the centromere of 7.7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6392677090639065914", "cites_id": ["6392677090639065914"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OrNRr_FZt1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
