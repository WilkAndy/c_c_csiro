For several decades up to and including the 1990s, it caused severe losses in southeastern Australia, where on average an 8% reduction in grain yield has been reported; although yield losses in individual fields can be more than 50%. In the late eighty\u2019s the wheat industry in Australia initiated a research program aimed at identifying new sources of CCN resistance, understanding the genetic basis of resistance, and developing efficient means of screening for CCN resistance in wheat breeding programs and carry out targeted breeding to incorporate diverse resistance genes into key cultivars and germplasm. Subsequently, we identified new sources of resistance in Aegilops tauschii (genome designation DtDt) designated Cre3, in Ae. ventricosa (DvNv) introgression lines designated Cre6 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11247558217459817369", "cites_id": ["11247558217459817369"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11247558217459817369&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mds3TptaF5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
