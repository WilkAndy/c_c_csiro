There are nine NPR1 homologues (TaNPR1) in wheat, but little research has been done to understand the function of those NPR1\u2010like genes in the wheat defence response against stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) pathogens. We used bioinformatics and reverse genetics approaches to study the expression and function of each TaNPR1. We found six members of TaNPR1 located on homoeologous group 3 chromosomes (designated as TaG3NPR1) and three on homoeologous group 7 chromosomes (designated as TaG7NPR1). The group 3 NPR1 proteins regulate transcription of SA\u2010responsive PR genes. Downregulation of all the TaNPR1 homologues via virus\u2010induced gene co\u2010silencing resulted in enhanced resistance to stem rust. More specifically downregulating TaG7NPR1 homeologues or Ta7ANPR1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3897244311497524671", "cites_id": ["3897244311497524671"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.16748", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v8W4hQ3LFTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
