The comparative genomic approach also enabled the identification of a previously uncharacterised wheat chromosome that carried Sr26.Stem rust of wheat, a biotic stress caused by a fungal pathogen, continues to pose significant threats to wheat production. Considerable effort has been directed at surveillance and breeding approaches to minimize the impact of the widely virulent race of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Pgt) commonly known as Ug99 (TTKSK) and other races in its lineage. The stem rust resistance gene Sr26, derived from Thinopyrum ponticum, is an excellent example of the successful utilization of a gene from a wild relative of a crop plant and remains one of the few durable sources of resistance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14424746814726382377", "cites_id": ["14424746814726382377"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-018-3201-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KaO2as3-LsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
