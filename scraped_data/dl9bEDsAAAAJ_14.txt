The leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 and stripe rust resistance gene Yr18 are effective at the adult plant stage and have provided moderate levels of durable resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. and to stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici. These genes have not been separated by recombination and map to chromosome 7DS in wheat. In a population of 110 F7 lines derived from a Thatcher \u00d7 Thatcher isogenic line with Lr34/Yr18, field resistance to leaf rust conferred by Lr34 and to stripe rust resistance conferred by Yr18 cosegregated with adult plant resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC) EO Speer f. sp. tritici. Lr34 and Yr18 were previously shown to be associated with enhanced stem rust resistance and tolerance to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 335, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16499222824375885088", "cites_id": ["16499222824375885088"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-005-2058-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IB3x_L0D-eQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 9, "2007": 18, "2008": 20, "2009": 19, "2010": 11, "2011": 18, "2012": 26, "2013": 30, "2014": 31, "2015": 33, "2016": 21, "2017": 20, "2018": 7, "2019": 17, "2020": 13, "2021": 20, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
