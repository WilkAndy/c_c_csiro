A recapitulation is presented of the likely genotypic and phenotypic status of the newly arisen natural hexaploid and the likely path of hybridisation from whence it arose. Recent substantial contributions of T. tauschii to wheat improvement indicate the likelihood that introgession en masse from T. tauschii has not occurred throughout its natural and agricultural associations with wheat. This has been substantiated in comparative studies revealing higher levels of genetic variation in T. tauschii compared with the D genome of hexaploid wheat. A case is made for a widening of the concept of the gene pool of T. tauschii for wheat improvement and the notion of a secondary gene pool is proposed to include variation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18121889723153793464", "cites_id": ["18121889723153793464"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/ar07352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uEFid7DiffsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
