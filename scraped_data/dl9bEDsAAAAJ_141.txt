Despite the effectiveness of genetic resistance, the deployment of single genes often compromises durability due to the emergence of virulent P. hordei races, prompting the search for new sources of resistance. Here we report on the cloning of Rph15, a resistance gene derived from barley\u2019s wild progenitor H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum. We demonstrate using introgression mapping, mutation and complementation that the Rph15 gene from the near\u2010isogenic line (NIL) Bowman + Rph15 (referred to as BW719) encodes a coiled\u2010coil nucleotide\u2010binding leucine\u2010rich repeat (NLR) protein with an integrated Zinc finger BED (ZF\u2010BED) domain. A predicted KASP marker was developed and validated across a collection of Australian cultivars and a series of introgression lines in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10606233267476528235", "cites_id": ["10606233267476528235"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.13542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a3zeaPboMJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
