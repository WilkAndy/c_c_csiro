There is an ongoing need to both diversify and genetically characterise resistance loci to provide effective and durable control given the ongoing threat of rapidly evolving P. hordei populations. Here, we report on the molecular genetic characterisation of the Rph13 locus, originally derived from wild barley and transferred to barley accession Berac (then referred to as PI 531849). The 2017 reference genome of cv. Morex was used as a road map to rapidly narrow both a genetic and physical intervals around the Rph13 resistance locus.
