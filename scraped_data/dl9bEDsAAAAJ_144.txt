Improving salinity tolerance of wheat is a key target for many wheat breeding programs worldwide. Amongst the synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHWs)(2n= 6x= 42, AABBDD) derived from crosses between Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (2n= 4x= 28, genome AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (syn Ae. squarrose, T. tauschii; 2n= 2x= 14, genome DD), significant variation was observed for salinity tolerance. To investigate natural allelic variants contributing to quantitative variation for salinity tolerance in hexaploid wheat, a quantitative trait mapping approach was used to analyse a population of BC1F5 synthetic-derived backcrossed lines (SBLs) derived from crossing SHWs to bread wheat. The SBLs were screened for salinity tolerance based on the sodium exclusion mechanism. QTLs were detected on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 3D, 4B, 4D, 6D, 7A and 7D that were significantly associated with sodium exclusion. Of these, only the chromosome 4D region has previously been reported as associated with sodium exclusion in bread wheat and thereby contributing to salt tolerance (Dubcovsky et al. 1996). The SBLs proved to be a promising tool to identify, characterize and introgress different salinity tolerance genes into adapted wheat genetic backgrounds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10210633518044798960", "cites_id": ["10210633518044798960"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3300/P197.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8N_BHhZ1s40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
