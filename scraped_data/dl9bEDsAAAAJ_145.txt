SDS\u2013PAGE analysis detected three avenin loci, AveX, AveY, and AveZ, closely linked to Pc68. Their diagnostic alleles are linked in coupling to Pc68 and were also detected in three additional lines carrying Pc68. Another protein locus was linked in repulsion to Pc68. In complementary studies, three wheat RGA clones (W2, W4, and W10) detected restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible F3 DNA bulks. Four oat homologues of W2 were cloned and sequenced. RFLPs detected with two of them were mapped using F3 and F4 populations. Clone 18 detected a locus, Orga2, linked in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16172446902424065381", "cites_id": ["16172446902424065381"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g11-014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZVXav8UScOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
