Host plant responses associated with resistance to the disease were determined in 2 cultivars of subterranean clover (T. subterraneum) separately inoculated with K. caulivora Race 1 or Race 2. Germination of conidia of both races reached a maximum 5 days post-inoculation on cv. Woogenellup (susceptible to both races) and 4 days post-inoculation on cv. Daliak (resistant to Race 1 but susceptible to Race 2). Germ tube growth of Race 1 was inhibited on cv. Daliak and the percentage of conidia penetrating leaf surfaces was lowest on this race\u2013cultivar combination. Susceptibility was characterised by large petiole lesions, with invasive hyphae extending through the mesophyll tissue into the pith and then through the phloem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11085013699648651635", "cites_id": ["11085013699648651635"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar01093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c4HlmTrh1ZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
