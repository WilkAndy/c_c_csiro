Woogenellup was inoculated with K. caulivora, to study the attachment and germination of conidia, germ\u2010tube penetration of the plant surface, and histochemistry and ultrastructure of changes in the host associated with lesion development. The foliar architecture caused the conidia to concentrate at the base of leaflets and on the petiolules (between the leaflets and petioles). Epidermal cells immediately beneath conidia and, occasionally, also adjacent cells developed a yellow\u2010brown discoloration 1\u2003day post\u2010inoculation. Penetration appeared to be directly through the cuticle, characterized by constricted hyphae at the point of entry. No appressoria were observed. In leaves, invasion was restricted to the area proximal to the petiolule and leaf mid\u2010rib. In petioles and petiolules, the hyphae initially remained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7824292714475145843", "cites_id": ["7824292714475145843"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1439-0434.2001.00699.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c8r32MR4lWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
