Three DNA based markers were evaluated in marker assisted selection aimed at the facilitating their use in combining various disease resistance sources in wheat breeding program. CD2. 2 was identified as completely linked with the Crel resistance gene and in combination with a PCR based assay were used to select for plants carrying both Crel and Cre3 genes in the wheat breeding program.INTRODUCTION: Cereal cyst nematode, Heterodera avenae, is considered one of the most economically important disease of temperate cereals worldwide, and in some areas of Australia upto 5\u20138% reduction in yield has been reported. The most cost effective control measure is by the use of genetic resistance. Resistance genes which include the Crel gene from wheat as well as those derived from wheat relatives (Cre2 or X, 3, 4 and CreR) have been reported.
