However, haplotyping using the cloned Lr34/Yr18 diagnostic marker and the complete sequencing of the gene indicated Lr34/Yr18 is absent in RL6077. We crossed RL6077 with the susceptible parent \u2018Avocet\u2019 and developed F3, F4 and F6 populations from photoperiod-insensitive F3 lines that were segregating for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust. The populations were characterized for leaf rust resistance at two Mexican sites, Cd. Obregon during the 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010 crop seasons, and El Batan during 2009, and for stripe rust resistance at Toluca, a third Mexican site, during 2009. The F3 population was also evaluated for stripe rust \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 314, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15892682453356146843", "cites_id": ["15892682453356146843"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-010-1439-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m3BgAH0mjtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 11, "2012": 19, "2013": 30, "2014": 40, "2015": 29, "2016": 20, "2017": 36, "2018": 18, "2019": 18, "2020": 31, "2021": 28, "2022": 24, "2023": 10}}
