To better define and understand this diversity, we sequenced 242 Ae. tauschii accessions and compared them to the wheat D-subgenome. We characterized a rare, geographically-restricted lineage of Ae. tauschii and discovered that it contributed to the wheat D-subgenome, thereby elucidating the origin of bread wheat from at least two independent hybridizations. We then used k-mer-based association mapping to identify discrete genomic regions with candidate genes for disease and pest resistance and demonstrated their functional transfer into wheat by transgenesis and wide crossing, including the generation of a library of \u2018synthetic\u2019 hexaploids incorporating diverse Ae. tauschii genomes. This pipeline permits rapid trait discovery in the diploid ancestor through to functional genetic validation in a hexaploid background amenable to breeding."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4722563090606797963", "cites_id": ["4722563090606797963"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.31.428788.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:izT9FBzqiUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
