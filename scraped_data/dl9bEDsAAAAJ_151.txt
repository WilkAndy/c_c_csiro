Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is responsible for major production losses around the world. The development of resistant cultivars is an effective and environmentally friendly way to manage the disease, but outbreaks can occur when new pathogen races overcome the existing host resistance genes. Ug99 (race TTKSK) and related Pgt races are virulent to the majority of existing cultivars, which presents a potential threat to global wheat production. The hexaploid wheat cultivar Canthatch has long been known to carry a suppressor of stem rust resistance on chromosome arm 7DL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11946479740719067067", "cites_id": ["11946479740719067067"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-015-2514-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u-_1bQdsyqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
