Many disease resistance phenotypes are partial rather than obvious immunity and are frequently scored using subjective qualitative estimates of pathogen development or plant disease symptoms. Here we report a method for the accurate comparison of total fungal biomass in plant tissues. This method, called the WAC assay, is based upon the specific binding of the plant lectin wheat germ agglutinin to fungal chitin. The assay is simple, high-throughput, and sensitive enough to discriminate between single Puccinia graminis f.sp tritici infection sites on a wheat leaf segment. It greatly lends itself to replication as large volumes of tissue can be pooled from independent experiments and assayed to provide truly representative quantification, or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=571558673031002531", "cites_id": ["571558673031002531"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-62703-986-4_13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o3lOupWV7gcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
