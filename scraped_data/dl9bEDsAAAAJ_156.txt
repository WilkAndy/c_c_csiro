Variability within and between K. caulivora Race 1 and Race 2 was determined by cultural characteristics, isozymes, and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). Cultural studies indicated isolates from both races were highly variable. No differences were identified within or between races by isozyme analysis. Similarity coefficients, determined from AFLP analysis, indicated that isolates from different races were often more similar than isolates from the same race. Comparison of single representative isolates from Race 1 and Race 2, collected at a Denmark (Western Australia) disease site, with isolates collected from another site of clover scorch outbreak at Esperance, 300 km east of Denmark, indicated most of the isolates causing the second outbreak were similar to Race 2, confirming previously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14530329354386153587,16830489548415530003", "cites_id": ["14530329354386153587", "16830489548415530003"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar02071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cyCeFZAZpskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
