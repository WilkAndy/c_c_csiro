The electrophoretic survey revealed similar albumin subunits, a distinct group of globulin subunits associated with P. schweinfurthii Pilger, and interspecific differences based on prolamin composition. Prolamin polymorphism was much higher in wild than in cultivated pearl millet, and a varying degree of gene exchange was found to occur between them. Components of a monomorphic class of prolamins, designated A1 A2, B1 and B2 associated with the primary gene pool were identified in some accessions of P. purpureum Schumach (secondary gene pool). P. squamulatum Fresen., a tertiary gene pool species, was observed to possess all the monomorphic prolamln bands of the primary gene pool.
