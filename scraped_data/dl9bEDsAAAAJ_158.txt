The activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and soluble peroxidase were determined in seedling leaves of two cultivars of subterranean clover (T. subterraneum) inoculated with race 1 or race 2 of K. caulivora. A small increase in activity of PAL was recorded in both cultivars 2\u20134 h post inoculation with either race. A second, large increase in PAL activity was observed only in the incompatible interaction (cv. Daliak inoculated with race 1), increasing 18-fold between 8 and 48 h post inoculation. Peroxidase activity in cv. Daliak increased rapidly within 2 h post inoculation with either race but was significantly higher in the incompatible interaction. Peroxidase activity in cv. Woogenellup increased by 4 h post inoculation with either race, but was significantly lower than that in cv. Daliak.
