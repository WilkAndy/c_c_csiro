Markers closely linked with Sr63 were developed.An F3 population from a Glossy Huguenot (GH)/Bansi cross used in a previous Australian study was advanced to F6 for molecular mapping of adult plant stem rust resistance. Maturity differences among F6 lines confounded assessments of stem rust response. GH was crossed with a stem rust susceptible F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL), GHB14 (M14), with similar maturity and an F6:7 population was developed through single seed descent method. F7 and F8 RILs were tested along with the parents at different locations. The F6 individual plants and both parents were genotyped using the 90 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) wheat array.
