Using wheat-rye translocation and recombinant lines, molecular markers were isolated and mapped within chromosomal regions of 1RS carrying rust resistance genes Lr26, Sr31, Yr9 from 'Petkus' and SrR from 'Imperial' rye. RFLP markers previously mapped to chromosome 1HS of barley \u2013 flanking the complex Mla powdery mildew resistance gene locus \u2013 and chromosome 1DS of Aegilops tauschii \u2013 flanking the Sr33 stem rust resistance gene \u2013 were shown to map on either side of rust resistance genes on 1RS. Three non cross-hybridising Resistance Gene Analog markers, one of them being derived from the Mla gene family, were mapped within same region of 1RS. PCR-based markers were developed which were tightly linked to the rust resistance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 306, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7397343833527252625", "cites_id": ["7397343833527252625"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-002-0879-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kXbRFgalqGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 8, "2006": 12, "2007": 9, "2008": 20, "2009": 15, "2010": 11, "2011": 12, "2012": 19, "2013": 13, "2014": 28, "2015": 24, "2016": 22, "2017": 15, "2018": 18, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 21, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
