Race-specific resistance (R) genes have been deployed widely; however, their durability is often compromised due to the rapid emergence of virulent P. hordei races, prompting the search for new sources of broad-spectrum resistance. Here we report on the cloning of Rph15, a broadly effective resistance gene derived from the wild progenitor Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum. We demonstrate using introgression mapping, mutation and complementation that Rph15 encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein with an integrated Zinc-finger BED (ZF-BED) domain. The allelic variation at the Rph15 locus was assessed using barley exome capture data that traced its origin to the western region of the Fertile Crescent bordering Jordan and Israel. To unravel the genetic relationship of two other leaf rust resistance genes (Rph14 and Rph16) mapped at similar locus on chromosome 2H, we re-sequenced the Rph15 gene from the near-isogenic line for Rph15 (Bowman+Rph15) and the two donor accessions of Rph14 (PI 584760) and Rph16, (PI 405292, Hs 680). Both whole genome and Sanger sequencing confirmed that Hs 680 carried Rph15, while Rph14 in PI 584760 was an independent locus. A perfect diagnostic KASP marker was developed and validated to permit efficient introduction of Rph15 into cultivated barley."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15453664489014627400", "cites_id": ["15453664489014627400"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.19.911446.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SAzJyflxdtYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
