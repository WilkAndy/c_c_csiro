The tetraploid wheats and the synthetic hexaploids reached ear emergence 50\u00b73 to 63\u00b78 d and 58\u00b72 to 75\u00b73 d after sowing, respectively, while the T. tauschii lines reached ear emergence 114\u00b73 to 179\u00b75 d after sowing.The spring habit of the synthetic hexaploids demonstrates the epistasis of spring over winter habit.
