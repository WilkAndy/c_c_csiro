Atil C2000 is moderately susceptible to leaf rust at adult plant stage and displays severities of 20\u201360%. These two durum wheats were crossed with the susceptible line Atred#1, and the respective recombinant inbred line populations were phenotyped for resistance to leaf rust in field trials in four environments in Mexico. The phenotypic segregation in the Atred#1 \u00d7 Atil C2000 population was attributed to the pleiotropic adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr46 based on the closest marker cslv46G22 located within 1.4 cM. Lr46 reduced leaf rust severity by 19.6\u201335.5%, and it was also identified in the Atred#1 \u00d7 Quetru population, where it reduced leaf rust severity by 28.5\u201357.7% depending on the environment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15625417200061597305", "cites_id": ["15625417200061597305"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11032-019-1024-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eUbzDCii2NgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
