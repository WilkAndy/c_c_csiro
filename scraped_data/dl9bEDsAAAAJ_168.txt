We determined the genetic basis of resistance to LR and YR in variety Borlaug 100 by developing and phenotyping a population of 198 F6 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross with the susceptible parent Apav#1. LR and YR phenotyping were conducted for 4 and 3 seasons, respectively, at CIMMYT research stations in Mexico under artificial epidemics. Mendelian segregation analyses indicated that 3\u20135 LR and 2 YR genes conferred resistance in Borlaug 100. Lr46/Yr29 (1BL), Yr17 (2AS) and Yr30 (3BS) were present in the resistant parent and segregated in the RIL population based on characterization by molecular markers linked to these genes. When present alone, Lr46/Yr29 caused average 13 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13617401356035012704", "cites_id": ["13617401356035012704"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214514121001604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YLhjnmK6-rwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
