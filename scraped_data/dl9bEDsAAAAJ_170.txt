A cross was made between the resistant Ae. tauschii accession, AUS21712, and a susceptible accession, CPI110889, to study the genetics of resistance. The parental accessions and the F1, F3, and F4 progeny were screened in the glasshouse as seedlings. The resistant parent took significantly longer to develop symptoms, developed significantly fewer lesions, and expressed significantly lower levels of disease than the susceptible parent. The F1 mean response for disease severity indicated resistance was dominant. The genotypic ratios generated from the screening of the F3 and F4 generations were not significantly different from the genotypic ratio expected for a single gene. The efficacy of the resistance and its simple genetic control in the Ae. tauschii accession AUS21712 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2191875054764241055", "cites_id": ["2191875054764241055"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR01035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nzBDz78aax4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
