This previously well controlled disease, caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, has reemerged as a major threat to wheat cultivation. The stem rust (Sr) resistance gene Sr22 encodes a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor which confers resistance to the highly virulent African stem rust isolate Ug99. Here, we show that the Sr22 gene is conserved among grasses in the Triticeae and Poeae lineages. Triticeae species contain syntenic loci with single-copy orthologs of Sr22 on chromosome 7, except Hordeum vulgare, which has experienced major expansions and rearrangements at the locus. We also describe 14 Sr22 sequence variants obtained from both Triticum boeoticum and the domesticated form of this species, T. monococcum, which have been postulated to encode both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8119827546821897874", "cites_id": ["8119827546821897874"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-01-20-0018-R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ki7AFSJsr3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
