This locus has contributed towards durable resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust, stem rust and powdery mildew, making Lr34 a unique resource for breeding and a model for understanding the molecular basis of partial horizontal resistance. Lr34 has been used in breeding programs since many decades and has not been overcome. A detailed QTL study mapped this gene to the short arm of chromosome 7D (Schnurbusch et al. 2004). The gene explained up to 42% of the phenotypic variance observed in the field. Lr34 is associated with the morphological marker \u2018Leaf Tip Necrosis\u2019(Ltn1). Ltn1 can be used as a morphological marker to assist breeding for Lr34 (Figure1), but is limited by variable expression under different environmental conditions and genetic background."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12371667592324870632", "cites_id": ["12371667592324870632"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3200/O32.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6HG8lyD-sKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2}}
