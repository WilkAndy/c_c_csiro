Sr2 was fine mapped to a small genetic interval on chromosome 3BS in a cross between \u2018Chinese Spring\u2019(Lr31) and Chinese Spring with 3B chromosome substitution from \u2018Hope\u2019(Sr2, Lr27). Previously, complementary race-specific leaf rust resistance genes Lr27 and Lr31 were positioned on 3BS and 4BS, respectively and the presence of Lr27 was associated with Sr2 in many cultivars. A high resolution Sr2 mapping family was derived from over 3000 gametes and scored for Lr27. Seedling leaf rust resistance with Lr27 specificity cosegregated with Sr2 suggesting that a single gene may confer race specific leaf rust and non-race specific, adult plant stem rust resistance in wheat.Tight linkage was reported previously between Lr34 and stripe rust resistance gene Yr18 and powdery mildew resistance gene Pm38. We recently demonstrated that Lr34 was also tightly linked to adult-plant stem rust resistance using a high resolution mapping family in the \u2018Thatcher\u2019background. Seed of the near-isogenic Thatcher line RL6058 carrying Lr34 were treated with sodium azide. Twelve mutants susceptible to leaf rust and stripe rust in the field were recovered. These mutants were also susceptible to stem rust and powdery mildew in the adult plant stage. Allelism tests between some of the mutants confirmed that the mutation events occurred at the Lr34 locus suggesting that a single gene confers resistance to three rust pathogens and powdery mildew. Because several wheat cultivars carrying Lr34 are susceptible to stem rust, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5425236413646649047", "cites_id": ["5425236413646649047"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3176/P162.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1zbsKcZPSksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
