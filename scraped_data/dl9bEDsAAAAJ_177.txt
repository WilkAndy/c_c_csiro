Bread wheat originated from the natural synthesis of a polyploid formed between tetraploid wheat, T. turgidum (AABB), and the diploid species T. tauschii (DD)(Kihara, 1944; McFadden & Sears, 1946; see Fig. 8.1). Throughout this chapter, species names of the Triticineae subtribe used by Morris & Sears (1967) have been adopted. The chromosomes of the D genome of bread wheat are considered relatively"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6230784509937281889", "cites_id": ["6230784509937281889"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dtY9AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA225&dq=info:YWvR6n8xeFYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=pnhEZlCqxI&sig=zaX3uIrylkTZQ8ejJlBPgXF61mU", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YWvR6n8xeFYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
