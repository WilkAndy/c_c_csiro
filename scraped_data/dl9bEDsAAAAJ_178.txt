In T. dicoccoides, band 45 was either present or not and 42 was always absent. In its \u2018grassy\u2019 and intermediate growth habit forms, (believed to be more primitieve than the cercal forms) band 45 appeared to be more frequent than in the cereal form.The presence of band 45 in the Ae. sharonensis, and its relatively high frequency in T. dicoccoides, populations from Mt. Hermon (likely to be relatively free from introgression from cultivated tetraploid wheat) indicate the likelihood of a primary origin of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5476293123257548425", "cites_id": ["5476293123257548425"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00021124", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iT6uuZSz_0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2}}
