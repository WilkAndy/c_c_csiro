The synthetic hexaploid wheat line Largo (pedigree: durum wheat \u201cLangdon\u201d \u00d7 Aegilops tauschii PI 268210) was found to have resistance to a broad spectrum of Pgt races including the Ug99 race group. To identify the stem rust resistance (Sr) genes, we genotyped a population of 188 recombinant inbred lines developed from a cross between the susceptible wheat line ND495 and Largo using the wheat Infinium 90\u2009K SNP iSelect array and evaluated the population for seedling resistance to the Pgt races TTKSK, TRTTF, and TTTTF in the greenhouse conditions. Based on genetic linkage analysis using the marker and rust data, we identified six quantitative trait loci (QTL) with effectiveness against different races. Three QTL on chromosome arms 6AL, 2BL, and 2BS corresponded to Sr genes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18185828661112998171", "cites_id": ["18185828661112998171"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/11/8/jkab193/6292116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GwnCi9AKYfwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
