Previous mapping studies using an Avocet-YrA/Parula recombinant inbred line (RIL) population showed that APR to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) in Parula is governed by at least three independent slow rusting resistance genes: Lr34 on 7DS, Lr46 on 1BL, and a previously unknown gene on 7BL. The use of field rust reaction and flanking markers identified two F6 RILs, Arula1 and Arula2, from the above population that lacked Lr34 and Lr46 but carried the leaf rust resistance gene in 7BL, hereby designated Lr68. Arula1 and Arula2 were crossed with Apav, a highly susceptible line from the cross Avocet-YrA/Pavon 76, and 396 F4-derived F5 RILs were developed for mapping Lr68. The RILs were phenotyped for leaf rust resistance for over 2 years in Ciudad Obregon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 290, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13908728022528706072", "cites_id": ["13908728022528706072"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-012-1802-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GEZY5HG6BcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 23, "2014": 33, "2015": 31, "2016": 19, "2017": 35, "2018": 21, "2019": 24, "2020": 25, "2021": 29, "2022": 31, "2023": 12}}
