However, it is unclear whether the suppressor also suppresses resistance genes against leaf rust and stripe rust. In this study, we investigated the specificity of the resistance suppression. To determine whether the suppression is genome origin specific, chromosome location specific, or rust species or race specific, we introduced 11 known rust resistance genes into the Canthatch background, including resistance to leaf, stripe, or stem rusts, originating from A, B, or D genomes and located on different chromosome homologous groups. F1 plants of each cross were tested with the corresponding rust race, and the infection types were scored and compared with the parents. Our results show that the Canthatch 7DL suppressor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8608211971867937022", "cites_id": ["8608211971867937022"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-09-14-0261-R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_gh0Hi6DdncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
