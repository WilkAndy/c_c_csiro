Methodologies used to characterize the protein encoded by Lr67 may be of use to non-transporter experts conducting similar experiments with other hexose transporters. Hence, in this chapter, we detail a protocol for the functional characterization of hexose transporter proteins in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system. We also provide guidance on the use of metabolic inhibitors and competing sugars to probe transporter structural features, energization, and specificity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16815598405599972742", "cites_id": ["16815598405599972742"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7249-4_23", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hk1pM6gBXekJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
