The broad-spectrum resistance of the mutant was characterized by a microscopy study and additional race screenings of two rust pathogens. The mutant displayed less disease severity in response to all the races tested, when compared with the wild-type. The microscopy study of the pathogenesis of a leaf rust race PBJJG on the mutant revealed that the resistance was first evident at the pre-haustorial stage; formation of haustoria was significantly delayed or inhibited in the mutant compared with the wild-type. The mutant displayed microscopic level of cell death even in the absence of any pathogens. These findings suggest that MNR220 mediates a spontaneous cell death that delays the infection process by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2974333517655028616", "cites_id": ["2974333517655028616"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07060661.2016.1205663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iLNdW5P0RikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
