Research on effector-based immunity which is mediated by major resistance (R) genes has been greatly stimulated by the molecular isolation of plant resistance genes as well as the first fungal effectors. In addition, the first genes underlying QTLs or partial disease resistance have been cloned. However, much of this work is still in a phase of basic research and there is a need for translational approaches to realize the globally needed improvements of disease resistance in wheat. In particular, it is essential that future strategies are aiming at achieving durable resistance against pathogens. Durable resistance has been defined by Johnson (Genetic background of durable resistance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3941392797829126892", "cites_id": ["3941392797829126892"], "pub_url": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27833/1002172.pdf?sequence=1#page=350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7FrjAt6jsjYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
