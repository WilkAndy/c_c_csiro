They reported that all Lr34 containing wheat cultivars were susceptible to leaf rust in their field experiment and concluded that Lr34 is ineffective in Turkish wheat cultivars. According to the authors this \u2018erosion\u2019of Lr34 resistance might be caused by new leaf rust races that have overcome this resistance gene. In our opinion however, the phenotypic data presented in this study are inadequate to assess partial disease resistance. Much more careful field trials and additional data would be needed to rule out additional explanations and to support the claim of \u2018ineffectiveness\u2019 of Lr34 in Turkish wheat cultivars.Lr34 is one of the most important disease resistance genes in wheat breeding because it confers durable and race non-specific protection against several fungal diseases. The effect of Lr34 is partial, resulting in longer latency periods and reduced infection frequency. This phenotype is also named \u2018slow rusting\u2019. Towards the end of the growing season, even Lr34 containing wheat cultivars can show disease symptoms. Under high disease pressure and in environments that favour disease development, Lr34 alone might confer insufficient protection and Lr34 containing cultivars might be misclassified as susceptible. Hence, extreme care must be taken in field trials to adequately phenotype wheat cultivars with partial resistance. To adequately judge the effectiveness of partial resistance genes, wheat cultivars need to be evaluated during several field seasons ideally at different locations.
