Reported average losses across the wheat crop are about AU $30\u201340 million annually. Less than 2% of current Australian wheat cultivars possess resistance. We focus on the potential of Ae. tauschii. In Australia the potential area for dryland salinity\u201d is estimated at 5.7 million hectares, and forecast to reach 17 million ha by 2050. At present, efforts are underway to transfer salinity tolerance from synthetic hexaploid (SH) to develop superior salt tolerant wheat germplasm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6900996603140328086,13522377158490818721", "cites_id": ["6900996603140328086", "13522377158490818721"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/1-4020-5497-1_47.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lkpb9thDxV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
