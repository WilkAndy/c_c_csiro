In the experiment L-2, two rounds of size selection of DNA between 200 and 300 kb from pulse field gels were used in the ligation. This resulted in a high total number of clones 500,000) with an relatively small average insert size (94 kb). An additional third round of size selection step between 125 and 200 kb in the experiments L-1 and R-1 reduced the total number"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12127588474356872975", "cites_id": ["12127588474356872975"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12127588474356872975&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D7cpdHbZTagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2}}
