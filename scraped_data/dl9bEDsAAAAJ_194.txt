The degree of polymorphism in T. tauschii (Dt) for these characters occurred in the order: Est-Dt5 < Glu-Dt1 < Gli-Dt2 < Gli-Dt1. Although polymorphism for these traits was quite high, particularly the endosperm storage protein markers, only a limited number of variant forms for each trait was closely matched to their analogous variants in the D genome of hexaploid wheat. Of the 79 T. tauschii accessions used in the study, only three var. strangulate accessions showed consistent homology with all the prevalent allelic forms of the Est-D5, Glu-D1 and Gli-D1 gene loci of hexaploid wheat.      Genetic studies of the Est-Dt5, Gli-Dt1, Gli-Dt2 and Glu-Dt1 loci showed that variant forms at each locus segregated as a single Mendelian character. Chromosomal mapping studies revealed that the synteny of genes for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits and gliadins in T. tauschii are conserved in the D genome 'homologue' (chromosome 1D) of T. aestivum.
