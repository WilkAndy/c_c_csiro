(Pst). Here, we show that CPI110672, an Aegilopstauschii accession from Turkmenistan, carries a single Pst resistance gene, YrAet672, that is effective against multiple Pst pathotypes, including the four predominant Pst lineages present in Australia. The YRAet672 locus was fine mapped to the short arm of chromosome 4D, and a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat gene was identified at the locus.
