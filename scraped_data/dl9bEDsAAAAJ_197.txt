This study was conducted to identify the stem rust resistance (Sr) gene(s) in both accessions. Genetic analysis of the resistance in RL 5271 identified a single dominant allele (SrRL5271) controlling resistance, whereas resistance segregated at two loci (SR672.1 and SR672.2) for a cross of CPI110672. Bulked segregant analysis placed SrRL5271 and Sr672.1 in a region on chromosome arm 2DS that encodes Sr46 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10590930257951592994", "cites_id": ["10590930257951592994"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-022-04132-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IhIk2vSK-pIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
