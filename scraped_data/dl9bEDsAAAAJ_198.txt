Resistant cultivars offer long-term control and reduces the use of hazardous chemicals, which can be detrimental to both human health and environment. Land races have been a valuable resource for mining new genes for various abiotic and biotic stresses including wheat rusts. Afghan wheat landrace \u201cKU3067\u201d displayed high seedling infection type (IT) for leaf rust and low IT for stripe rust; however, it displayed high levels of field resistance for both rusts when tested for multiple seasons against Mexican rust isolates. The current study focused on identifying loci conferring seedling resistance to stripe rust, as well as loci conferring adult plant resistance (APR) against Mexican races of leaf and stripe rust. A backcrossed inbred line (BIL) population advanced to the BC1F5 generation derived from the cross of KU3067 and Apav (triple rust susceptible line) was used for both, inheritance and QTL mapping studies. The population and parents were genotyped with Diversity Arrays Technology-genotyping-by-sequencing (DArT-Seq) and phenotyped for leaf and stripe rust response at both seedling and adult plant stages during multiple seasons in Mexico with relevant pathotypes. Mapping results identified an all-stage resistance gene for stripe rust, temporarily designated as YrKU, on chromosome 7BL. Six QTL conferring APR to leaf rust on 1AS, 2AL, 4DL, 6BL, 7AL, and 7BL, and four QTL for stripe rust resistance on 1BS, 2AL, 4DL, and 7BL were detected in the analyses. Among these, pleiotropic gene Lr67/Yr46 on 4DL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8473847449019077842", "cites_id": ["8473847449019077842"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.894528/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0tShx1snmXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
