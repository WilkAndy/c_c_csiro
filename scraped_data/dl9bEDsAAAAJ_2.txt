This requires new genetic sources of salt tolerance, and more efficient techniques for identifying salt-tolerant germplasm, so that new genes for tolerance can be introduced into crop cultivars. Screening a large number of genotypes for salt tolerance is not easy. Salt tolerance is achieved through the control of salt movement into and through the plant, and salt-specific effects on growth are seen only after long periods of time. Early effects on growth and metabolism are likely due to osmotic effects of the salt, that is to the salt in the soil solution. To avoid the necessity of growing plants for long periods of time to measure biomass or yield, practical selection techniques can be based on physiological traits. We illustrate this with current work on durum wheat, on selection for the trait of sodium exclusion.
