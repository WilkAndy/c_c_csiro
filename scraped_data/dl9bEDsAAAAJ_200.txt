Sujata and NP876 possess adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and display final rust severities of 10-15% and 15-20%, respectively, compared to 100% severity for the susceptible check Avocet in field trials conducted in Mexico. Sujata was highly resistant (1 MR) to stripe rust in the field and displayed intermediate infection types in seedling greenhouse tests. NP876 was susceptible to stripe rust in seedling tests, but displayed APR in field trials with 5-10% severity compared to 100% severity for Avocet. We developed 148 F5 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) mapping populations for each of the Avocet\u00d7 Sujata and Avocet\u00d7 NP876 crosses and phenotyped them for leaf rust reaction at Mexican field sites El Batan and Cd. Obregon during 2011-2013 and for stripe rust at Toluca during 2011 and 2012. Genetic analyses indicated the presence of three and five additive genes for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2337958274190428167", "cites_id": ["2337958274190428167"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2337958274190428167&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B0jO0KkYciAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
