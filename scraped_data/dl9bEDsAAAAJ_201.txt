While rice and maize improvement is profiting already from information derived from genome sequences, wheat is lagging behind without a genome sequence project underway. Physical maps anchored to genetic maps are the substrate for genome sequencing and they provide efficient tools for marker development, map-based cloning, QTL mapping, as well as for structural, functional, and comparative genomics studies. In the framework of the IWGSC, we have developed a physical map of chromosome 3B and established the proof of concept for physical mapping of the 21 bread wheat chromosomes through a chromosome-based approach. The 3B physical map consists of 1036 contigs with an average size of 783 kb that cover 811 Mb ie 82% of the chromosome with about~ 10x coverage. The physical map was anchored to deletion and genetic maps with 1443 markers thereby providing a framework for efficient map-based cloning and marker development through BAC-end and contig sequencing. The 3B physical map is currently used for map-based cloning, recombination and LD studies as well as to analyse the wheat genome composition, organisation, function and evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4937239307132843528", "cites_id": ["4937239307132843528"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3398/O22.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CLa_wP2YhEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
