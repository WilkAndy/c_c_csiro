However, Pm8 when challenged by avirulent Blumeria graminis tritici cultures is not expressed in all wheat genetic backgrounds. According to Ren et al. the dominant suppressor of Pm8 is located in close proximity to the Gli-A1/Glu-A3 loci on chromosome 1AS. These loci are closely linked with the Pm3 locus. Different selections of Veery and Bobwhite vary in response to powdery mildew even though they have the 1BL. 1RS translocation. F2-derived F5 populations developed from crosses between resistant and susceptible (suppressed) selections of each cultivar segregated for response to powdery mildew and resistance in some segregating lines was recessive (dominant inhibition). These populations were subjected to analysis with functional markers for Gli-A3 and Pm3. We have shown that wheats lacking a Pm3 powdery mildew response either possessed a functional transcribed allele (eg Chinese Spring which lacked a known Pm3 resistance specificity), a terminated allele, or were null. Our analyses indicate that lines with functional alleles of Pm3, including the Chinese Spring allele, show suppression of Pm8, which we presume to be an orthologue of Pm3. We are developing transient assays to test our prediction that Pm8 will not function when combined with functional Pm3 alleles, and also combining the translocation in lines with Pm3 alleles. We know of no wheat genotype with 1BL. 1RS and a named Pm3 resistance allele.This work has important implications in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5564110040452147527", "cites_id": ["5564110040452147527"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3413/P138.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R6lVFJqwN00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
