The disease has been present in Australia since 1979 but was not detected in Western Australia until 2002 (Wellings et. al. 2003). Consequently there had been comparatively little prior selection of Western Australian wheat breeding germplasm for resistance to stripe rust and limited knowledge of the extent and type of resistance present in locally adapted germplasm.The commercial variety Wyalkatchem (Machete/Gutha.. 2* Jacup. 11ISEPTON135) is the major wheat variety in Western Australia, estimated to represent 30% of wheat area sown in 2007/08. Wyalkatchem possesses partial resistance and understanding its genetic control will assist breeding to improve stripe rust resistance and adaptation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=218545119696821581", "cites_id": ["218545119696821581"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3459/P133.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TZ3s4qBtCAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
