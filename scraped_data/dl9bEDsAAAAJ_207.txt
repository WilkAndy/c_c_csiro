The CIMMYT advanced wheat line \u201cMucuy\u201d displayed high levels of resistance to stripe rust (YR) and leaf rust (LR) in field evaluations in Mexico and several other countries. To determine the genetic basis of YR and LR resistance, 138 F5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Apav#1\u00d7 Mucuy were phenotyped for YR responses from 2015 to 2020 at field sites in India, Kenya, and Mexico and for LR in Mexico. Using 12,681 polymorphic molecular markers from the DArT, SNP, and SSR genotyping platforms, we constructed genetic linkage maps and QTL analyses detected seven YR and four LR resistance loci. Among these, a co-located YR/LR resistance loci was identified as Yr29/Lr46 and a seedling stripe rust resistance gene YrMu was mapped on the 2AS/2NS translocation. This fragment also conferred moderate adult plant resistance (APR) under all Mexican field environments and in one season in Kenya. Field trial phenotyping with Lr37-virulent Puccinia triticina races indicated the presence of an APR QTL accounting for 18.3-25.5% of the LR severity variation, in addition to a novel YR resistance QTL, QYr.cim-3DS, derived from Mucuy. We developed breeder-friendly KASP and indel molecular markers respectively for Yr29/Lr46 and YrMu. The current study validated the presence of known genes and identified new resistance loci, QTL combinations effect, and flanking markers to facilitate accelerated breeding for genetically complex \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4936715970048449267", "cites_id": ["4936715970048449267"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.880138/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:81q81wS9gkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
