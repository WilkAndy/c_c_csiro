The development of molecular techniques for genetic analysis, in particular the use of molecular markers to monitor DNA sequence variation between varieties, landraces, and wild relatives of wheat and related grass species, has led to a dramatic expansion in our understanding of wheat genetics and the structure and behaviour of the wheat genome. This review provides an overview of these developments, examines some of the special issues that have arisen in applying molecular techniques to genetic studies in wheat, and looks at the applications of these technologies to wheat breeding and to improving our understanding of the genetic basis of traits such as disease resistance and processing quality. The review also attempts to foreshadow some of the key molecular issues and developments that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 264, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8007704963878635966", "cites_id": ["8007704963878635966"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR01082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vkke7jwVIW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 8, "2005": 23, "2006": 19, "2007": 22, "2008": 9, "2009": 12, "2010": 17, "2011": 11, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 10, "2018": 21, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
