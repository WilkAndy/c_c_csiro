Deployment of cultivars incorporating genetic resistance, such as adult plant resistance (APR) or all-stage resistance (ASR), is considered the most sustainable control method. APR is preferred, which places lower selection pressure on the pathogen and is often polygenic, thus considered more durable. In the search for new sources of APR, here we explored a diversity panel sourced from the NI Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR). Based on DNA marker screening, 83 of the 300 accessions were deemed to carry known APR genes, namely Lr34, Lr46, and Lr67. Interestingly, accessions carrying Lr67 were mostly landraces from India and Pakistan, reconfirming the likely origin of the gene.
