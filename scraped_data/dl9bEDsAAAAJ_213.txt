One group represents the so called seedling resistance or the \u2018gene for gene\u2019class that often provides strong resistance to some but not all strains of a rust species. The other category referred to as adult plant resistance provide partial resistance that is expressed in adult plants during the critical grain filling stage of wheat development. A few seedling rust resistance genes have been cloned in wheat and other cereals and are predominantly from the nucleotide binding site/leucine rich repeat class which is associated with localized cell death at the pathogen entry site. Until recently, the molecular basis of race non-specific, partial and slow rusting adult plant resistance genes were unknown. Gene products that differ from known plant resistance genes were revealed from the recent cloning of the Yr18, Yr36 and Lr34 adult plant genes in wheat. The available range of diverse resistance gene sequences provide entry points for developing genebased markers and will facilitate selection of germplasm containing unique resistance gene combinations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9384928630452099450", "cites_id": ["9384928630452099450"], "pub_url": "https://globalrust.org/sites/default/files/posters/kota_2009.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:epl9rN32PYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
