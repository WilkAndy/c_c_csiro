CIMMYT.", "abstract": "^ ALr34 provides an important source of durable adult plant resistance in wheat worldwide and is expressed in maturing plants during the critical grain filling stage. The Lr34 locus has provided durable and partial resistance to the biotrophic pathogens leaf rust, stripe rust (Yr18), and powdery mildew (Pm38) and is associated with the morphological marker leaf tip necrosis. When deployed with other adult plant resistance genes, near immunity can be achieved. Map-based cloning and analysis of eight independent Lr34 mutants revealed that this multipathogen resistance is conferred by a single gene with homology to pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR)-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Mutants were more susceptible to leaf rust, stripe rust, andpowdery mildew, and they did not show leaf tip necrosis. Only three sequence polymorphisms distinguished the Lr34 allele of the resistant cultivar'Chinese Spring'from the allele of the susceptible variety'Renan'. The same resistance haplotype was found in the three independent breeding lineages of Lr34, suggesting a single evolutionary origin of the resistant allele. We have evidence that Lr34 stimulates senescence-like processes in the flag leaf tips of resistant wheat cultivars. During senescence, nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and metals are reallocated to growing seeds. Premature leaf senescence, starting from leaf tips, may therefore hamper nutrient uptake of obligate biotrophic pathogens like rusts and powdery mildew. The observation that a multi-pathogen resistance in wheat, which comprises Lr34, Yr18, Pm38, as well as the phenotypic marker leaf tip necrosis, is controlled by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10915453311884126032", "cites_id": ["10915453311884126032"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10915453311884126032&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UOc2YfR6e5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
