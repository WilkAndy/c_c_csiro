Simple and robust molecular markers that enable early detection of Lr34/Yr18 are a major advancement in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. An insertion/deletion size variant located at the csLV34 locus on chromosome 7D within an intron sequence of a sulfate transporter\u2010like gene tightly linked to the Lr34/Yr18 dual rust resistance gene was used to examine a global collection of wheat cultivars, landraces, and D genome\u2013containing diploid and polyploid species of wheat relatives. Two predominant allelic size variants, csLV34a and b, found among the wheat cultivars showed disparate variation in different wheat growing zones. A strong association was observed between the presence of Lr34/Yr18 and the csLV34b allele and wheat lines known to have Lr34/Yr18 that had the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7243907656449702607", "cites_id": ["7243907656449702607"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2007.08.0474", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z7pqOKKHh2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 14, "2011": 15, "2012": 21, "2013": 19, "2014": 20, "2015": 22, "2016": 12, "2017": 18, "2018": 17, "2019": 10, "2020": 16, "2021": 26, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
