Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) genotypes recreated from its two progenitor species, the tetraploid, Triticum turgidum (2n\u00bc 4x\u00bc 28, AABB) and its diploid wild relative, Aegilops tauschii (2n\u00bc 2x\u00bc 14, DD) are a useful resource of new genes for hexaploid wheat improvement. These include many productivity traits such as abiotic (drought, heat, salinity/sodicity, and waterlogging) and biotic (rusts, septoria, barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), crown rot, tan spot, spot blotch, nematodes, powdery mildew, and fusarium head blight) stress resistance/tolerances as well as novel grain quality traits. Numerous SHWs have been produced globally by various institutions including CIMMYT-Mexico, ICARDA-Syria, Department of Primary Industries (DPI), Victoria-Australia, IPK-Germany, Kyoto University-Japan, and USDAARS. This review examines the varied aspects in the utilization of synthetics for wheat improvement including the traits and genes identified, mapped, and transferred to common wheat. It has also been demonstrated that synthetic backcross-derived lines (SBLs, ie, when SHW is crossed to adapted local bread varieties) show significant yield increases and thus, enhanced yield performance across a diverse range of environments, demonstrating their potential for improving wheat productivity worldwide. This is particularly evident in moisturelimited environments.
