(2n = 14RR) var. Petkus, which has    rust resistance genes such as Lr26, Sr31 andRr9. We designed primers based    on the NBS region and performed PCR using Petkus genomic DNA as a template.    Next, we TA-cloned a 532-bp DNA fragment containing five homologous amino    acid sequences in the NBS region. The SA-treated rye showed strong    expression of a transcript of approximately 3.5 knt in the Northern blots    probed with the NBS fragment; however, no transcripts were observed with the    untreated rye. We constructed a cDNA library of rye var. Petkus treated with    SA, and then screened the cDNA library using the TA-cloned NBS fragments as    a probe. The entire nucleotide sequence of a full length of rye    NBS-LRR-containing class cDNA 3,446 bp was determined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?ID=0534-00122101001T", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6zw3vW45b1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
