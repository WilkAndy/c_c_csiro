Sr6 was one of the first widely deployed stem rust resistance genes and is still effective in some parts of the world. A major characteristic of Sr6 is that it is effective at lower greenhouse temperatures but loses resistance at higher temperatures. Here we identified a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat protein (NB-LRR) with a non-canonical, integrated zinc finger BED domain. Using mutagenesis and resistance gene enrichment and sequencing (MutRenSeq) to identify loss-of-function mutations, we confirmed that this gene is Sr6. The cloning of Sr6 will facilitate marker assisted screening and allow study of the underlying mechanisms of temperature sensitivity in resistance genes and reversible plantpathogen interactions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/24423/hewitt_tc_thesis.pdf?sequence=1#page=151", "cites_per_year": {}}
