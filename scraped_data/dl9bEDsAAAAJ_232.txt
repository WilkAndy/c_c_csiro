Lr13 resides in the proximal region of chromosome arm 2BS and is pleiotropic or strongly linked to the Ne2m allele, causing hybrid necrosis in crosses carrying the complementary locus Ne1 on chromosome arm 5BL. A nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immune receptor-encoding gene was isolated following mutagenesis and resistance (R) gene enrichment and sequencing (MutRenSeq). Genetic segregation, comparative genomics, and analysis of 29 mutants for Lr13, which had also been shown to have lost Ne2m, strongly support the identity of a single Lr13/Ne2m gene. This implicates immune system dysfunction as the cause of hybrid necrosis in wheat involving the epistatic loci Ne2 and Ne1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/24423/hewitt_tc_thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=109", "cites_per_year": {}}
