A nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immune receptor-encoding gene was isolated using mutagenesis and R gene enrichment sequencing (MutRenSeq). Single chromosome enrichment sequencing (ChromSeq) was also performed on the relevant chromosome 7A to investigate the suppressed recombination. Mutant sequencing, genetic segregation and stable transformation demonstrated the isolated NB-LRR was indeed Pm1, which could independently induce hypersensitive cell death in transformed susceptible plants under control of its native promoter. Flow-sorting and assembly of chromosome 7A indicated the region of suppressed recombination was due to a rearrangement likely involving chromosomes 7B and 7D. The cloning of Pm1 and sequencing of highly differentiated chromosome 7A is a big step in deciphering this complex resistance cluster and understanding its unique evolution relating to chromosomal rearrangements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/24423/hewitt_tc_thesis.pdf?sequence=1#page=76", "cites_per_year": {}}
