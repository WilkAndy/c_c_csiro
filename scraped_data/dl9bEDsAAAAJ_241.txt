Genetics of the resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust were investigated in 148 F5 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between \u2018Avocet\u2019and \u2018New Pusa 876\u2019(NP876). The parents and population were phenotyped for resistance in field trials for three and two years for leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively, and genotyped with the known gene-linked molecular markers. The segregation analyses indicated that the adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust was conferred by five and four additive effect genes, respectively. Among them, the slow-rusting APR gene Lr46/Yr29 reduced 14% and 16% of mean leaf rust and stripe rust severities, respectively, whereas a severity reduction of 26% occurred due to Lr67/Yr46 for both rusts. Both resistance genes were contributed by NP876. A positive additivity effect between leaf rust resistance genes Lr46 and Lr67 was detected with a reduction up to 11% when they were present together. The additivity for stripe rust between Yr29 and Yr46 was positive but not significant with a mean reduction of 5% in severity. NP876 can be used as a multiple rust resistant source to breed wheat varieties that may contribute towards durable resistance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://colposdigital.colpos.mx:8080/jspui/bitstream/10521/4004/1/Ponce_Molina_LJ_DC_Genetica_2017.pdf#page=78", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T7bF4iF6VQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
