Specific primer sequences derived from a previously isolated NBS-LRR sequence at the Cre3 locus, which confers resistance to cereal cyst nematode (CCN) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were used in isolating a family of resistance gene analogs (RGA) through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning approach. The cloning, analysis and genetic mapping of a family of RGAs from wheat (cv \u2018Chinese Spring\u2019) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cvs \u2018Chebec\u2019 and \u2018Harrington\u2019) are presented. The wheat and barley RGAs contain other conserved motifs present in known R genes from other plants and share between 55\u201399% amino acid sequence identity to the NBS-LRR sequence at the Cre3 locus.
