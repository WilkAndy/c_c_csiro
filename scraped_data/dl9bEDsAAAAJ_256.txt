An LOD score of 3.0 was used as a threshold for the declaration of linkage, Genetic distances in centimorgans (cM) were calculated by applying the Kosambi (Kosambi, 1944) mapping function and. The genetic map was drawn with the software Mapdraw V2. 1 (Liu and Meng, 2003)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://sophiapublisher.com/epublication-02/MPB/HTML/2010.vol01/3/files/assets/downloads/page0008.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d9sDHi5zXkEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
