CIMMYT.", "abstract": "^ AImproved resistance to fungal rust diseases in cereals is critical for world food security and can only be achieved through breeding varieties with durable rust resistance. Durable resistance is not caused by single genes, but by a combination of usually 3-5 individual partial genes which are combined by classical breeding in a single wheat line to achieve near immunity. The wheat gene Lr34 is such a quantitatively acting, partial resistance gene which is involved in durable resistance. Lr34 is associated with resistance to two different rust diseases of wheat, leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis). Interestingly, it also confers partial resistance to the powdery mildew pathogen. Lr34 is expressed in adult plants during the critical grain filling stage and is most effective in the flag leaf. Flag leaves of many wheat cultivars containing Lr34 develop a necrotic leaf tip, a morphological marker described as leaf tip necrosis. The expression of this trait, however, is strongly dependent on the environment. The Lr34 gene was first documented in Canada although Lr34-containing germplasm has been a part of wheat improvement since the early part of the 20th century and seems to have originated in Italian and Chinese material. Wheat cultivars containing Lr34 occupy more than 26 million hectares in various developing countries alone and contribute substantially to yield savings in epidemic years. The Lr34 gene has remained durable and no evolution of increased virulencetowards Lr34 has been observed for more than 50 years of large scale use in resistant wheat lines.
