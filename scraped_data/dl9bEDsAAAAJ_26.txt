A DNA marker cosegregating with H. avenae resistance was used as an entry point for map-based cloning of a disease resistance gene family at the Cre3 locus. Two related gene sequences have been analysed at the Cre3 locus. One, identified as a cDNA clone, encodes a polypeptide with a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and a leucine-rich region; this member of the disease resistance gene family is expressed in roots. A second Cre3 gene sequence, cloned as genomic DNA, appears to be a pseudogene, with a frame shift caused by a deletion event. These two genes, related to members of the cytoplasmic NBS \u2013 leucine rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes were physically mapped to the distal 0.06 fragment of the long arm of wheat chromosome 2D and cosegregated with nematode \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11169891623239839602", "cites_id": ["11169891623239839602"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g97-087", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cm_SLkBtA5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 19, "1999": 10, "2000": 18, "2001": 13, "2002": 12, "2003": 13, "2004": 10, "2005": 10, "2006": 18, "2007": 9, "2008": 10, "2009": 13, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
