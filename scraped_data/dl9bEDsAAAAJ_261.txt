The goal of this project is to systematically reduce the world's vulnerability to rust diseases of wheat through an international collaboration of unprecedented scale and scope. The primary goal of the Marker Development and Optimization component of the project is to identify robust markers for previously characterized and novel sources of stem rust resistance. A progress report will be presented on our four subobjectives: 1) Optimization of markers for previously characterized stem rust resistance genes including genes contributing complex adult plant resistance, 2) haplotyping uncharacterized rust resistant genotypes to infer novelty and to plan new mapping experiments, 3) pyramiding novel sources of rust resistance, and 4) mapping novel sources of rust resistance.
