Two tandemly duplicated tau class GST genes (TtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2) were isolated from a single bacterial artificial chromosome clone in a library constructed from the diploid wheat and D genome progenitor to cultivated wheat, Triticum tauschii. The genes are very similar in genomic structure and their encoded proteins are 95% identical. Gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed differential transcript accumulation of TtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2 in roots and shoots. Expression of both genes was induced by herbicide safeners, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and abscisic acid, in the shoots of T. tauschii; however, expression of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13674412040619191338&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
