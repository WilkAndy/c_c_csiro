FISH analysis using a large DNA insert library of wheat identified a 67-kb clone (R11H) that showed strong hybridization signals on the centromeres. The R11H clone contains Ty3 / gypsy retrotransposon-related sequences; both integrase and CCS1 family sequences were identified. Subsequently, we isolated additional 23 large-insert clones which also contained the integrase and CCS1 sequences. Based on the number of the integrase repeats in the clones determined by DNA gel blot analysis, we concluded that the retrotransposon-like sequences are tandemly repeated in wheat centromeres in ca. 55-kb interval on average. This conclusion is consistent with the results of FISH analysis on the extended DNA fibers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=JP2002001024", "cites_per_year": {}}
