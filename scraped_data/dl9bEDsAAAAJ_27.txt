However this type of resistance is often difficult to incorporate into a single genetic background due to the polygenic and additive nature of the genes involved. Therefore, markers, both molecular and phenotypic, are useful tools to facilitate the use of this type of resistance in wheat breeding programs. We have used field assays to score for both leaf and yellow rust in an Avocet-YrA \u00d7 Attila population that segregates for several slow-rusting leaf and yellow rust resistance genes. This population was analyzed with the AFLP technique and the slow-rusting resistance locus Lr46/Yr29 was identified. A common set of AFLP and SSR markers linked to the Lr46/Yr29 locus was identified and validated in other recombinant inbred families developed from single \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 213, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15728527144978453857", "cites_id": ["15728527144978453857"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-005-0153-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YZWH5Br0RtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 11, "2008": 13, "2009": 9, "2010": 10, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 17, "2014": 19, "2015": 17, "2016": 7, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 18, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
