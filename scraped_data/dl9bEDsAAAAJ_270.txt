A cross was made between the resistant T. tauschii accession, RL5271, and a susceptible accession, CPI110889, to study the genetics of resistance from this source. The parental accessions and the F1 and F3 progeny were screened in the glasshouse as seedlings. The resistant parent took significantly longer to develop symptoms, developed significantly fewer lesions, and expressed significantly lower levels of disease than the susceptible parent. The F1 mean response for disease severity indicated there was no complete dominance. Thegenotypic ratios generated by screening the F3 families were not significantly different from the genotypic ratio expected for a single gene. The effectiveness and simple genetic control of the resistance in the T. tauschii accession RL5271 may be useful as a resistance source in a bread wheat breeding program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=42foSQeMXYwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA74&dq=info:R9ZHEXT9IVgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=-E-0GZKxhA&sig=Ayck_nYrfJiEQcFpVnCgzk1hQmI", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R9ZHEXT9IVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
