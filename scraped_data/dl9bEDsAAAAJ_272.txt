These isolates and a subset of isolates taken from a single location were used to assay the level of variation within the pathogen population. The isolates were compared using anonymous nuclear DNA markers. Three low copy number and a single high copy number probe were used to generate restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). The collection exhibited a high genotypic diversity for the high copy number probe. This is consistent with the high level of sexual reproduction previously found in the fungal population. Only minor differences between the total collection of isolates and the subset of isolates taken from the single location were found."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1958444096199187985&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
