Loci detected by the wheat, barley, rice and maize RGA clones were designated as Wrga, Brga, Rrga and Mrga respectively. An F, population of 58 Triticum tauschii lines was derived from a cross between CPI 110856 and AUS 18913 and used for the mapping of RGAs on chromosome 1DS. RGA clones that were used in this study are compared in Figure 1 to a NBS-LRR sequence isolated from the Cre3 cereal cyst nematode (CCN) locus in T. tauschii (Lagudah et al. 1997). The isolation of RGA clones was described previously in Lagudah et al.(1997), Spielmeyer et al.(1998), Seah et al.(1998), Collins et al.(1998) and Leister et al.(1998) with the exception of"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5230191573135798446&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rjAAaIZflUgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
