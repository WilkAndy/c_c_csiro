Studies are also being carried out on the manipulation of the D genome of wheat. Within Australia the screening has begun of a collection of 420 accessions of Triticum tauschii (the donor of the D genome). Disease resistance has been sought and found for cereal cyst nematode, Septoria nodorum, Septoria tritici, Puccinia striiformis, P. recondita and P. graminis. At the DNA level the collection has been screened for variation at the 5SDna and Nor loci, as well as generating Pst (a restriction endonuclease) genomic clones, in preparation for providing RFLP markers for a genetic linkage map. Lines of T. tauschii showing high levels of disease resistance have been crossed directly to Australian wheat cultivars or are being used to form synthetic hexaploids by crossing to tetraploid wheats."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9003278", "cites_per_year": {}}
