Tritici) in central and south eastern parts of Ethiopia", "citation": "", "author": "Tamirat Negash and Alemayehu Chala and Evans Lagudah and Wuletaw Tadesse", "abstract": "The present investigation was carried out to detect the prevailing virulent races of yellow rust at field, to identify resistance wheat lines and effective genes for yellow rust. The experiments were carried out in nonreplicated design having about 100 entries and differentials both at Sinana and Kulumsa research stations. YR5, YR8, YR15, YR17, YR27, Lassik (-Yr5) and Lassik (+ Yr5) resistance genes have immune field reaction at Kulumsa and also Yr15 was the only differential lines resistant to the existing isolates at Sinana. The result depicted that 7, 17 and 76 wheat lines were resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible reaction at seedling stage to Kubsa isolate, respectively and 12, 27 and 61 wheat lines exhibited resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible reactions, respectively, to the Digelu isolate. At field condition 62, 7, 31 wheat lines were found to be resistant, moderately resistant and susceptible respectively at Sinana. At Kulumsa 97 and 3 wheat lines were found to be resistant and susceptible respectively. Wheat lines Av Yr 15, WT6/12, Sr 33/Cs# 4, Sr 33/Cs# 5, Sr 33+ Sr 2/Cs# 14, Sr 33+ Sr 2/Cs# 15, Sr 45/Cs# 20 and Sr 45+ Sr 2/Cs# 29 were immune at field condition of all locations. However, Westonia, Thatcher, Avocet, CANTHACHK, CT4-NS1, Pavon Sr 26+ SR 31, Westonia Sr 24+ Sr 31, Pavon Sr 24+ Sr 31 and CTH-Ns 2 exhibited maximum field severity and coefficient of infection (CoF) and hence the aforementioned resistant wheat lines may serve as better parent in resistant wheat breeding program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.noveltyjournals.com/upload/paper/Response%20of%20wheat%20lines%20to%20yellow-2212.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:64-9ybnD4e0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
