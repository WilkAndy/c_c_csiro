Gene sequences closely related to rice HKT genes were isolated from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) or barley (Hordeum vulgare) for genomic DNA southern hybridization analysis. HKT gene sequences were mapped on chromosomal arms of wheat and barley using wheat chromosome substitution lines and barley\u2013wheat chromosome addition lines. In addition, HKT gene members in the wild diploid wheat ancestors, T. monococcum (Am genome), T. urartu (Au genome), and Ae. tauschii (Dt genome) were investigated. Variation in copy number for individual HKT gene members was observed between the barley, wheat, and rice genomes, and between the different wheat genomes.
