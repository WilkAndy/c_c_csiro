The gene, encoding for an ABC transporter, confers partial and race non-specific adult plant resistance against the three wheat rusts and powdery mildew. An additional phenotype of Lr34 is leaf tip necrosis, a senescence-like process that affects flag leaves of adult wheat plants. Of the two predominant alleles found in wheat, only one mediates resistance. The two alleles differ by only two exon polymorphisms. Both polymorphisms are predicted to be located within the first transmembrane domain. The resistant haplotype evolved only in wheat and less than 8,000 years ago. An Lr34-like disease resistance has not been described in other cereals such as rice and barley which is in agreement with the very recent evolution of the resistant Lr34 allele in wheat. We therefore transformed barley with genomic Lr34. Transgenic barley became more resistant to barley leaf rust (Puccinia hordei) and barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei). In contrast to wheat, resistance was effective already in seedlings. However, resistance was accompanied by strong leaf necrosis resulting in reduced plant vigor and seed production, indicating a trade-off between resistance level and plant fitness. The aim of this project is to engineer barley plants with adequate Lr34 resistance but no reduction in plant fitness. The severe Lr34-phenotype in barley is most likely due to miss-regulated gene expression. Therefore we will fine-tune Lr34 expression and protein stability in barley. To do so, we will test different inducible and tissue-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rainer-Boeni-2/publication/282362650_CS-215_THE_WHEAT_RESISTANCE_GENE_Lr34_PROVIDES_MULTI-PATHOGEN_RESISTANCE_IN_BARLEY/links/560e8b2408ae6b29b4987e04/CS-215-THE-WHEAT-RESISTANCE-GENE-Lr34-PROVIDES-MULTI-PATHOGEN-RESISTANCE-IN-BARLEY.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
