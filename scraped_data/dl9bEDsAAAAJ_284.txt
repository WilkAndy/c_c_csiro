These results may allow subsequent development of PCR-based markers to facilitate markerassisted selection (MAS) of specific Glo-2 alleles and HMW glutenins. This knowledge contributes to the strategic conservation of wheat genetic resources and improvement of wheat breeding to meet the challenges of the 21st century."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iwgs2017.boku.ac.at/wp/wp-content/uploads/abstracts/96/Poster-IWGS-Vienna(2).pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z9ysS9RXeyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
