One of these genes is predicted to be functional based on the presence of an open reading frame and it also contains an additional 49 amino acids present as a direct repeat within the LRR. Frameshifts in the gene sequences were present in the other two members due to deletion and base substitution events. These sequences from the Cre3 locus hybridised to multiple fragments in bread wheat and were shown by genetic analysis to detect other homologues located at different loci. Analysis of appropriate genetic stocks for Cre1, Cre2 and CreX genes, which included near isogenic lines, segregating families and deletion lines revealed that the NBS-LRR sequences from the Cre3 locus detected diagnostic fragments specific for the Cre1, Cre2 and CreX loci.
