For thousands of years wheat landraces have evolved under the influence of natural and artificial selection as performed by many generations of farmers. The differences in soil and climatic conditions between areas of wheat cultivation and heterogeneity of environments within these areas have led to the development of a large number of landraces adapted to local environments and which are characterized by yield stability in conditions of traditionally low input agricultural systems. Accurate assessment of landrace material is necessary to detect its genetic differentiation and facilitate efficient involvement in future breeding programs. The use of morphological and agronomical traits have been used to classify landraces, however, until recently little information about their genetic relationships was available. The last century, only a small proportion of the landraces gene pool was utilized in wheat breeding programs. The objectives of this work were to (i) determine SSR based genetic diversity among bread wheat landraces collected in different agro-ecological zones and stored in the three gene banks,(ii) to evaluate the usefulness of SSR markers as a tool to improve the management of wheat genetic resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://green.nw.ru/biohim/Strelch_3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dXa13b1ppXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
