Genes are designated as Sr55, Pm46 and Ltn3 , respectively. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) accession RL6077, known to carry the pleiotropic slow rusting leaf and yellow rust resistance genes Lr67/Yr46 in Thatcher background, displayed significantly lower stem rust (P. graminis tritici; Pgt) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici; Bgt) severities in Kenya and in Norway, respectively, compared to its recurrent parent Thatcher. We investigated the resistance of RL6077 to stem rust and powdery mildew using Avocet \u00d7 RL6077 F6 recombinant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 206, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13703076390100597404", "cites_id": ["13703076390100597404"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-013-2256-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nPr88V8bK74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 9, "2015": 18, "2016": 14, "2017": 22, "2018": 18, "2019": 25, "2020": 22, "2021": 27, "2022": 37, "2023": 13}}
