The source of the resistance gene was the L1 disomic addition line, which carries the 7Ai-1 chromosome. The resistance locus is on the long arm of this chromosome. BYDV resistant recombinant lines were identified after three or more generations of selection against a group 7 Th. intermedium short arm marker (red coleoptile) and selection for the presence of BYDV resistance. One recombinant line produced by ph. mutant induced homoeologous pairing and 14 recombinant lines induced by cell culture have been identified. Resistance in seven of the cell culture induced recombinants has been inherited via pollen according to Mendelian segregation ratios for up to eight generations. Meiotic analysis of heterozygotes indicates that the alien chromatin in the cell culture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14791326176191698352", "cites_id": ["14791326176191698352"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g95-051", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sNXXGMpYRc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 7, "1997": 3, "1998": 8, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 18, "2002": 13, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
