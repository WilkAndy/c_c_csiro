Genetic resistance can reduce crop losses in the field and can be selected through the use of molecular markers. However, genetic resistance often breaks down following changes in pathogen virulence, as experienced with the wheat yellow (stripe) rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). This highlights the need to (1) identify genes that, alone or in combination, provide broad-spectrum resistance, and (2) increase our understanding of the underlying molecular modes of action. Here we report the isolation and characterization of three major yellow rust resistance genes (Yr7, Yr5 and YrSP) from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), each having a distinct recognition specificity. We show that Yr5, which remains effective to a broad range of Pst isolates worldwide, is closely related yet distinct from Yr7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9765039672810751524", "cites_id": ["9765039672810751524"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0236-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JEZ7U9hjhIcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 22, "2020": 47, "2021": 46, "2022": 49, "2023": 12}}
