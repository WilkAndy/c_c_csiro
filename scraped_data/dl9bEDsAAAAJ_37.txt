The degree of polymorphism in T. tauschii (D t) for these characters occurred in the order: Glu-D t1 < Gli-D t2 < Gli-D t1; although polymorphism for these traits was quite high, only a limited number of variant forms identified with the Glu-D t1 and Gli-D t1 loci were closely matched to their analogous variants in the D genome of hexaploid wheat. Two-dimensional (LEF X SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed differences between one of the prevalent allelic forms \u2014 Glu-D1d \u2014 of hexaploid wheat and its corresponding variant in the putative diploid donor, as evident by a relatively more acidic subunit 10 in the latter compared to the former."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 178, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15964746089827254498,5927841534848926561,15398402784556993348", "cites_id": ["15964746089827254498", "5927841534848926561", "15398402784556993348"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00289125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4sB13fsrjt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 8, "2003": 9, "2004": 3, "2005": 9, "2006": 9, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 11, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
