A few of these genes from the \u2018slow-rusting\u2019 adult plant resistance (APR) class confer partial resistance in a race non-specific manner to one or multiple rust diseases. The recent cloning of two of these genes, Lr34/Yr18, a dual APR for leaf rust and stripe rust, and Yr36, a stripe rust APR gene, showed that they differ from other classes of plant resistance genes. Currently, seven Lr34/Yr18 haplotypes have been identified from sequencing the encoding ATP Binding Cassette transporter gene from diverse wheat germplasm of which one haplotype is commonly associated with the resistance phenotype. The paucity of well characterised APR genes, particularly for stem rust, calls for a focused effort in developing critical genetic stocks to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16508113944675794430", "cites_id": ["16508113944675794430"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10681-010-0336-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_r0SQCuaGOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 12, "2013": 12, "2014": 14, "2015": 13, "2016": 11, "2017": 15, "2018": 15, "2019": 22, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 24, "2023": 5}}
