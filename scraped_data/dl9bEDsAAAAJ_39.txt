A 247-bp region of the wheat D-genome Xwye838 locus, encoding ADP-glucopyrophosphorylase, and a 326-bp region of the wheat D-genome Gss locus, encoding granule-bound starch synthase, were sequenced in a total 564 lines of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum, genome AABBDD) involving all its subspecies and 203 lines of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid source of the wheat D genome. In Ae. tauschii, two SNP variants were detected at the Xwye838 locus and 11 haplotypes at the Gss locus. Two haplotypes with contrasting frequencies were found at each locus in wheat. Both wheat Xwye838 variants, but only one of the Gss haplotypes seen in wheat, were found among the Ae. tauschii lines. The other wheat Gss haplotype was not found in either Ae. tauschii or 70 lines of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6740427987164881469", "cites_id": ["6740427987164881469"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/167/2/941/6050276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PWIQwYrPil0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 8, "2007": 16, "2008": 12, "2009": 20, "2010": 18, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 14, "2014": 13, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
