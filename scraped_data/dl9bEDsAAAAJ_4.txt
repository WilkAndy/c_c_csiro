To date, sequence-based tools to accelerate wheat improvement are lacking. As part of the international effort to sequence the 17\u2013billion\u2013base-pair hexaploid bread wheat genome (2n = 6x = 42 chromosomes), we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)\u2013based integrated physical map of the largest chromosome, 3B, that alone is 995 megabases. A chromosome-specific BAC library was used to assemble 82% of the chromosome into 1036 contigs that were anchored with 1443 molecular markers, providing a major resource for genetic and genomic studies. This physical map establishes a template for the remaining wheat chromosomes and demonstrates the feasibility of constructing physical maps in large, complex, polyploid genomes with a chromosome-based approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 522, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=440346191150878646", "cites_id": ["440346191150878646"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1161847", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:to--HYdsHAYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 36, "2010": 48, "2011": 44, "2012": 56, "2013": 68, "2014": 56, "2015": 56, "2016": 35, "2017": 20, "2018": 24, "2019": 16, "2020": 22, "2021": 20, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
