The gene for Sr2 confers adult plant resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici) and was originally transferred to bread wheat from the tetraploid emmer (\u2018Yaroslav\u2019) to the cultivars Hope and H-44. The gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3B and confers a durable adult plant resistance to stem rust usually expressed only in the field. The chromosome segment carrying the Lr37, Sr38, Yr17 resistance genes is located on 2AS and was originally introduced into wheat through an Aegilops ventricosa Triticum persicum cross, followed by a cross to the cultivar Marne (VPM1).
