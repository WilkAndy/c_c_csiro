Synthetic allohexaploid wheats produced from different Triticum turgidurn var. durum (genome AABB) lines and H. avenae resistant accessions of T tauschii maintained the level of resistance expressed in the diploids. This is the first report of resistance to H. avenae in T. tauschii, and in synthesized allohexaploid wheat. Since the resistance is in the D genome it is likely to be novel. Resistance was most common in T. tauschii ssp. eusquarrosa var. meyeri, and its derivatives which are confined to the Pahlavi region of Iran."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 156, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12391235797622654489", "cites_id": ["12391235797622654489"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9910069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GQZnbU6D9qsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 8, "2002": 3, "2003": 7, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 13, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
