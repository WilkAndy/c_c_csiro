Higher levels of resistance relative to the phenotype of the Cre1 CCN resistance gene in wheat were found in the donor Ae. ventricosa parental lines and chromosome-5Nv substitution or addition lines. The newly identified resistance to pathotype Ha13 on chromosome 5Nv, designated, Cre6, was shown to be independent of the Ae. ventricosa-derived Cre2 gene, effective against several European pathotypes. Another Ae. ventricosa derived gene, Cre5, showed partial resistance to pathotype Ha13. Inhibition of Ha13 female nematode reproduction was ranked in the order Cre6 >Cre1 >CreF\u2265Cre5. Cre6 was inherited as a single dominant locus.
