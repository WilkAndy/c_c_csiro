More advanced breeding approaches using quantitative disease resistance genes and resistance gene pyramids are being used to combat wheat stem rust and other diseases, though widespread adoption of these breeding methodologies is needed to maintain resistance efficacy. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of plant disease resistance at both host and nonhost levels offers further possibilities for stem rust resistance using biotechnological approaches. However, truly durable resistance to wheat stem rust and other phytopathogens seems an unlikely prospect in the face of continually evolving pathogen populations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16635630245404945863", "cites_id": ["16635630245404945863"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526608000290", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xy0boJGh3eYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 14, "2012": 11, "2013": 11, "2014": 19, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 12, "2019": 16, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
