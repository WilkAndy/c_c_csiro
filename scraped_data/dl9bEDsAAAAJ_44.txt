Aegilops tauschii), the D-genome progenitor of wheat. The library was made in a binary vector that had previously been shown to stably maintain large inserts of foreign DNA in Escherichia coli. The use of root nuclei reduced considerably the proportion of the library containing clones derived from chloroplast DNA. Several experimental parameters were investigated and optimised, leading to a high cloning efficiency. Only three ligations were needed to construct the library which was estimated to be equivalent to 3.7 haploid genomes. The accuracy of this estimation was demonstrated by screening this library with three well-defined probes. One probe containing a glutenin gene sequence identified 5 clones \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17812253391485079813", "cites_id": ["17812253391485079813"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220051237", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BRG3EBbWMfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 10, "2001": 15, "2002": 14, "2003": 14, "2004": 18, "2005": 14, "2006": 13, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
