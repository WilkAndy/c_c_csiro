Although the data-base is extremely limited, the available evidence suggests that within a subclass or tribe phylogenetic inference can be made, provided that a knowledge about the number of chromosomal locations of the gene loci (5S Dna loci) is available. The evidence suggests little, if any, exchange occurs between the 5S DNA units at different chromosomal loci and the available data favour a mechanism involving amplification/deletion processes for creating structural changes at the5S Dna loci. Sequences originating from species in the familiesRosaceae, Poaceae, andBrassicaceae tended to group together in cladistic analyses but with low confidence limits.
