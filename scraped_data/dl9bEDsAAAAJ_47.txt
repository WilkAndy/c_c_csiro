Because barley does not have an Lr34 ortholog, we expressed Lr34 in barley to investigate its potential as a broad\u2010spectrum resistance resource in another grass species. We found that introduction of the genomic Lr34 sequence confers resistance against barley leaf rust and barley powdery mildew, two pathogens specific for barley but not virulent on wheat. In addition, the barley lines showed enhanced resistance against wheat stem rust. Transformation with the Lr34 cDNA or the genomic susceptible Lr34 allele did not result in increased resistance. Unlike wheat, where Lr34\u2010conferred resistance is associated with adult plants, the genomic Lr34 transgenic barley lines exhibited multipathogen resistance in seedlings. These transgenic barley lines \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17453623970045210108", "cites_id": ["17453623970045210108"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_K3JCYe6N_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 20, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 16, "2023": 4}}
