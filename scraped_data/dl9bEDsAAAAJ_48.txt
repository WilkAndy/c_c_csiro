Schmal. (D genome donor to hexaploid wheat) vary in salt tolerance and in the rate that Na+ accumulates in leaves. The aim of this study was to determine whether these differences in salt tolerance and leaf Na+ concentration would be expressed in hexaploid wheat. Synthetic hexaploids were produced from five T. tauschii accessions varying in salt tolerance and two salt-sensitive T. turgidum cultivars. The degree of salt tolerance of the hexaploids was evaluated as the grain yield per plant in 150 mol m-3 NaCl relative to grain yield in 1 mol m-3 NaCl (control). Sodium concentration in leaf 5 was measured after the leaf was fully expanded. The salt tolerance of the genotypes correlated negatively with the concentration of Na+ in leaf 5. The salt tolerance of the synthetic hexaploids was greater than the tetraploid parents primarily due to the maintenance of kernel weight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17937299845315779831", "cites_id": ["17937299845315779831"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00224174", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:91y3ZSwX7vgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 7}}
