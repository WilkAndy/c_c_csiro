(syn. Aegilops ventricosa Tausch) segment in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This gene family was introgressed, together with the linked rust resistance genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38 from T. ventricosum, to wheat chromosome 2AS. An independently derived T. ventricosum segment carrying a leaf rust resistance gene in a French wheat cultivar, was shown to exhibit a rust resistance response equivalent to Lr37 as well as Yr17 and Sr38. DNA probes from different regions of the Vrga1D clone consistently detected the presence of RFLPs associated with the introgressed segment carrying the resistance genes Yr17, Lr37 and Sr38 present in diverse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1581381128304859169", "cites_id": ["1581381128304859169"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220051686", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IRge98Ex8hUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
