A subset of the wESTs was also used to identify corresponding bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the diploid D genome of wheat (Aegilops tauschii). Conservation and deviation of micro-colinearity within blocks of genes were found in the D genome BACs relative to the orthologous sequences in rice. Extensive RFLP analysis using the wEST derived clones as probes on a panel of wheat genetic stocks with or without Lr34/Yr18 revealed monomorphic patterns as the norm in this region of the wheat genome. A similar pattern was observed with single nucleotide polymorphism analysis on a subset of the wEST derived clones and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 502, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8456604389073923880", "cites_id": ["8456604389073923880"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-006-0406-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KK_CCOPkW3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 12, "2008": 28, "2009": 26, "2010": 16, "2011": 22, "2012": 34, "2013": 32, "2014": 35, "2015": 48, "2016": 37, "2017": 30, "2018": 27, "2019": 30, "2020": 42, "2021": 36, "2022": 29, "2023": 14}}
