Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregates with resistance to powdery mildew (Pm38) and a leaf tip necrosis phenotype (Ltn1). Using a high resolution mapping family from a cross between near-isogenic lines in the \u201cThatcher\u201d background we demonstrated that Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregated with stem rust resistance in the field. Lr34/Yr18 probably interacts with unlinked genes to provide enhanced stem rust resistance in \u201cThatcher\u201d. In view of the relatively low levels of DNA polymorphism reported in the Lr34/Yr18 region, gamma irradiation of the single chromosome substitution line, Lalbahadur(Parula7D) that carries Lr34/Yr18 was used to generate several mutant lines. Characterisation of the mutants revealed a range of highly informative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7854449235692124473", "cites_id": ["7854449235692124473"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-007-0684-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OXnEF_ebAG0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 9, "2009": 13, "2010": 8, "2011": 16, "2012": 13, "2013": 13, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
