The linkage map was constructed using a mapping population from doubled-haploid (DH) lines. The DH lines were derived from the haploid component of F2 haploid-diploid twin seed originating from a cross between a polyembryonic, low-linolenic-acid genotype (CRZY8/RA91) and the Australian cultivar \u2018Glenelg\u2019. The AFLP technique was employed to generate 213 marker loci covering approximately 1400\u2004cM of the flax genome (n=15) with an average spacing of 10\u2004cM and comprising 18 linkage groups. Sixty AFLP markers (28%) deviated significantly (P<0.05) from the expected segregation ratio. The map incorporated RFLP markers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12696547093452992998", "cites_id": ["12696547093452992998"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220050939", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5rFI808yM7AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 12, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 15, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
