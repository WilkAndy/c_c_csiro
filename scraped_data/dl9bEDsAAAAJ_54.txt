The resistant Lr34 allele evolved after wheat domestication through two gain\u2010of\u2010function mutations in an ATP\u2010binding cassette transporter gene. An Lr34\u2010like fungal disease resistance with a similar broad\u2010spectrum specificity and durability has not been described in other cereals. Here, we transformed the resistant Lr34 allele into the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Transgenic rice plants expressing Lr34 showed increased resistance against multiple isolates of the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Host cell invasion during the biotrophic growth phase of rice blast was delayed in Lr34\u2010expressing rice plants, resulting in smaller necrotic lesions on leaves. Lines with Lr34 also developed a typical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2446086178452024152", "cites_id": ["2446086178452024152"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12491", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WCugXGs-8iEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 20, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 22, "2021": 18, "2022": 12, "2023": 7}}
