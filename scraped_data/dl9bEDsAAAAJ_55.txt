This R protein diversity may be attributable to the different modus operandi employed by pathogen species in some cases, but it is also a consequence of multiple defence strategies being employed against phytopathogens. Mutational analysis of barley has identified additional genes required for activation of an R gene-mediated defence response upon pathogen infection. In some instances very closely related barley R proteins require different proteins for defence activation, demonstrating that, within a single plant species, multiple resistance signalling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14309771632866455318", "cites_id": ["14309771632866455318"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/94/6/765/264484", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fm_30XuFlsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 14, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
