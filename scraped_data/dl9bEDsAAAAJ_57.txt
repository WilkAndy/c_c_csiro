Lr34, located on chromosome\u20037D, encodes an ATP\u2010binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Both wheat cultivars with and without Lr34\u2010based resistance encode a putatively functional protein that differ by only two amino acid polymorphisms. In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in hexaploid wheat and other grasses. In hexaploid wheat we found an expressed and putatively functional Lr34 homoeolog located on chromosome\u20034A, designated Lr34\u2010B. Another homoeologous Lr34 copy, located on chromosome\u20037A, was disrupted by the insertion of repetitive elements. Protein sequences of LR34\u2010B and LR34 were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5736682254181549600", "cites_id": ["5736682254181549600"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04430.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IEbHrR3KnE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 9, "2013": 14, "2014": 13, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 14, "2018": 10, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
