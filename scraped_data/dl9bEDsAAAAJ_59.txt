The wheat Lr34 gene is one of the few cloned, durable resistance genes in plants. It encodes an ATP binding cassette transporter and has been a source of resistance against biotrophic pathogens, such as leaf rust (Puccinina triticina), for over 100\u2003years. As endogenous Lr34 confers quantitative resistance, we wanted to determine the effects of transgenic Lr34 with specific reference to how expression levels affect resistance. Transgenic Lr34 wheat lines were made in two different, susceptible genetic backgrounds. We found that the introduction of the Lr34 resistance allele was sufficient to provide comparable levels of leaf rust resistance as the endogenous Lr34 gene. As with the endogenous gene, we observed resistance in seedlings after cold treatment and in flag leaves of adult plants, as well as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1503869918357508248", "cites_id": ["1503869918357508248"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2012.00683.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mFAYELnR3hQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 15, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
