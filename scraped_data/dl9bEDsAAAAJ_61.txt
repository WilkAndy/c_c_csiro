These subunits had been previously identified using SDS\u2013PAGE. The characterisation revealed that subunits Dy10tand Dy12tfromT. tauschiicould be differentiated from their bread wheat counterparts using both urea SDS\u2013PAGE and RP\u2013HPLC. In the latter case, theT. tauschiiy-type subunits were clearly more hydrophobic than the Dy type subunits of bread wheat. The characterisation also suggested that subunit Dx5t, derived from two separateT. tauschiiaccessions, did not contain the extra cysteine residue characteristic of Dx5 from bread wheat. RFLP analysis of the genes encoding the HMW glutenin subunits of interest suggested that the absence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1293896792647942370", "cites_id": ["1293896792647942370"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521096900223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4kDMDUfY9BEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
