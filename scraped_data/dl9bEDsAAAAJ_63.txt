Cre1, located on chromosome 2B, confers resistance to most European nematodes and the sole Australian pathotype, while Cre3, present on chromosome 2D, is highly resistant to the Australian patho-type and susceptible to a number of European pathotypes. Genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) proteins that cosegregate with the Cre3 locus cross hybridize to homologues whose restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns distinguish near-isogenic Cre1 nematode-resistant wheat lines. Genetic mapping showed that the NBS-LRR gene members that distinguished the Cre1 near-isogenic lines were located on chromosome 2BL at a locus, designated Xcsl107, that cosegregates with the Cre1 locus.
