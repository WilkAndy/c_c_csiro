Two tandemly duplicated tau class GST genes (TtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2) were isolated from a single bacterial artificial chromosome clone in a library constructed from the diploid wheat and D genome progenitor to cultivated wheat, Triticum tauschii. The genes are very similar in genomic structure and their encoded proteins are 95% identical. Gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed differential transcript accumulation ofTtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2 in roots and shoots. Expression of both genes was induced by herbicide safeners, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and abscisic acid, in the shoots of T. tauschii; however \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16867719362156704216", "cites_id": ["16867719362156704216"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/130/1/362/6110441", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2DFUEGQtFuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
