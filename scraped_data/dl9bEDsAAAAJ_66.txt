At least two unrelated resistance-gene analogs (RGAs) mapped close to known leaf rust resistance genes (Lr21 and Lr40) located distal to seed storage protein genes on chromosome 1DS. One of the two RGA clones, which was previously shown to be part of a candidate gene for stripe rust resistance (Yr10) located within the homoeologous region on 1BS, identified at least three gene family members on chromosome 1DS of Ae. tauschii. One of the gene members co-segregated with the leaf rust resistance genes, Lr21 and Lr40, in Ae. tauschii and wheat segregating families. Hence, a RGA clone derived from a candidate gene for stripe rust resistance located on chromosome 1BS detected candidate genes for leaf rust resistance located in the corresponding region on 1DS of wheat."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13348428656507564294", "cites_id": ["13348428656507564294"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220051590", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BjHH3CMlP7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 11, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5}}
