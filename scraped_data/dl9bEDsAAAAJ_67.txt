The 1RS chromosome segment being used in Australian wheats will be discussed in detail to present the molecular biological studies carried out on this chromosome segment as well as its agronomic contributions to wheat. Studies are also being carried out on the manipulation of the D genome of wheat. Within Australia we have initiated the screening of a collection of 420 accessions of Triticum tauschii (the donor of the D genome) involving groups in the Departments of Agriculture in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the University of Sydney as well in the Division of Plant Industry. Disease resistance has been sought and found for cereal cyst nematode, Septoria nodorum, Septoria tritici, Puccinia striiformis, P. recondita and P. graminis.
