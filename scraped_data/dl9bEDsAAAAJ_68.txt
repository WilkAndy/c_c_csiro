Ae. tauschii was used to overcome some of the limitations commonly associated with molecular studies of wheat such as low levels of DNA polymorphism. Detection of multiple loci by most RFLP probes suggests that gene duplication events have occurred throughout this chromosomal region. Large DNA fragments isolated from a BAC library of Ae. tauschii were used to determine the relationship between physical and genetic distance at seed storage protein loci located at the distal end of chromosome 1DS. Highly recombinogenic regions were identified where the ratio of physical to genetic distance was estimated to be <20 kb/cM. These results are discussed in relation to the genome-wide estimate of the relationship between physical and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16432240707575595818", "cites_id": ["16432240707575595818"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/155/1/361/6047966", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KsPBntwLC-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 10, "2003": 8, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
