Recent mapping of APR to stem rust indicated the possibility that this gene may also confer APR to stem rust. To confirm it, we compared the disease development of two \u03b3-irradiation induced deletion mutants developed from the original line carrying Lr46 \u2018Lalbahadur (Pavon1B)\u2019. The original line and two mutants (GID5349716 and GID5349718) were evaluated thrice at weekly intervals for stem rust responses in field trials conducted for three crop seasons (2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2012-13) under artificial epidemics with Mexican P. graminis tritici race RTR. Lalbahadur (Pavon1B) and the mutants showed moderately susceptible to susceptible \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3263375719179223341", "cites_id": ["3263375719179223341"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3263375719179223341&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LQFQLu3WSS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
