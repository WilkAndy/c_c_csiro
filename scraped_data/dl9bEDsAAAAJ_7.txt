In previous studies, this broad-spectrum resistance was shown to be controlled by a single gene which encodes a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter. Alleles of resistant and susceptible cultivars differed by only three sequence polymorphisms and the same resistance haplotype was found in the three independent breeding lineages of Lr34/Yr18/Pm38. Hence, we used these conserved sequence polymorphisms as templates to develop diagnostic molecular markers that will assist selection for durable multi-pathogen resistance in breeding programs. Five allele-specific markers (cssfr1\u2013cssfr5) were developed based on a 3 bp deletion in exon 11 of the Lr34-gene, and one marker (cssfr6) was derived from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 12 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 467, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17511594019583137781", "cites_id": ["17511594019583137781"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-009-1097-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Zcb_PqtBfMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 14, "2011": 22, "2012": 39, "2013": 28, "2014": 40, "2015": 43, "2016": 37, "2017": 41, "2018": 37, "2019": 33, "2020": 43, "2021": 32, "2022": 45, "2023": 10}}
