The phenotypic effects of genes moved to wheat from relatives with lower ploidy are often smaller than in the original sources, suggesting the presence of modifiers or partial inhibitors in wheat, especially dilution effects caused by possible variation at orthologous loci. However, there is little current understanding of the underlying genetics of suppression. The discovery of suppression in some wheat genotypes of the cereal rye chromosome 1RS-derived gene Pm8 for powdery mildew resistance offered an opportunity for analysis. A single gene for suppression was identified at or near the closely linked storage protein genes Gli-A1 and Glu-A3, which are also closely associated with the Pm3 locus on chromosome 1AS. The Pm3 locus is a complex of expressed alleles and pseudogenes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13462786181819687784", "cites_id": ["13462786181819687784"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-011-1589-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aGNmFrRs1boJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
