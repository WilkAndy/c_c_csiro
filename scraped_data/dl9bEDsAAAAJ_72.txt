Its large chromosomes and the capacity of the polyploid genome to tolerate the addition or loss of chromosomes facilitated a fast progress in early wheat genetics using cytogenetic techniques. However, these same characteristics have limited the progress in genomic studies that have been focused on diploid model species with smaller genomes such as rice and Arabidopsis. These model systems are seen as a launching pad for comparative genomic strategies to tackle the challenges associated with the larger genomes of other plants such as wheat. The strengths and limitations of comparative genomic approaches to study the wheat genome are presented in this review. Structural genomic studies in wheat started by the development of large DNA insert libraries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9831758333194685011", "cites_id": ["9831758333194685011"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S098194280001233X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U0qO9xxscYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 4, "2005": 10, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
