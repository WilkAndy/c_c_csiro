The nonrecurrent parent of the BC line was an accession of wild barley collected from Bar Giyyora, Israel (Brown et al. 1988). At the F, BC, BC, and BC, generations, we selected individual plants heterozygous for the Dip 1 allele from wild barley for crossing to Clipper. BC line 30 was produced by selfing a BC, F, individual, homozygous for the variant Dip 1 allele.Isozyme Analysis and Disease Testing We assayed 60 seedlings from the BC, F, generation of line 30 for their genotype at the Dip 1 (Dipeptidase EC 3.4. 13.11) locus using Tris-maleate starch gels (Brown 1983). The assay used a 2-cm piece of 10-day-old plumule tissue. The recurrent parent Clipper served as a control. One month after Dip1 testing, we collected leaf material and extracted DNA using the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18216929403261149425", "cites_id": ["18216929403261149425"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Brown-17/publication/15446792_Identification_of_RFLPs_Flanking_a_Scald_Resistance_Gene_on_Barley_Chromosome_6/links/57da7e1508ae72d72ea30461/Identification-of-RFLPs-Flanking-a-Scald-Resistance-Gene-on-Barley-Chromosome-6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8eC_W8aIz_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 8, "2003": 7, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
