The partial resistance provided by this gene is only apparent in adult plants and not effective in field\u2010grown seedlings. Lr34 also causes leaf tip necrosis (Ltn1) in mature adult plant leaves when grown under field conditions. This D genome\u2010encoded bread wheat gene was transferred to tetraploid durum wheat (T. turgidum) cultivar Stewart by transformation. Transgenic durum lines were produced with elevated gene expression levels when compared with the endogenous hexaploid gene. Unlike nontransgenic hexaploid and durum control lines, these transgenic plants showed robust seedling resistance to pathogens \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2522824349177504571", "cites_id": ["2522824349177504571"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12684", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O2NuC2HfAiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 13, "2022": 15, "2023": 2}}
