These two genes occur in the same orientation, are 51,893 bp apart, and the separating DNA includes a 31,000-bp cluster of retrotransposons. A second retrotransposon cluster of 32,000 bp follows the x-type HMW-glutenin gene region. Each HMW-glutenin gene is found within a region of mainly unique DNA sequence which includes multiple additional genes including an active endosperm globulin gene not previously reported in the Triticeae family, a leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) type gene truncated at the 5\u2032 end of the BAC, a kinase gene of unknown activity, remnants of a paralogous second globulin gene, and genes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16540521287316480076", "cites_id": ["16540521287316480076"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10142-002-0069-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TCBJsnm8i-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 10, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
