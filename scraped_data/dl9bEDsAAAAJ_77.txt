The 2S chromosomal segment from T. ventricosum is further delineated in translocations onto chromosome 2A of bread wheat, where the rust genes are retained but not the CreX gene. Using these critical genetic stocks, we have isolated family members of R gene analogs that are associated with either the 2S segment from T. ventricosum carrying the CreX locus or the rust genes.
