Synthetic hexaploids possessing subunits 5 and 10 of glutenin had longer peak dough development times and higher loaf volumes when compared with subunits 2 and 12. Using chloroform extraction, a higher ratio of non-polar to polar lipids was observed with subunits 2 and 12 compared with 5 and 10 after correcting to a constant flour protein level. The influence of the newly-identified HMW subunits combinations 2, T1, T2 and subunits 2\u00b71, 10\u00b71 on flour and dough properties are also reported."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13688380001543577583", "cites_id": ["13688380001543577583"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521087800164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:79-QVhbl9r0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
