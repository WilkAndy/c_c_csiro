Since its initial detection, variants of the Ug99 lineage of stem rust have been discovered in Eastern and Southern African countries, Yemen, Iran, and Egypt. To date, eight races belonging to the Ug99 lineage are known. Increased pathogen monitoring activities have led to the identification of other races in Africa and Asia with additional virulence to commercially important resistance genes. This has led to localized but severe stem rust epidemics becoming common once again in East Africa due to the breakdown of race-specific resistance gene SrTmp, which was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 466, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11641115816951334370", "cites_id": ["11641115816951334370"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/PHYTO-01-15-0030-FI", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4sWQgiiNjaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 36, "2017": 58, "2018": 53, "2019": 61, "2020": 71, "2021": 86, "2022": 69, "2023": 23}}
