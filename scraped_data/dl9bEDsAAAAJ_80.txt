Given that plant resistance genes often confer partial resistance to fungal pathogens, a simple, sensitive, nonsubjective quantitative method for measuring pathogen growth would be highly advantageous. This report describes an in planta quantitative assay for fungal biomass based upon detection of chitin using wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to a fluorophore. Using this assay, the growth of wheat rust pathogens on wheat was assayed and the additivity of several adult plant and seedling resistance genes to Puccinia striiformis, P. graminis, and P. triticina was assayed on both glasshouse- and field-grown material. The assay can discriminate between individual rust pustules on a leaf segment or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16450324904206785696", "cites_id": ["16450324904206785696"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-12-12-0291-R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oNwBw1dLS-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 7}}
