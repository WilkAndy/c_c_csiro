Sr22 was previously located on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Several backcross derivatives (hexaploid) possessing variable sized Sr22-carrying segments were used in this study to identify a closely linked DNA marker. Expressed sequenced tags belonging to the deletion bin 7AL-0.74\u20130.86, corresponding to the genomic location of Sr22 were screened for polymorphism. In addition, RFLP markers that mapped to this region were targeted. Initial screening was performed on the resistant and susceptible DNA bulks obtained from backcross derivatives carrying Sr22 in three genetic backgrounds with short T. boeoticum segments.
