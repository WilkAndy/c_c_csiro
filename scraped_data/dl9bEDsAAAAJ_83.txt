Lack of tightly linked markers has so far prevented widespread use of Lr67 in breeding programmes. Exhaustive screening of available SSR markers and 9,000 gene-associated SNPs using bulk segregant analysis yielded several linked markers but none close enough to the gene for routine breeding applications. In contrast, genotyping by sequencing identified several better-linked SNP-based markers that were converted into single-marker KASPar assays. Marker csSNP856 co-segregated with Lr67 in two mapping populations and was significantly associated with stripe rust resistance in an association mapping population of 972 wheat lines.
