The variation appeared to be independent of the altitude and geographical location of the landraces. Studies of a number of samples from each of five sites revealed that at some sites there was allelic variation at theGlu-A1 andGlu-B1 loci coding from HMW glutenin subunits, but there was no variation at theGlu-D1 locus within and between sites."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15622492291884160078", "cites_id": ["15622492291884160078"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00730641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TpQIzPc9ztgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4}}
