Increased resistance to sorghum rust and anthracnose disease symptoms following infection with the biotrophic pathogen Puccinia purpurea and the hemibiotroph Colletotrichum sublineolum, respectively, occurred in transgenic plants expressing the Lr34res ABC transporter. Transgenic sorghum lines that highly expressed the wheat Lr34res gene exhibited immunity to sorghum rust compared to the low\u2010expressing single copy Lr34res genotype that conferred partial resistance. Pathogen\u2010induced pigmentation mediated by flavonoid phytoalexins was evident on transgenic sorghum leaves following P. purpurea infection within 24\u201372 h, which paralleled Lr34res gene expression. Elevated expression of flavone synthase II, flavanone 4\u2010reductase and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9576932027786542115", "cites_id": ["9576932027786542115"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12723", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IzxHQvAY6IQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 17, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
