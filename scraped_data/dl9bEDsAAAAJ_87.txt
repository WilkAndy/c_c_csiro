The tall Indian bread wheat cultivar Sujata displays high and low infection types to leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively, at the seedling stage in greenhouse tests. It was also highly resistant to both rusts at adult plant stage in field trials in Mexico. The genetic basis of this resistance was investigated in a population of 148 F5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Avocet \u00d7 Sujata \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13034741345820698133", "cites_id": ["13034741345820698133"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-015-2454-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FWa9aDG05LQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
