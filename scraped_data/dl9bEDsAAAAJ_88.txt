The Sr2 gene has been positioned on the physical map of wheat to the distal 25% portion of the short arm of chromosome 3B. Selection for this gene in wheat breeding programs within Australia has been performed so far through the use of the linked pseudo black chaff (PBC) phenotype and of the microsatellite markers Xgwm389 and Xgwm533 that flank the gene. The molecular markers flank a genetic interval of approximately 4 cM equating to a physical distance of over 10 Mbp. Recently, a 3B-specific BAC library was developed and a physical map established for this region. Analysis of the sequence of minimal tiling path-BAC clones within the region containing the Sr2 gene enabled the development of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6585568449752472138", "cites_id": ["6585568449752472138"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11032-007-9152-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ShqE-5yjZFsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
