Because of the large, repetitive genomes of these Triticeae crops, sequence information is limited and molecular differences between modern varieties are poorly understood. To study intraspecies genomic diversity, we compared large genomic sequences at the Lr34 locus of the wheat varieties Chinese Spring, Renan, and Glenlea, and diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii. Additionally, we compared the barley loci Vrs1 and Rym4 of the varieties Morex, Cebada Capa, and Haruna Nijo. Molecular dating showed that the wheat D genome haplotypes diverged only a few thousand years ago, while some barley and Ae. tauschii haplotypes diverged more than 500,000 years ago. This suggests gene flow from wild barley relatives after domestication, whereas this was rare or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18399407423008196491", "cites_id": ["18399407423008196491"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/149/1/258/6107734", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i8cWJpHTV_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
