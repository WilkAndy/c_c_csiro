A nucleotide\u2010binding, leucine\u2010rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor gene was isolated using mutagenesis and R gene enrichment sequencing (MutRenSeq). Stable transformation confirmed Pm1a identity which induced a strong resistance phenotype in transgenic plants upon challenge with avirulent Blumeria graminis (wheat powdery mildew) pathogens. A high\u2010density genetic map of a B. graminis family segregating for Pm1a avirulence combined with pathogen genome resequencing and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) identified AvrPm1a effector gene candidates. In planta expression identified an effector, with an N terminal Y/FxC motif, that induced a strong hypersensitive response when co\u2010expressed with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13132826553616033261", "cites_id": ["13132826553616033261"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.17075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7eUZeSssQbYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 13, "2022": 29, "2023": 14}}
