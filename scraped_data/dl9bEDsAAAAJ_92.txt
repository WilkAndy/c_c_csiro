We demonstrated the potential of allele stacking to strengthen resistance against this important pathogen.Leaf rust (LR) caused by Puccinia triticina is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and the deployment of genetically resistant cultivars is the most viable strategy to minimise yield losses. In this study, we evaluated a diversity panel of 295 bread wheat accessions from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (St Petersburg, Russia) for LR resistance and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 10,748 polymorphic DArT-seq markers. The diversity panel was evaluated at seedling and adult plant growth stages using three P. triticina pathotypes prevalent in Australia.
