The diseases for which resistance was sought included cereal cyst nematode (CCN), root lesion nematode (RLN), Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), Septoria tritici blotch (STB), and the 3 rusts, leaf rust, stem rust, and stripe rust, all important diseases of bread wheat worldwide, which can severely reduce wheat yield and quality. The SHWs exhibited a wide spectrum of resistance to the 8 pathogens. The frequency of disease-resistant SHWs ranged from 1% for one species of RLN (Pratylenchus neglectus), 3% and 10% for Septoria nodorum leaf and glume blotch, 10% for seedling resistance to yellow leaf spot, 16% for CCN, 21% for the second species of RLN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4586298622075338174", "cites_id": ["4586298622075338174"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR07227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vv2pKkzOpT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
