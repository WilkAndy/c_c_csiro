In highly dynamic co-evolutionary processes such as plant-pathogen interactions, the plant\u2019s ability to rapidly adapt to newly emerging pathogens is paramount. The hexaploid wheat gene Lr34, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, confers durable field resistance against four fungal diseases. Despite its extensive use in breeding and agriculture, no increase in virulence towards Lr34 has been described over the last century. The wheat genepool contains two predominant Lr34 alleles of which only one confers disease resistance. The two alleles, located on chromosome 7DS, differ by only two exon-polymorphisms. Putatively functional homoeologs and orthologs of Lr34 are found on the B-genome of wheat and in rice and sorghum, but not in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9268002027108613097", "cites_id": ["9268002027108613097"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-012-2009-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6btoW72OnoAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 6}}
