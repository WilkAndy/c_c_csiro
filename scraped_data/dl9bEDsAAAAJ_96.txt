A new stripe rust resistance gene with moderate seedling and adult plant resistance was mapped using an F5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from the cross of the resistant parent \u2018Almop\u2019 with the susceptible parent \u2018Avocet\u2019. The parents and RILs were phenotyped for seedling stripe rust response variation in a greenhouse and in field trials at Toluca, Mexico for 2 years. Almop showed moderate levels of resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages compared with the highly susceptible response of Avocet. The distribution of homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, and segregating RILs conformed to segregation at a single locus. Seedlings and adult plant responses were correlated, indicating that the same gene conferred resistance at both stages.
