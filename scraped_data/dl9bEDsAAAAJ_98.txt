Following \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d, the disease was brought under control by the use of stem rust resistant semi dwarf spring wheats and least attention was given to stem rust improvement for several decades3. Recently, evolution of a new Pgt pathotype, Ug99, in Africa has threatened the global wheat industry. This pathotype was initially detected in Uganda during 1999 and later spread to neighbouring countries like Kenya and Ethiopia and now has reached Iran2, 4. This pathotype is virulent on many of the current stem rust resistance genes used in different wheat growing regions5. Some of the effective stem rust resistance are derived from the wild relatives of wheat. The genes Sr33 and Sr45, derived from Aegilops tauschii, were among the genes effective against Ug992. The present study was planned to identify molecular markers closely linked with stem rust resistance genes"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "dl9bEDsAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11083827851496873191", "cites_id": ["11083827851496873191"], "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3267/P066.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:51wN0LSq0ZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
