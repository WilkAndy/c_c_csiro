The monophyly of each biotype of Bemisia is supported, and a strong biogeographic pattern is evident in the data. Populations from the Americas (including the A biotype) form a clade sister to a clade comprising the silverleafing or B biotype and a nonsilverleafing biotype from the North Africa/Mediterranean region. Polymorphisms in rDNA suggest that silverleafing is a recent phenomenon, while the nonsilverleafing form is the ancestral or plesiomorphic state. Based on this phylogeny, if B. argentifolii is accepted as a separate species then one would have to review the taxonomic status of all biotypes of B. tabaci. In particular, a new name clearly would be needed for an Egypt/Spain/Sudan/Nigeria clade, and the monophyly of the haplotypes remaining in B. tabaci would be open to serious doubt.
