Here we have applied single\u2010locus microsatellites and a mitochondrial DNA marker to a subset of the same DNA extracts, and have made several additional inferences about important genetic and population processes in S. avenae. Microsatellite analysis indicated very high levels of genic and genotypic variation. S. avenae fell into three genotypic groups inferred to be almost noninterbreeding, while analysis of linkage and Hardy\u2010Weinberg equilibria suggested high levels of sexual recombination within each genotypic group. Host specialization was evident: one lineage was found only on wheat, and one (bearing many alleles inferred to be introgressed from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "elcfMysAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 270, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1723048261378292854", "cites_id": ["1723048261378292854"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-294X.1997.00280.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:drxOvkN_6RcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 12, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 14, "2003": 18, "2004": 5, "2005": 12, "2006": 10, "2007": 15, "2008": 13, "2009": 15, "2010": 14, "2011": 16, "2012": 16, "2013": 7, "2014": 13, "2015": 9, "2016": 15, "2017": 12, "2018": 7, "2019": 15, "2020": 6, "2021": 3}}
