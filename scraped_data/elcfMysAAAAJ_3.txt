Here, we present an analysis of almost 1,300 known invasive insect pests and pathogens, calculating the total potential cost of these species invading each of 124 countries of the world, as well as determining which countries present the greatest threat to the rest of the world given their trading partners and incumbent pool of invasive species. We find that countries vary in terms of potential threat from invasive species and also their role as potential sources, with apparently similar countries sometimes varying markedly depending on specifics of agricultural commodities and trade patterns. Overall, the biggest agricultural producers (China and the United States) could experience the greatest absolute cost from further species invasions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "elcfMysAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 696, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15499549648784430199", "cites_id": ["15499549648784430199"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1602205113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d5RTEkl2GdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 32, "2018": 78, "2019": 92, "2020": 134, "2021": 140, "2022": 148, "2023": 57}}
