Unfortunately, using parsimony and neighbor joining methods, global phylogenetic relationships of the major races/biotypes of B. tabaci remain unresolved. Aside from the limitations of these methods, phylogenetic analyses have been limited to only small subsets of the global collection of B. tabaci, and thus limited taxon sampling has confounded the analyses. To improve our understanding of global B. tabaci phylogenetic relationships, a Bayesian phylogenetic technique was utilized to elucidate the relationships among all COI DNA sequence data available in GenBank for B. tabaci worldwide (366 specimens). As a result, the first well-resolved phylogeny for the B. tabaci species complex was produced showing 12 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "elcfMysAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 483, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7674720186879891943", "cites_id": ["7674720186879891943"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790307001388", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:59l--VgVgmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 20, "2010": 38, "2011": 39, "2012": 43, "2013": 38, "2014": 49, "2015": 37, "2016": 25, "2017": 43, "2018": 31, "2019": 29, "2020": 27, "2021": 25, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
