However, the levels of separation within B. tabaci and the nomenclature of the various genetic groups have been a subject of debate. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate that B. tabaci is a complex composed of >28 morphologically indistinguishable species. In this article, we first review the debate and difficulties associated with B. tabaci's taxonomy and systematics, and argue for the need to apply the biological species concept in order to elucidate B. tabaci's systematics. We summarize the accumulated genetic and behavioural data on reproductive incompatibilities evident amongst phylogenetic mtCOI groups of B. tabaci. Crossing studies have been conducted with 14 of the 28 putative species covering 54 reciprocal inter-species pairs, and observations on mating behaviour have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "elcfMysAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 357, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5086065089503342481", "cites_id": ["5086065089503342481"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311912600021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ka9cdEBVlUYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 21, "2013": 37, "2014": 35, "2015": 40, "2016": 30, "2017": 35, "2018": 21, "2019": 37, "2020": 38, "2021": 34, "2022": 19, "2023": 10}}
