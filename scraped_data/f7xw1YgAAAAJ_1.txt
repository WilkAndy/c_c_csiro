There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence\u2010only data to fit models, and independent presence\u2010absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well\u2010established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species\u2019 distributions. These include machine\u2010learning methods and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 9265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5564285449129889555,6288501076253832614,2124975923123995477", "cites_id": ["5564285449129889555", "6288501076253832614", "2124975923123995477"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04596.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ew9DmCJQOE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 48, "2007": 161, "2008": 255, "2009": 398, "2010": 434, "2011": 526, "2012": 578, "2013": 635, "2014": 641, "2015": 614, "2016": 652, "2017": 622, "2018": 678, "2019": 630, "2020": 696, "2021": 685, "2022": 653, "2023": 282}}
