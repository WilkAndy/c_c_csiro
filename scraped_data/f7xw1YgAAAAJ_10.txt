We estimate that land use and related pressures have already reduced local biodiversity intactness\u2014the average proportion of natural biodiversity remaining in local ecosystems\u2014beyond its recently proposed planetary boundary across 58.1% of the world\u2019s land surface, where 71.4% of the human population live. Biodiversity intactness within most biomes (especially grassland biomes), most biodiversity hotspots, and even some wilderness areas is inferred to be beyond the boundary. Such widespread transgression of safe limits suggests that biodiversity loss, if unchecked, will undermine efforts toward long-term sustainable development."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 920, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=974131797478714227", "cites_id": ["974131797478714227"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf2201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c6shabXPhA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 35, "2017": 94, "2018": 106, "2019": 142, "2020": 147, "2021": 172, "2022": 154, "2023": 61}}
