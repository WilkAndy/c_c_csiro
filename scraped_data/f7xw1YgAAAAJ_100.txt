However, there is limited advice for conservation policy makers and practitioners on when and how they should be combined. Here we provide such guidance, using insights from the recently developed Global Standard for the Identification of KBAs and the language of decision science to review and clarify their similarities and differences. We argue the two approaches are broadly similar, with both setting transparent environmental objectives and specifying actions. There is however greater contrast in the data used and actions involved, as the KBA approach uses biodiversity data alone and identifies sites for monitoring and vigilance actions at a minimum, whereas systematic conservation planning combines biodiversity and implementation\u2010relevant data to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3917837817865684239", "cites_id": ["3917837817865684239"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12625", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D8V53bz0XjYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
