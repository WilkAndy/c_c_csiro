We combined expert knowledge with community-level spatial modelling (using artificial neural networks, ANN, and generalised dissimilarity modelling, GDM) to inform climate adaptation management in widespread but highly threatened temperate grassy ecosystems (TGE) of Australian agricultural landscapes. GDM predicted high levels of \u2018biotically-scaled environmental stress\u2019 (scaled in terms of potential change in species composition of communities) for plants, reptiles and snails within the TGE under medium, and especially high, 2070 climate scenarios. Predicted stress was lower for birds, mammals and frogs, possibly owing to generally wider species distributions, but these models do not account for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1832825067439308830", "cites_id": ["1832825067439308830"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0268-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HsAmKLCAbxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
