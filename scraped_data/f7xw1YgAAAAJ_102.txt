Its application at national level must support county-specific policy and management needs as well as allowing comparisons of estimates of biodiversity change between countries and their aggregation for reporting at regional, continental and global scales.Here we outline a process for prioritising biodiversity variables at national scale using the EBV framework. The process involves separately identifying candidate EBVs that are useful for tracking important changes in biodiversity in each major ecological feature in each ecoregion within a country. The list is then prioritised based on the proportion of ecological feature ecoregion combinations using each variable within and across terrestrial, marine and freshwater realms.We showcased this process in Australian state \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8384714113213787013", "cites_id": ["8384714113213787013"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hetP1Q99XHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
