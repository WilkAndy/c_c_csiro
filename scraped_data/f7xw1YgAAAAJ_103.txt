Effective management and reconstruction of habitat to enhance species persistence needs to be informed by organism-centric approaches to evaluating alternative habitat scenarios. Such approaches need to be founded on sound ecological theory, be capable of integrating knowledge of dynamic ecological processes with data on the distribution and quality of habitat in spatially complex landscapes, and yet be simple and efficient enough for broad application. We describe a new methodology \u2013 rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence (REMP) \u2013 that integrates a cost-benefit approach to measuring landscape connectivity, using continuously variable (i.e. raster) habitat surfaces, with existing analytical techniques for determining the metapopulation capacity of a given landscape and for predicting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4993784937011960327", "cites_id": ["4993784937011960327"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320708004412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:B1pLJ_F8TUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
