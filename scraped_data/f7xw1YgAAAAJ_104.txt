Defining the reference state against which status and change are measured is essential. Typically, reference states describe historical conditions, yet historical conditions are challenging to quantify, may be difficult to falsify, and may no longer be an attainable target in a contemporary ecosystem. We have constructed a conceptual framework to help inform thinking and discussion around the philosophical underpinnings of reference states and guide their application. We characterize currently recognized historical reference states and describe them as Pre\u2010Human, Indigenous Cultural, Pre\u2010Intensification and Hybrid\u2010Historical. We extend the conceptual framework to include contemporary reference states as an alternative theoretical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8555529689098474150", "cites_id": ["8555529689098474150"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15383", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ptIFUOxYu3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 14, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
