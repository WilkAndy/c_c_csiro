RS can describe what a site looks like and how it behaves (using time series), but is unable to distinguish anthropogenic impacts from natural dynamics. Consequently, it is possible to mistake a heavily degraded habitat for a natural habitat, for example a logged forest may appear identical to an intact open woodland. This problem is compounded by the existence of multiple natural states in any given environment, and spatial variation in the natural composition and structure of vegetation as a function of variation in environment. Uncertainty in assessing habitat condition from RS is often further exacerbated by sparseness in the spatial coverage of training data. We describe a novel generic, RS\u2010based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8596219042658127160", "cites_id": ["8596219042658127160"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OA0WsaznS3cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
