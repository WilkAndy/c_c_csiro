Although there are many approaches to designing reserves, quantitatively assessing the performance of alternative habitat configuration strategies in retaining biodiversity has been limited by the lack of suitable modelling frameworks. Here, we apply a new dynamic macroecological modelling approach to compare the outcomes under climate change for plant biodiversity in Tasmania (all 2051 species) when new conservation reserves are established according to four contrasting reserve design strategies: connectivity; aggregation; representativeness; and a balanced approach. The most effective reserve design strategy under climate change depended on the specific conservation goal. New reserves focussed on improving representativeness most effectively promoted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6299906735696217322", "cites_id": ["6299906735696217322"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6oRDO8zDbVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
