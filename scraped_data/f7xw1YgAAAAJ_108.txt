It will do so by gap filling (eg, by stimulating and coordinating programs to improve the global coverage of in situ biodiversity monitoring sites) and by facilitating the integration of in situ and remote observations from multiple initiatives across multiple scales (Scholes et al. 2008). GEO BON recognizes that achieving such integration will, in some cases, require extensive use of various forms of modeling.A particular challenge Nowhere is the need for modeling more apparent than in relation to efforts to assess global loss of compositional diversity\u2014that is, the overall variety of biological elements at multiple levels of organization, from genes and species to communities and ecosystems.
