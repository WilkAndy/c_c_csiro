Model inter-comparisons are key in quantifying uncertainties and identifying avenues for model improvement but have been missing among the global biodiversity and ecosystem services modelling communities. The biodiversity and ecosystem services scenario-based inter-model comparison (BES-SIM) aims to fill this gap. We used global land-use and climate projections to simulate possible future impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services using a variety of models and a range of harmonized metrics.The goal of this paper is to reflect on the steps taken in BES-SIM, identify remaining methodological challenges, and suggest pathways for improvement. We identified five major groups of challenges; the need \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7095016686973308069", "cites_id": ["7095016686973308069"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419306183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pUyD9hWQdmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 16, "2023": 1}}
