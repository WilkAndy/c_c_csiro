Socolar et al.[2] have rightly recognised the fundamental importance of considering beta-diversity for conserving biodiversity, and clearly explain the various ways in which betadiversity may respond to contrasting ecological and anthropogenic forces. However, there are many ways in which beta-diversity already underpins much of modern conservation science and practice, although differences in terminology means that this may not always be explicit. Here, we highlight a variety of existing conservation approaches for which beta-diversity is central and can be used in any environment at multiple scales.A major oversight in the review by Socolar et al.[2] is the well-developed field of \u2018systematic conservation planning\u2019and the \u2018principle of complementarity\u2019, which recognises the diversity shared between sites, and is critical to all modern applications of spatial conservation prioritisation [3]. Complementarity is required to achieve efficient conservation solutions because the biodiversity represented by a set of conserved sites is not simply an accumulation of their individual richness values (alpha). Most studies applying conservation prioritisation software, such as Zonation or Marxan, do not mention betadiversity, but implicitly account for it"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=65692036991623049", "cites_id": ["65692036991623049"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex-Bush/publication/299123946_Current_Uses_of_Beta-Diversity_in_Biodiversity_Conservation_A_response_to_Socolar_et_al/links/59fb09fea6fdcca1f28fab06/Current-Uses-of-Beta-Diversity-in-Biodiversity-Conservation-A-response-to-Socolar-et-al.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iR91QY9i6QAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
