Vegetation condition modelling is increasingly being integrated into such analysis. Model complexity and model uncertainty are critical factors that must be addressed when tailoring vegetation condition modelling to individual applications. We describe three approaches that we have used to compare the effects of different landscape scenarios on vegetation condition. The first is a simple land\u2010use\u2013condition approach where vegetation condition is determined solely by land use. The second is a land\u2010use\u2013regeneration approach that introduces transition functions to model vegetation condition dynamics associated with land use change. The third is a threat\u2013regeneration approach, which models vegetation condition dynamics based on the interaction between regeneration and a range of mapped threats. The three approaches \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3307600859828229154", "cites_id": ["3307600859828229154"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-8903.2006.00291.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IpTWJHX15i0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
