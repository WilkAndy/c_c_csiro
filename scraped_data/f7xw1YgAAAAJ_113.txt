Three methods ol analysis were applied to the transect data: lhe Fixed-strip Transect. Variable-strip Transect and the Line Transect Methods. Whrle all methods tended to underestimate densitv the Variable-strio and Line Transect Methods perlormed much berter than the Fixed-strip Transect Method, because they attempted to overcome problems associated with varying detectability. However, the bias of estmates was not cbnstant and dilfered greatly beiween species and between seasons. These results demonstrate the need lor caulion in usinq transect methods to compare densities where the detectability of birds may dilter. lt-is concluded that no one method of censusing is appropriate to all species under all conditions and that combinations of different methods are required tor accurate estimatgs. sevcn spijcies, derived from intensive colourbancling and mapping.
