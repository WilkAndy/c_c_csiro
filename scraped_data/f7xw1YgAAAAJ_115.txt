Improving our understanding of links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across large spatial scales and rapid global change is a major priority to help identify management responses that will retain diverse, functioning systems. Here we address this challenge by linking projected changes in plant community composition and functional attributes (height, leaf area, seed mass) under climate change across Tasmania, Australia. Using correlative community\u2010level modeling, we found that projected changes in plant community composition were not consistently related to projected changes in community mean trait values. In contrast, we identified specific mechanisms through which alternative combinations of projected functional and compositional change across Tasmania could \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3970610377898102903", "cites_id": ["3970610377898102903"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-2384.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d5AY_BlxGjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
