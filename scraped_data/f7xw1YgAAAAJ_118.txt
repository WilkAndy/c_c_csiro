The degree to which species could tolerate environmental conditions outside their observed distributions may have a significant impact on the perceived extinction risk in ecological models. More information on this potential error is required to improve our confidence in management strategies.Australia.1983\u20132012.Plants.To quantify the scale and spatial patterns of this disparity, we estimated the existing tolerance to thermal extremes of 7,124 Australian plants, more than one\u2010third of the native continental flora, using data from cultivated records at 128 botanical gardens and nurseries.
