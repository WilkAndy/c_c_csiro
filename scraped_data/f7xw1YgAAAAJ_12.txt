The most popular strategy for such modelling has been to model distributions of individual species one at a time. Spatial modelling of biodiversity at the community level may, however, confer significant benefits for applications involving very large numbers of species, particularly if many of these species are recorded infrequently.  2 Community\u2010level modelling combines data from multiple species and produces information on spatial pattern in the distribution of biodiversity at a collective community level instead of, or in addition to, the level of individual species. Spatial outputs from community\u2010level modelling include predictive mapping of community types (groups of locations with similar species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 804, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10371375629146707138", "cites_id": ["10371375629146707138"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01149.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wtRuTy-H7o8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 9, "2007": 18, "2008": 30, "2009": 39, "2010": 32, "2011": 48, "2012": 58, "2013": 59, "2014": 58, "2015": 56, "2016": 56, "2017": 52, "2018": 49, "2019": 67, "2020": 44, "2021": 52, "2022": 53, "2023": 19}}
