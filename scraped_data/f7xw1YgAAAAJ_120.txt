Among the goals is increasing the integrity of ecosystems. The CBD is now seeking input toward a quantifiable definition of integrity and methods to track it globally. Here, we offer a schema for using Earth observations (EO) to monitor and evaluate global forest ecosystem integrity (EI). Our approach builds on three topics: the concept of EI, the use of satellite\u2010based EO, and the use of \u201cessential biodiversity variables\u201d to monitor and report on it. Within this schema, EI is a measure of the structure, function, and composition of an ecosystem relative to the range of variation determined by climatic\u2013geophysical environment. We use evaluation criteria to recommend eight potential indicators of EI that can be monitored around the globe using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1144979610168199101", "cites_id": ["1144979610168199101"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12822", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vQckm-PI4w8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 18, "2023": 6}}
