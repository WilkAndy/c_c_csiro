Threshold\u2010 and complementarity\u2010based approaches have been independently used to identify important sites for biodiversity. We brought together these approaches by performing a complementarity\u2010based analysis of irreplaceability in important bird and biodiversity areas (IBAs), which are sites identified using a threshold\u2010based approach. We determined whether irreplaceability values are higher inside than outside IBAs and whether any observed difference depends on known characteristics of the IBAs. We focused on 3 regions with comprehensive IBA inventories and bird distribution atlases: Australia, southern Africa, and Europe. Irreplaceability values were significantly higher inside than outside \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3103724625146691286", "cites_id": ["3103724625146691286"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1j6AMhqlEisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
