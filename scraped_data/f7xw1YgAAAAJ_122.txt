Here, we test the effects of current environmental gradients and geographical distance on regional species turnover. Using a new approach, we then interpret residual turnover patterns, unexplained by these factors.Native vegetation in the wheatbelt of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR).We fitted a generalized dissimilarity model of species turnover across 650 floristic inventory plots as a function of current climate, topography, soils and inter\u2010plot distances. We then decomposed the model errors into independent axes of residual variation, representing unexplained species turnover.
