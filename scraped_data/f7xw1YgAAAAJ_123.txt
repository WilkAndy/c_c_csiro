The project has linked millions of records for over 20,000 species of plants, vertebrates and invertebrates from SEWPaC\u2019s Australian Natural Heritage Assessment Tool (ANHAT) database, to state-of-the-art environmental layers, to map fine-scaled spatial patterns in the distribution of biodiversity across the entire Australian continent. The project\u2019s use of generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) has enabled best-available data on a wide variety of taxa, most of which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1023843388733915040", "cites_id": ["1023843388733915040"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP102983", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oP8dMyNsNQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
