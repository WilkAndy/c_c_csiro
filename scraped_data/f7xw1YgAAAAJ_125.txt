Models and scenarios can be used to help design the pathways to sustain a thriving nature and its ability to contribute to people. This approach has so far been hampered by the complexity associated with combining projections of pressures on, and subsequent responses from, biodiversity. Most previous assessments have projected continuous biodiversity declines and very few have identified pathways for reversing the loss of biodiversity without jeopardizing other objectives such as development or climate mitigation. The Bending The Curve initiative set out to advance quantitative modelling techniques towards ambitious scenarios for biodiversity. In this proof-of-concept analysis, we developed a modelling approach that demonstrates how global land use and biodiversity models can shed light on wedges able to bend the curve of biodiversity trends as affected by land-use change, the biggest current threat to biodiversity. In order to address the uncertainties associated with such pathways we used a multi-model framework and relied on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway/Representative Concentration Pathway scenario framework. This report describes the details of this modelling approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4272054237231413163", "cites_id": ["4272054237231413163"], "pub_url": "http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/15241/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q3dhx7FiSTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
