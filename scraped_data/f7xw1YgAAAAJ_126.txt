We here develop an indicator addressing just one of many possible dimensions of ecosystem resilience, by focusing on the capacity of ecosystems to retain biological diversity in the face of ongoing, and uncertain, climate change. The Bioclimatic Ecosystem Resilience Index (BERI) assesses the extent to which a given spatial configuration of natural habitat will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. The approach uses existing global modelling of spatial turnover in species composition within three broad biological groups (plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) to scale projected changes in composition under a plausible range of climate scenarios. These projections serve as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8198527677671125735", "cites_id": ["8198527677671125735"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X2030491X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:57LLNHwFx3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
