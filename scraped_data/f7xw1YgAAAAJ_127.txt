The use of modelling in biodiversity change observation, or monitoring, is just one of a number of roles that modelling can play in biodiversity assessment. These roles place different levels of emphasis on explanatory versus predictive modelling, and on modelling across space alone, versus across both space and time, either past-to-present or present-to-future. One of the most challenging, yet vitally important, applications of modelling to biodiversity monitoring involves mapping change in the distribution and retention of terrestrial biodiversity. Unlike many structural and functional attributes of ecosystems, most biological entities at the species and genetic levels of biodiversity cannot be readily detected through remote sensing. Estimating change in these levels of biodiversity across large spatial extents is therefore benefiting from advances in both species-level and community-level approaches to model-based integration of in situ biological observations and remotely sensed environmental data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2082214199938487106", "cites_id": ["2082214199938487106"], "pub_url": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28080/1001914.pdf#page=245", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QpObZciC5RwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
