In this article, we compare and discuss the different uses of four forecasting methods: (1) models that consider species individually, (2) niche-theory models that group species by habitat (more specifically, by environmental conditions under which a species can persist or does persist), (3) general circulation models and coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere\u2013biosphere models, and (4) species\u2013area curve models that consider all species or large aggregates of species. After outlining the different uses and limitations of these methods, we make eight primary suggestions for improving forecasts. We find that greater use of the fossil record and of modern genetic studies would improve forecasting methods. We note a Quaternary conundrum: While current empirical and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 773, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3738144071334968086", "cites_id": ["3738144071334968086"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/57/3/227/268444", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FjsnMzqO4DMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 12, "2008": 41, "2009": 42, "2010": 69, "2011": 58, "2012": 74, "2013": 64, "2014": 50, "2015": 48, "2016": 45, "2017": 46, "2018": 37, "2019": 37, "2020": 39, "2021": 38, "2022": 42, "2023": 6}}
