Centre for Water Policy Research, Armidale, Australia", "pages": "315-329", "abstract": "Selection of new conservation reserves requires data on the spatial distribution of elements of biodiversity. Biological field surveys are usually the only direct means of collecting such data. However, due to constraints of time and resources, biodiversity information collected by direct survey of large regions will normally contain significant gaps in geographical, temporal and taxonomic coverage. These gaps are often addressed by employing'surrogate'measures of biological distribution as a basis for selecting reserves. Surrogates include mapped land classifications derived from interpretation of aerial photography or satellite imagery, environmental classifications and ordinations derived by numerical pattern analysis of abiotic environmental surfaces, and predictive modelling of biological distributions derived by statistical analysis of biological survey data in relation to mapped environmental attributes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3861997321332458954", "cites_id": ["3861997321332458954"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3861997321332458954&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ygWIHRqSmDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
