However, few studies have examined the congruence of past, present and future refugia, or the spatiotemporal connectivity of these refugia. Our aim was to test the extent of overlap of refugia under Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), present (2015) and likely future climates (2100), for Tasmania's palaeoendemic flora. We then aimed to identify areas of high spatiotemporal refugia connectivity, as priority areas for conservation and management.Tasmania, Australia.We developed and applied a new community\u2010level approach to identifying refugia, based on generalized dissimilarity modelling of compositional turnover and a set of reference sites with known biodiversity value \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=915918465307077758", "cites_id": ["915918465307077758"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fmzZz_3-tQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
