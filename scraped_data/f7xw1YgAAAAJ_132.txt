We perform a continental\u2010scale test of the strength and direction of relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and both \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity.Location Continental Australia.Methods Species occurrence records were used to quantify the taxonomic \u03b1\u2010diversity of vascular plants in approximately 11,000 1 km \u00d7 1 km grid cells across Australia, and to calculate the average \u03b2\u2010diversity within a 10\u2010km radius around each cell. The magnitude and variability of monthly, MODIS\u2010derived remotely sensed GPP (2001\u201312) were summarized for continental Australia, as were rainfall and temperature over the same period. Generalized additive models were then used to test whether the magnitude or variability of GPP were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12959091345039435893", "cites_id": ["12959091345039435893"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dSjqCOvw17MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
