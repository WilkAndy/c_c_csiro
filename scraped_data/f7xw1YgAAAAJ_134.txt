Currently, the methods used to generate these predictive maps generally focus on deterministic processes and omit stochasticity and other uncertainty in model outputs. Here we present a novel approach to model the means and variance of assemblage properties.The western Swiss Alps.We propose a new approach to processing probabilistic predictions derived from stacked species distribution models (S\u2010SDMs) in order to predict and assess the uncertainty in predictions of community properties. We compare the utility of our novel approach with that of a traditional threshold\u2010based approach. We used data sampled in 2009 and 2010 from 192 sites in total for mountain butterfly communities spanning a large elevational gradient as a case study and evaluated the ability of our approach to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8853598563872996630", "cites_id": ["8853598563872996630"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fv2OR_xM3noJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
