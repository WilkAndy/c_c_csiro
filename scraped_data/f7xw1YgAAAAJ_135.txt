Duivenvoorden et al.(1) re-evaluated environmental explanations of beta diversity in light of Condit et al.'s (2) conclusion that environmental differences help account for Panama\u2019s beta diversity patterns. Duivenvoorden et al. noted that\" 59% of the variation in species similarity remained unexplained by either distance or environment\" and that large unexplained variation is typical for such studies in tropical forests.Absence of environmental/spatial explanation may implicate historical or other factors but is valid only if the search for environmental/spatial explanation was comprehensive. It is important therefore not to overinterpret Duivenvoorden et al.'s findings as implying that environment in general cannot explain much of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9424873709885611426", "cites_id": ["9424873709885611426"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9424873709885611426&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ol2mOrTgy4IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
