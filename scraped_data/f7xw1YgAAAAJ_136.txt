The number of studies applying GDM is expanding, with increasing recognition of its value in improving our understanding of the drivers of biodiversity patterns and in implementing a wide variety of spatial assessments relevant to biodiversity conservation. However, apart from the original presentation of the GDM technique, there has been little guidance available to users on applying GDM to different situations or on the key modelling decisions required.We present an accessible working guide to GDM. We describe the context for the development of GDM, present a simple statistical explanation of how model fitting works, and step through key considerations involved in data preparation, model fitting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14552741042647340128", "cites_id": ["14552741042647340128"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/GEB.13459", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YBQ-49-49ckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 15}}
