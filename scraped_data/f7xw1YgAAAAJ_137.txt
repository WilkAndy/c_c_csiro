Recent work has shifted the focus from spatially local (\u03b1\u2010diversity) to macroecological scales (\u03b2\u2010 and \u03b3\u2010diversity), emphasizing links between macroecological biodiversity and ecosystem functions (MB\u2013EF relationships). However, before the outcomes of MB\u2013EF analyses can be useful to real\u2010world decisions, empirical modeling needs to be developed for natural ecosystems, incorporating a broader range of data inputs, environmental change scenarios, underlying mechanisms, and predictions. We outline the key conceptual and technical challenges currently faced in developing such models and in testing and calibrating the relationships assumed in these models using data from real ecosystems. These challenges are explored in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3099387135916239060", "cites_id": ["3099387135916239060"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1OizyS08AysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
