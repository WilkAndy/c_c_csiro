In this study, variability due to plant species turnover was eliminated by focusing on the arthropods utilizing a single widely distributed plant species, Parkinsonia aculeata L. (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae). This enabled us to examine the effects of geography and climate on arthropod species turnover.Neotropics (USA to Argentina).A statistical approach was used to determine whether arthropod assemblages across the range of P. aculeata differed significantly between biogeographical areas. We determined whether host\u2010specific arthropods have more restricted ranges, contributing to higher species turnover. Finally, generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) was used to correlate significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10961893614448898584", "cites_id": ["10961893614448898584"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GHLZ6il4IJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
