However, the foundational assumption\u2014that drivers of spatial gradients of species composition also drive temporal changes in diversity\u2014rarely is tested. Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were \u223c72% as accurate as \u201ctime-for-time\u201d predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 650, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15876566143655660814", "cites_id": ["15876566143655660814"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1220228110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ds2WPcrkVNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 24, "2015": 35, "2016": 48, "2017": 54, "2018": 68, "2019": 62, "2020": 84, "2021": 106, "2022": 108, "2023": 51}}
