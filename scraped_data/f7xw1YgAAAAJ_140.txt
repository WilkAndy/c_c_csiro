One such indicator, the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII), estimates how the average abundance of the native terrestrial species in a region compares with their abundances in the absence of pronounced human impacts. We produced annual maps of modelled BII at 30-arc-second resolution (roughly 1 km at the equator) across tropical and subtropical forested biomes, by combining annual data on land use, human population density and road networks, and statistical models of how these variables affect overall abundance and compositional similarity of plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Across tropical and subtropical biomes, BII fell by an average of 1.9 percentage points between 2001 and 2012, with 81 countries seeing an average reduction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16496682794522498910", "cites_id": ["16496682794522498910"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98811-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XtfPM5n97-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
