Some indicators are better suited to predicting future change, others are more appropriate for evaluating past actions, but this is seldom made explicit. We developed a conceptual model for assigning biodiversity indicators to appropriate functions based on a common approach used in economics. Using the model, indicators can be classified as leading (indicators that change before the subject of interest, informing preventative actions), coincident (indicators that measure the subject of interest), or lagging (indicators that change after the subject of interest has changed and thus can be used to evaluate past actions). We classified indicators based on ecological theory on biodiversity response times and management objectives in 2 case studies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3959179673726060324", "cites_id": ["3959179673726060324"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13575", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JIdjxu_U8TYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
