Linking biodiversity indicators with national economic accounts provides a means of mainstreaming biodiversity into economic planning and monitoring processes. Here we examine the various strategies for biodiversity indicators to be linked into national economic accounts, specifically the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EEA) framework. We present what has been achieved in practice, using various case studies from across the world. These case studies demonstrate the potential of economic accounting as an integrating, mainstreaming framework that explicitly considers biodiversity. With the right indicators for the different components of biodiversity and scales of biological organisation, this can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11155974669152911898", "cites_id": ["11155974669152911898"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901120313769", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GoIdztr70ZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
