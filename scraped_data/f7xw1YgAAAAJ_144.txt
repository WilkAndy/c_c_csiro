Surrogates are assumed to represent spatial patterns in the distribution of biodiversity, yet the validity of this assumption is rarely evaluated. Here, we use data from new biological surveys targeting poorly known taxonomic groups across sparsely surveyed landscapes to test: (1) the performance of established and novel surrogates; and (2) the value of targeted survey data in further improving surrogate effectiveness.Continental Australia.Surrogates were derived from either mapped land classifications (bioregions, vegetation types), or models of spatial turnover in biodiversity composition. Models were derived by linking best\u2010available biological observations to high\u2010resolution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7313393664129328883", "cites_id": ["7313393664129328883"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12766", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:82YFHcpkfmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
