The Biodiversity Forecasting Tool (BFT) helps answer three important questions relating to regional biodiversity persistence: \u2018how much\u2019 biodiversity can persist for a given land-management scenario; \u2018what\u2019 habitats to focus conservation effort on; and \u2018where\u2019 in the landscape to undertake conservation action. The tool integrates fine-scaled variability in vegetation composition and structure with spatial context, which is critical for ensuring the viability of populations. Thus, a raster data framework is employed which deems each location or gridcell in a landscape as contributing to biodiversity benefits to various degrees. At its simplest, just two spatial inputs, vegetation community types and vegetation condition, are needed.
