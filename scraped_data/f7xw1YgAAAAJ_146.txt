Decision makers often rely on expert judgement to fill knowledge gaps, but are rarely able to engage with sufficiently large and diverse groups of specialists. To improve understanding of the perspectives of thousands of biodiversity experts worldwide, we conducted a survey and asked experts to focus on the taxa and freshwater, terrestrial, or marine ecosystem with which they are most familiar. We found several points of overwhelming consensus (for instance, multiple drivers of biodiversity loss interact synergistically) and important demographic and geographic differences in specialists\u2019 perspectives and estimates. Experts from groups that are underrepresented in biodiversity science, including women and those from the Global South, recommended different priorities for conservation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8577369467724261619", "cites_id": ["8577369467724261619"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.2536", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:82j8BhbwCHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 15}}
