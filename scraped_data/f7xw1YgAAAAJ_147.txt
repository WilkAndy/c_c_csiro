How is biodiversity responding to the variety of human pressures? Are the management policies put into place effective to tackle the impact of those pressures? While the scientific community has been addressing these questions for decades, the information gap in biodiversity science remains a major obstacle for reducing the large uncertainties associated with answering those questions. Technological advances, collection of data by an increasing number of scientists and volunteer citizens, and increased access to Earth observations (EO) should help reduce this gap. Yet quantitative information is still limited, as has been its ability to inform important international commitments such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in response to the global biodiversity crisis (Tittensor et al. 2014). Data collection and monitoring protocols are often adopted by scientists, public administrations, and environmental organizations with no effective international coordination, and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7399484008932310705", "cites_id": ["7399484008932310705"], "pub_url": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/39986/1/2020_Book_RemoteSensingOfPlantBiodiversi.pdf#page=499", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sf6XgYA_sGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 10, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
