The gdm package currently provides basic functions to fit, summarize, and plot Generalized Dissimilarity Models and to make predictions (in both space and time) and map biological patterns by transforming environmental predictor variables. Future updates will incorporate support for genomic data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10600217764978758965", "cites_id": ["10600217764978758965"], "pub_url": "https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-02-24/web/packages/gdm/gdm.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NRVYF-WJG5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
