However, for many taxa, in many regions, issues with currently available biological data curtail the application of spatial biodiversity models. Here we develop techniques to model spatial patterns of diverse subterranean invertebrate fauna (troglofauna and stygofauna) in the Pilbara region, to better inform biodiversity planning and management for these groups. In this context, the available data are highly biased in their distribution, with specimens often identified only at coarse taxonomic resolution, and individual community surveys sampling a relatively small proportion of the total assemblage at a location.Pilbara bioregion, NW Australia.To overcome the challenges presented by the subterranean fauna data sets, we developed a community\u2010level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4028398523520601828", "cites_id": ["4028398523520601828"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12852", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5E4nIB2_5zcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
