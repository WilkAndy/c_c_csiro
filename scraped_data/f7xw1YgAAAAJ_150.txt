Here, we present a multi-model analysis to assess the impacts of land-use and climate change from 1900 to 2050. During the 20th century provisioning services increased, but biodiversity and regulating services decreased. Similar trade-offs are projected for the coming decades, but they may be attenuated in a sustainability scenario. Future biodiversity loss from land-use change is projected to keep up with historical rates or reduce slightly, whereas losses due to climate change are projected to increase greatly. Renewed efforts are needed by governments to meet the 2050 vision of the Convention on Biological Diversity.Development pathways exist that allow for a reduction of the rates of biodiversity loss from land-use change and improvement in regulating services but climate change poses an increasing challenge."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7556297834835952418", "cites_id": ["7556297834835952418"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.031716.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IkNzhthc3WgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
