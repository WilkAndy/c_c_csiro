However the two main sources of data used to account for biodiversity patterns in such assessments \u2013 i.e. ecoregional boundaries, and vertebrate species ranges \u2013 are typically delineated at a much coarser resolution than the spatial grain of key ecological processes shaping both land-use and biological distributions at landscape scale. Species distribution modelling provides one widely used means of refining the resolution of mapped species distributions, but is limited to a subset of species which is biased both taxonomically and geographically, with some regions of the world lacking adequate data to generate reliable models even for better-known biological groups.Macroecological modelling of collective properties of biodiversity (e.g. alpha and beta diversity) as a correlative function of environmental predictors offers an alternative, yet highly complementary, approach to refining the spatial resolution with which patterns in the distribution of biodiversity can be mapped across our planet. Here we introduce a new capability \u2013 BILBI (the Biogeographic Infrastructure for Large-scaled Biodiversity Indicators) \u2013 which has implemented this approach by integrating advances in macroecological modelling, biodiversity informatics, remote sensing and high-performance computing to assess spatial-temporal change in biodiversity at ~1km grid resolution across the entire terrestrial surface of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7480341971028503719", "cites_id": ["7480341971028503719"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/309377.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p2yZ3WODz2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
