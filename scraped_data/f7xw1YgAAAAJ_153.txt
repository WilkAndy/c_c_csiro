Here we present a novel framework for understanding possible changes in species' abundance structures within communities under climate change. We demonstrate this using comprehensive survey and environmental data from 1748 woody plant communities across southeast Queensland, Australia, to model rank\u2010abundance distributions (RADs) under current and future climates. Under current conditions, the models predicted RADs consistent with the region's dominant vegetation types. We demonstrate that under a business as usual climate scenario, total abundance and richness may decline in subtropical rainforest and shrubby heath, and increase in dry sclerophyll forests. Despite these opposing trends, we predicted evenness in the distribution of abundances between species to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7400694103613191513", "cites_id": ["7400694103613191513"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.03552", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WTUxoROMtGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
