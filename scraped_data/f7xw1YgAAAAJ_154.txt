Comparative phylogeographic analysis provides an effective tool for locating such refugia, as long-term retention of one or more populations within a refugial landscape will generate unique genetic lineages. The ranges of the western Gulf region of northern Australia are thought to represent a significant arid-zone refugium, in which case low-dispersal organisms should have strong phylogeographic structure across the region. To test for this, we conducted extensive sampling of three species of Gehyra geckos and analysed diversity for mitochondrial DNA and eight nuclear loci. These analyses revealed congruent and high phylogeographic diversity, especially, but not exclusively, in rock-restricted species. This finding, and other recent phylogeographic evidence, demonstrates that these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8626568892787558761", "cites_id": ["8626568892787558761"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ZO/ZO17079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aYkJ1bO6t3cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
