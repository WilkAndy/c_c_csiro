Where conditions are conducive, multi-stakeholder collaboration offers the advantages of averting conflict. It also offers a platform for the development of a shared vision for a region, and a common space for generating synergistic, place-specific innovations to achieve that vision. Spatial modelling assists in the process, evaluating and visualizing cumulative impacts arising from sets of landuse and management changes across a region.The Southern Mallee Guidelines was an offset scheme in the Southern Mallee region of NSW, Australia, developed to address jointly the agricultural development and biodiversity conservation concerns in the region. The scheme provided a timely example of place-specific response to tackling the complexity of land clearing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5471237542422066421", "cites_id": ["5471237542422066421"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837716301272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9TTZlY697UsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
