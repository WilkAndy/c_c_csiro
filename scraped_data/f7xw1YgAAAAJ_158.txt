Understanding compositional patterns in aquatic biota is a useful step towards better management of aquatic ecosystems. We used generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to predict compositional turnover in riverine invertebrate fauna (primarily insects) as a function of environment. Conceptual understanding of major drivers of aquatic invertebrate species distribution helped decide which predictor variables to source and include. Five groups of environmental variables\u2014waterscape, local habitat, climate, landscape and disturbance\u2014were derived from either spatial layers or in situ (site) measurements. Predictive models and variance partitioning tests of variable groups demonstrated the importance of representing all conceptual drivers of ecological pattern and process.
