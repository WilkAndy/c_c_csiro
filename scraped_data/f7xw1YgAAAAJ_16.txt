Ecological sub\u2010disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub\u2010disciplines hampers potential meta\u2010analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo\u2010diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information.Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 627, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4402675056517873935", "cites_id": ["4402675056517873935"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D4E4NaNxGT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 49, "2018": 91, "2019": 82, "2020": 97, "2021": 126, "2022": 114, "2023": 53}}
