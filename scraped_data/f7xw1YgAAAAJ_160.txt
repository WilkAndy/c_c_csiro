Yet it should be possible for species and ecosystems to respond to environmental change to some degree via existing ecological and evolutionary processes. These processes include genetic adaptation but also phenotypic and behavioural plasticity, including changes in dispersal patterns that result in shifts in species\u2019 distributions (Donnelly et al. 2012; Hughes et al. 2010; Lande 2009; Lawler 2009). Our understanding of how to support these processes is limited, but they all require variability (genetic, phenotypic or behavioural) and variability is usually greater in larger populations (Hartl and Clark 2007; Lacy 1997). In addition, changes in dispersal patterns will only be possible if the broader landscape between populations is sufficiently permeable to allow movements of native species (Doerr et al. 2011a). Thus, the most common approach to climate adaptation for terrestrial biodiversity is to scale up from traditional site-based management to planning and managing at landscape scales (Alexandra 2012; Pettorelli 2012). In landscape design and management, larger population sizes and greater permeability may both be achieved through functionally linking smaller patches of native vegetation, reducing threats from the \u2018matrix\u2019(the wider landscape between patches), and increasing the nativeness of the matrix itself (Bennett 2004; Hilty et al. 2006; Mackey et al. 2010).However, philosophies and approaches to landscape design and management differ widely, influenced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9230715735083950082", "cites_id": ["9230715735083950082"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronica-Doerr/publication/262936041_Designing_landscapes_for_biodiversity_under_climate_change_final_report_National_Climate_Change_Adaptation_Research_Facility_Gold_Coast/links/5580e1e108ae47061e5f3b13/Designing-landscapes-for-biodiversity-under-climate-change-final-report-National-Climate-Change-Adaptation-Research-Facility-Gold-Coast.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AqBJ_A0XGoAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
