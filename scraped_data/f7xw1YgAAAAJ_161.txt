Within\u2010 and between\u2010class dissimilarities were compiled for each level to elucidate species compositional patterns. Randomized subsampling was used to determine the minimum site sampling intensity for each hierarchy level, and the effects of lumping and splitting illustrated for several classes.Results:  Consistent dissimilarity estimates were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5497834089034748069", "cites_id": ["5497834089034748069"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2010.01085.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pRDzpvk6TEwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
