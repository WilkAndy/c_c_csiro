Two types of biodiversity assessment in particular are attracting growing interest: one focused on understanding past\u2010to\u2010present change (environmental accounting) and another focused on understanding likely present\u2010to\u2010future changes under proposed scenarios of future actions (cumulative impact assessment of scenarios). Here we highlight the potential benefits of improving the links between environmental accounting and scenario\u2010based cumulative impact assessment for biodiversity, using a case study for subterranean fauna in the Pilbara region of Australia. Using a flexible and comprehensive model\u2010based analytical approach, we assessed expected change in biodiversity persistence given past development, and likely change to 2100 under a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16894721699655924432", "cites_id": ["16894721699655924432"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13506", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0DoTr98bduoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 6}}
