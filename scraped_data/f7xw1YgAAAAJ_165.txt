Scenarios ranged from strategic site assessment where proposals were ranked on scores from site\u2010scale data and a priori regional value to systematic regional assessment with selection of proposals using optimization algorithms. The selection scenarios were simulated using proposals from a conservation investment program in South\u2010eastern Australia. All selection scenarios provided a positive gain in biodiversity compared with selecting no proposals. Regional assessments provided \u223c4% gain in the biodiversity index over site assessments. The performance of scenarios using optimization was similar to scenarios using rankings. A framework for integrating site and regional approaches for selecting proposals for conservation management is proposed, where proposals are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13556744351160023880", "cites_id": ["13556744351160023880"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00135.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SDutISk7I7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
