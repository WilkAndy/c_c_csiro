It is also possible that species will respond to changes in climate by shifting their physiological tolerances, through genetic adaptation. How these processes influence biodiversity outcomes will be crucial in determining the most suitable management responses to retain diversity into the future. Here we assess how accounting for physiological tolerances, genetic adaptation and community assembly processes such as species replacement, influence projected climate change outcomes for the flora of Tasmania (all 2051 plant species). We incorporate these processes into the M\u2010SET metacommunity model and compare four different assumptions of species niches: realized niches, broader physiological tolerances and low or high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=321701064214472159", "cites_id": ["321701064214472159"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.03994", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:32Ve2GnpdgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
