It conserves examples of Australia's natural landscapes and native plants and animals which is important as our environment is under pressure from future land-use and climate change.Australia has obligations under the International Convention on Biological Diversity including to meet Aichi Target 11, which requires that at least 17 per cent of terrestrial land be conserved through an ecologically representative and well connected system of protected areas by 2020. Over 17 per cent of Australia\u2019s landmass is now included in the National Reserve System (NRS), however this does not mean that the NRS fully protects the complete range of ecological environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9796999163804511218", "cites_id": ["9796999163804511218"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9796999163804511218&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8utdL9Xu9YcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
