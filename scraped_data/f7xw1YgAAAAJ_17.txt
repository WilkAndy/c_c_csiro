The choice of grain size (resolution) of environmental layers used in modelling is one important factor that may affect predictions. We applied 10 distinct modelling techniques to presence\u2010only data for 50 species in five different regions, to test whether: (1) a 10\u2010fold coarsening of resolution affects predictive performance of SDMs, and (2) any observed effects are dependent on the type of region, modelling technique, or species considered. Results show that a 10 times change in grain size does not severely affect predictions from species distribution models. The overall trend is towards degradation of model performance, but improvement can also be observed. Changing grain size does not equally affect models across regions, techniques, and species types. The strongest effect is on regions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 624, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=844421750580381509", "cites_id": ["844421750580381509"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00342.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RQf1sxv9twsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 22, "2009": 31, "2010": 32, "2011": 43, "2012": 47, "2013": 43, "2014": 52, "2015": 46, "2016": 50, "2017": 42, "2018": 41, "2019": 38, "2020": 36, "2021": 40, "2022": 31, "2023": 18}}
