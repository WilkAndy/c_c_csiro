If this work is to be effective in contributing to the conservation of the State's biological diversity, some hard questions have to be asked about the types ofdata that are most valuable for planning, the limitations ofthese databases as reflections of the whole biota, and the procedures that are needed to guide decisions on protection measures. We describe the major types of data being compiled and summarise the limitations of the available databases as pictures of the distribution of biodiversity. We also outline some of the ways in which these limitations can be minimised or accounted for\" We suggest four principles for selecting protected areas to make them most effective in conserving biodiversity. Finally, we outline a new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2984568069101885982", "cites_id": ["2984568069101885982"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/ielapa.950807732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HprKjthQaykJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
