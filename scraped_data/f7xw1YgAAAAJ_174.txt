Secondly, we generated spatially-explicit, continuous, landscape-scale models of these functional groups, accompanied by maps of the model residuals to show uncertainty.Using a case study from New South Wales, Australia, we aggregated floristic observations from 6806 sites into four common plant growth forms (trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs) representing four different functional groups \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16171328483651558330", "cites_id": ["16171328483651558330"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-021-01221-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uhs1lpMZbOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
