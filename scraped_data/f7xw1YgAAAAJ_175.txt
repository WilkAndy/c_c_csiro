Such is the power and scale of our technology and consumption, the decisions we take today will determine the course of Earth\u2019s environment in the coming century, the extent to which planetary boundaries are breached, and how much ofliving nature\u2013the outcome of billions of years of evolutionary, ecological and biological processes\u2013will remain and in what condition (Rockstr\u00f6m et al. 2009). The time has come when society needs to think big and scale-up its responses to match the magnitude of the challenge we face in keeping nature functional and diverse in the 21st century. This point was made clear in a recent OECD (2012) report \u2018\u2026 the sheer scale of economic and population growth has overwhelmed the pace of progress in curbing environmental pressures. Progress on an incremental, piecemeal, business-as-usual basis in the coming decades will not be enough\u2026 urgent and holistic action is needed now.\u2019Connectivity conservation has emerged out of many decades of conservation science and practice as a response to the biodiversity challenge of the Anthropocene (Crooks and Sanjayan 2006). Its scientific origins date back to theories ofisland biogeography and metapopulation ecology where the roles of connectivity and habitat quality are combined (MacArthur and Wilson 1967). It reframes conventional conservation planning and management in terms of goals that are based on the long-term needs of species and ecosystems, recognising that conservation outcomes are required on a landscape-wide basis, inclusive of many \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11182999128795627846", "cites_id": ["11182999128795627846"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tqCY_Sj1GBoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA233&dq=info:RsFdI3X-MZsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jek7P9DmvT&sig=sblZ9PGZKQku8gm-fh9xw2IQ1XA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RsFdI3X-MZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
