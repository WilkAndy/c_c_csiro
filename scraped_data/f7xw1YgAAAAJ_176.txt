The goals of this study were to predict how climate change may impact these ecological communities in south-eastern Australia, and develop recommendations for adapting conservation and management efforts towards better outcomes for biodiversity under climate change. We combined an expert knowledge approach (including a workshop with over 20 TGE experts) with two types of community-level spatial modelling (using artificial neural networks, ANN, and generalised dissimilarity modelling, GDM) to inform management responses. We focused on the following questions:(1) What are the structuring ecological processes in TGE?(2) How are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13321556621971880655", "cites_id": ["13321556621971880655"], "pub_url": "https://research.csiro.au/climate/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2016/03/13C_CAF-Working-Paper-13C.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z_riwyqt37gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
