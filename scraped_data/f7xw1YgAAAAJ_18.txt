In species distribution modelling, various statistical methods are used that combine species occurrence data with environmental spatial data layers to predict the suitability of any site for that species. While the number of data sharing initiatives involving species\u2019 occurrences in the scientific community has increased dramatically over the past few years, various data quality and methodological concerns related to using these data for species distribution modelling have not been addressed adequately.  2 We evaluated how uncertainty in georeferences and associated locational error in occurrences influence species distribution modelling using two treatments: (1) a control treatment where models were calibrated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 567, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9717735214295147508", "cites_id": ["9717735214295147508"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01408.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9ONdzbBU3IYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 25, "2010": 25, "2011": 41, "2012": 34, "2013": 50, "2014": 38, "2015": 38, "2016": 43, "2017": 40, "2018": 46, "2019": 37, "2020": 39, "2021": 46, "2022": 33, "2023": 22}}
