Conversely, correlative ecological niche models rely on the assumption that the range of environmental conditions encompassed by a species\u2019 geographic distribution accurately reflects their environmental tolerances, including community\u2010level approaches like generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). We extend GDM to better understand what effect broader environmental tolerances could have on compositional turnover under climate change.We show how GDM can be adjusted as a function of best\u2010available estimates of the average ratio between realized and potential niche widths to modify projected temporal turnover.
