My involvement with biodiversity monitoring began before the term \u2018biodiversity\u2019was even coined, when I studied the ecology and conservation status of the Rufous Scrub-bird (Atrichornis rufescens) for my PhD thesis (Ferrier 1984). As part of this work, I developed a methodology for monitoring change in the abundance of this rare species, based on counts of calling males made along walked transects. This technique was relatively sophisticated in accounting for the effects of season, time of day, weather, topography and habitat on the detectability of individual birds. It was, however, a methodology designed to answer some very specific questions relating to the conservation management of a single species within a set of relatively small geographical areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1718592806615900980", "cites_id": ["1718592806615900980"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=w7N5TwY94dQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA63&dq=info:NOPhVw2r2RcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UyUsaD2hpT&sig=49a1cJO3dPuFJYSdjjjnxa0rENg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NOPhVw2r2RcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
