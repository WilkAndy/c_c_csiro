As the \u2018back yard\u2019for millions of people, they represent the quintessential Australian forest environment, and contain the world\u2019s tallest angiosperms. They are also at the forefront of public perception because of conflicts over conservation versus timber extraction, and the bushfire threat, never more clearly demonstrated than in Victoria in February 2009. And yet this status, and that of many other eucalypt-dominated forest ecosystems in the south-east, is precarious, and the challenges facing conservation management of sclerophyll forests are especially acute in south-eastern Australia.A combination of literature review, expert workshop and modelling was used to assess the likely impacts of climate change on the biodiversity of the sclerophyll forests and associated communities of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1388673887656816370", "cites_id": ["1388673887656816370"], "pub_url": "https://research.csiro.au/climate/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2016/03/13A_CAF-Working-Paper-13A.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8i6lFouPRRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
