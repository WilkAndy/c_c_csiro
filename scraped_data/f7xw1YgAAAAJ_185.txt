Our specific interest was to test the conventional wisdom that existing survey data on plants and animals, and environmental products from satellite imagery collected for different purposes could be readily used to identify areas in the landscape where monitoring of biodiversity was a priority. If this proved to be true, we believe that the commercial benefits would be substantial as the costs of data gathering would be less, the large investment already associated with obtaining these datasets would be value-added and the maps of priority produced from the study would help land managers to target areas for monitoring biodiversity.
