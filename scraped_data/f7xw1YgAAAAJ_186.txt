It is one of nine reports on Australia\u2019s biodiversity and the NRS that the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities is addressing on this topic, using four biomes as case studies (savanna woodlands and grasslands biome, Liedloff et al. 2012; sclerophyll forests of south-eastern Australia, House et al. 2012; temperate grasslands and grassy woodlands, Prober et al. 2012) and four approaches to climate modelling applied on each biome where scientifically meaningful (climate downscaling, Harwood et al. 2012; generalised dissimilarity modelling for biomes, Ferrier et al. 2012; artificial neural networks modelling for biomes, Hilbert and Fletcher 2012; Bayesian belief network modelling of buffel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=772663123510572653", "cites_id": ["772663123510572653"], "pub_url": "https://research.csiro.au/climate/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2016/03/13D_CAF-Working-Paper-13D.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bTbkXwQNuQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
