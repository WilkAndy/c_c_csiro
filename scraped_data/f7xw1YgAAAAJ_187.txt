Environmental data is typically available for all areas but may be a weak biodiversity surrogate. Species records may be a good surrogate for other species, but typically are not available for all areas. These two forms of information can be combined by 1) summarising biotic information as compositional dissimilarities among areas, 2) linking observed dissimilarities to observed environmental differences, and then 3) using calculated environmental differences for new areas to assess biotic turnover. Approaches to this problem include ordination and dissimilarity/distance regression. Examples of both, using biodiversity data from Panama, highlight the advantages of using realistic models linking dissimilarity to environmental variation. While measured environmental variation explains Panama dissimilarities well, the ordination approach suggests that there are\" missing\" environmental variables that would increase explanation of biotic turnover among areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3773603492530212315", "cites_id": ["3773603492530212315"], "pub_url": "https://media.australian.museum/media/dd/Uploads/Documents/28679/D.%20P.%20Faith%2C%20S.%20Ferrier%2C%20Australian%20Museum%20Online%20(2002).cc0f6fd.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:281vD2KIXjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
