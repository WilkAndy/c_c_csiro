Tracking changes in biodiversity through ecosystem accounting provides this important information in a systematic way and readily enables linking to other relevant environmental and economic data to provide an integrated perspective. We derived biodiversity accounts for the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, Australia's largest catchment. We assessed biodiversity change from 2010 to 2015 for all vascular plants, all waterbirds, and 10 focal species. We applied a scalable habitat\u2010based assessment approach that combined expected patterns in the distribution of biodiversity from spatial biodiversity models with a time series of spatially complete data on habitat condition derived from remote sensing. Changes in biodiversity from 2010 to 2015 varied across \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4338984743247795778", "cites_id": ["4338984743247795778"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13915", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QtYfk6IrNzwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
