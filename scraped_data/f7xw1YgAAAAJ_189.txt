These trends are expected to continue in the future as the world continues to develop without much consideration of the role that nature plays in sustaining human livelihoods. Scenarios and models can be important tools to help policy- and decision-makers foresee the impact of their decisions; thus, increasing capacity in creating such models and scenarios is of utmost importance. However, postgraduate training schools that focus on this topic are still rare. Here we present and reflect on the experience of the S\u00e3o Paulo School of Advanced Science on Scenarios and Modelling on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to Support Human Well-Being (SPSAS Scenarios). In addition, we introduce the Special Issue of Biota Neotropica that resulted from the activities taking place during the SPSAS Scenarios. In total, nine case studies emerged from the activities carried out during SPSAS Scenarios. These focused on a variety of ecosystems, their current drivers of change and expected trends, as well as on the development of alternative positive scenarios applying the recently developed Nature Futures Framework. We emphasize the need to increase capacity in scenario and modelling skills in order to address some of the existing gaps in producing policy-relevant scenarios and models for biodiversity and ecosystem services."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10385890948382305706", "cites_id": ["10385890948382305706"], "pub_url": "https://www.scielo.br/j/bn/a/cR7XXKr6DMqPL5tdB8KK8Pb/abstract/?lang=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qq1FbsoYIpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
