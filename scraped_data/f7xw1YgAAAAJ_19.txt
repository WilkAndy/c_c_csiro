Practitioners need more reliable predictions to integrate into conservation planning (e.g. reserve design and management).  2 Most models still largely ignore or inappropriately take into account important features of species\u2019 distributions, such as spatial autocorrelation, dispersal and migration, biotic and environmental interactions. Whether distributions of natural communities or ecosystems are better modelled by assembling individual species\u2019 predictions in a bottom\u2010up approach or modelled as collective entities is another important issue. An international workshop was organized to address these issues.  3 We discuss more specifically six issues in a methodological framework for generalized regression: (i) links with ecological theory; (ii \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 549, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7226169435931724026", "cites_id": ["7226169435931724026"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01164.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-sh-69CCSGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 17, "2008": 46, "2009": 43, "2010": 50, "2011": 42, "2012": 39, "2013": 26, "2014": 33, "2015": 22, "2016": 34, "2017": 31, "2018": 37, "2019": 22, "2020": 27, "2021": 24, "2022": 39, "2023": 9}}
