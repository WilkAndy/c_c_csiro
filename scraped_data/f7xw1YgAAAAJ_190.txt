The work here contributed directly to an analysis of the future of the National Reserve System but is broadly applicable and has been subsequently applied at different spatial scales.Global Circulation Models produce projections of climate change at fairly coarse grid scales which are inadequate for the representation of many biological processes. The OzClim portal allows the user to download climate projections which have been rigorously downscaled to a 0.25 (25 km) resolution. Here we describe the use of these data as inputs to ANUCLIM software to further statistically downscale the projections based on current climate surfaces and height above sea level.
