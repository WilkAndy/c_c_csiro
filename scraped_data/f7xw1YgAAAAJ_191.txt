The Convention on Biological Diversity aims to achieve the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of its components with fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from genetic resources. Australia\u2019s National Reserve System (NRS) is one of many actions arising from the national strategy to address the conservation of biodiversity.The implementation framework for the NRS (NRM Ministerial Council 2005) has a foundation in systematic conservation planning (Margules and Pressey 2000) which recognises that surrogate information about the spatial patterning of biodiversity is needed in setting priorities and targets, and to monitor efficiency and progress. The NRS program aims to use \u2018the best available surrogates which best reflect the distribution of biodiversity in the landscape\u2019. A comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) system of protected areas is a goal of the NRS through the collective efforts of the states, territories, the Commonwealth Government, and non-government organisations involved in acquisition and covenanting programs. This goal represents a framework for identifying gaps and setting priorities for the strategic acquisition of new areas to achieve:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11694540478504123765", "cites_id": ["11694540478504123765"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=80ea6bb389c303e308750b581bdbe7e5d1d1f308#page=160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dT2q2JpaS6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
