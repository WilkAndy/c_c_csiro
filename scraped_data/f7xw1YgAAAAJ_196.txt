Here we develop a repeatable indicator for measuring the capacity of landscapes to retain biodiversity under a range of plausible climate futures, as a function of the condition and spatial configuration of native habitat.The Spatial Resilience Index extends an existing approach to assessing the potential for biodiversity associated with any location in a region to access suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape under climate change, incorporating multiple dispersal rates integrated over time and an optimised spatial structure. Derivation of the indicator is demonstrated for an Australian case study, covering the entire State of New South Wales, drawing on existing spatial datasets and models.Mapping of the Spatial Resilience Index across New South \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9039245152882272503", "cites_id": ["9039245152882272503"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-022-01534-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9yg4F5PZcX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
