Though remote sensing has been seen as a promising and cost-effective proxy for estimating plant diversity, there is a lack of quantitative studies on how confidently plant diversity can be inferred from spaceborne hyperspectral data. In this study, we assessed the ability of hyperspectral data captured by the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) for estimating plant species richness in the Southern Tablelands and Snowy Mountains regions in southeast Australia. Spectral features were firstly extracted from DESIS spectra with principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and partial least squares analysis. Then regression was conducted between the extracted features and plant species richness with ordinary least squares regression, kernel ridge regression, and Gaussian process regression \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15166638192758563445", "cites_id": ["15166638192758563445"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9883033/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dSI_fBS5etIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
