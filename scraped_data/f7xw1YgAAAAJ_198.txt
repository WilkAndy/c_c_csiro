This analysis contrasts with other global assessments that show the extent of areas important for ecological integrity to be at least an order of magnitude higher (Newbold et al., 2016; Watson et al., 2016a; Beyer et al., 2020; Grantham et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Mokany et al., 2020; Riggio et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020; De Palma et al., 2021). Plumptre et al.(2021) further argue their methodology and findings can inform Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) delineation.We believe the methodology used by Plumptre et al. is highly problematic when it comes to scoping sites in relation to ecological integrity. We provide reasons why their methodology is inappropriate for the scoping of KBA site identification (IUCN, 2016). We urge readers of Plumptre et al.(2021) to consider carefully their interpretations of data and underlying ecological theory, the problems inherent in the methodology employed in the analysis, and how the results can be misrepresented in important and ongoing global policy discussions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4513029495255191790,16740585710166843367,18231934802881242303", "cites_id": ["4513029495255191790", "16740585710166843367", "18231934802881242303"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.730546/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7tCLNWqAoT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
