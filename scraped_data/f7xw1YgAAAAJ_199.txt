The model of compositional similarity between pairs of sites in the PREDICTS database (ie, the asymmetric Jaccard\u2019s similarity of species abundances between a baseline site\u2014minimally-used primary vegetation\u2014and another site in the same study), could not be simplified, as the factor combining land use and land-use intensity interacted significantly with the three covariates (human population density, road density at the 50 km scale and road density at the 1 km scale: all p< 0.01 according to permuted likelihood ratio tests). In the model of total site-level abundance of organisms (ie, at a site, the sum of abundance of all species sampled), the land-use factor interacted significantly with both human population density (\u03c72= 22.23, df= 10, p< 0.05) and road density at the 50km scale \u03c72= 25.10, df= 10, p< 0.01). Road density at 1 km was not maintained in the model for total abundance. TheR2 values for the models of compositional similarity and total abundance were 0.56 and 0.67 respectively 51, 52. See the \u201cSupplementary Material\u201d for additional R2 values and predictive performance. Human dominated land uses often had significantly lower diversity than in minimally-used primary vegetation (when all other variables were set to mean levels), particularly in terms of compositional similarity (See the \u201cSupplementary Material\u201d for full model coefficients). However, even in primary vegetation, broader-scale pressures led to declines in diversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5866556066779772915", "cites_id": ["5866556066779772915"], "pub_url": "https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/7f512dea-5798-400f-a7cc-f60cefccea2d/PubMedCentral/7f512dea-5798-400f-a7cc-f60cefccea2d.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8zdSD6kxalEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
