These data, called background or pseudo\u2010absence data, are usually drawn at random from the entire region, whereas occurrence collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas. Since the spatial bias generally results in environmental bias, the difference between occurrence collection and background sampling may lead to inaccurate models. To correct the estimation, we propose choosing background data with the same bias as occurrence data. We investigate theoretical and practical implications of this approach. Accurate information about spatial bias is usually lacking, so explicit biased sampling of background sites may not be possible. However, it is likely that an entire target group of species observed by similar methods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 2774, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5547415991324370402", "cites_id": ["5547415991324370402"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/07-2153.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4uU14HNh_EwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 15, "2010": 59, "2011": 96, "2012": 98, "2013": 153, "2014": 190, "2015": 175, "2016": 200, "2017": 230, "2018": 250, "2019": 252, "2020": 254, "2021": 320, "2022": 304, "2023": 151}}
