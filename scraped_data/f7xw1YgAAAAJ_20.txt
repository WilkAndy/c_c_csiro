Nevertheless, changes in climate conditions are useful for predicting shifts in species distributions at global and local scales. Here we use the velocity of climate change, to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches from 1960 to 2009 (ref. ) and from 2006 to 2100, and use the properties of these trajectories to infer changes in species distributions. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors for trajectories, creating source and sink areas for local climatic conditions. Climate source areas indicate where locally novel conditions are not connected to areas where similar climates previously occurred, and are thereby inaccessible to climate migrants tracking isotherms: 16% of global surface area for 1960 to 2009, and 34% of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 547, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5094153584319060854", "cites_id": ["5094153584319060854"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12976", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dtue6LERskYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 23, "2015": 55, "2016": 69, "2017": 67, "2018": 58, "2019": 50, "2020": 66, "2021": 58, "2022": 75, "2023": 23}}
