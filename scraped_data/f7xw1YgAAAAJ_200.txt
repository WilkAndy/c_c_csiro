Ecological Integrity is a high-level goal for biodiversity conservation requiring integration of habitat repair and management of intact ecosystems across whole regions. An ecological system with high integrity implies biological, physical, and human interactions that support adaptation and resilience. Individual features have value in their own right; however, EI is concerned less with parts and more with wholes. Ecological Integrity is a complex concept; yet our ability to quantify, anticipate and influence changes to EI relies on the development of practical and representative indicators. Tools at our disposal include existing conceptual models, site-based information, and regional-scale modelling tools. Here, we suggest some conceptual grounding as a prelude to designing indicators of EI, based on existing and proposed state-wide spatial modelling."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5954215836861312537", "cites_id": ["5954215836861312537"], "pub_url": "https://rune.une.edu.au/web/bitstream/1959.11/22627/2/open/SOURCE01.pdf#page=35", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ga4fwMGfoVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
