For well studied species, a range of modelling techniques are available to extrapolate from known locations, using climate and other environmental data to predict areas of suitable habitat for the species. But these approaches have limitations for broad scale applications such as conservation planning, where we may need to consider all species and areas, including those for which data are sparse."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6276228397038029899", "cites_id": ["6276228397038029899"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kristen-Williams-6/publication/255658809_Nice_weather_for_frogs_-_using_environmental_data_to_model_phylogenetic_turnover/links/53e3613d0cf2187dccf38e93/Nice-weather-for-frogs-using-environmental-data-to-model-phylogenetic-turnover.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S8yrZnmkGVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2}}
