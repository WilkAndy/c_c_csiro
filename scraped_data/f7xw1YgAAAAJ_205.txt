GEO oversees a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) as the mechanism to achieve these goals. Biodiversity is one of nine Societal Benefit Areas that GEO is mandated to address. A Biodiversity Observation Network, or GEO BON, is one of the first systems GEO proposes for the emerging GEOSS. This Concept Document presents the case for GEO BON, describes the overall vision, and suggests a framework for its implementation. Stakeholders reviewed earlier drafts of this document at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany in April 2008, and provided final comments in October 2008.By facilitating and linking efforts of countries, international organizations and individuals, GEO BON will contribute to the efficient and effective collection, management, sharing, and analysis of data on the status and trends of the world\u2019s biodiversity. It will also identify gaps in existing observation systems and promote mechanisms to fill them."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9447502642868715492", "cites_id": ["9447502642868715492"], "pub_url": "https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/5620/3/Parr20_GEO%2520BON%2520Concept%2520Documentn005620RevNov08.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5P_AQplFHIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
