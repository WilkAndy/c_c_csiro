Global coordination and innovative policies and tools at all governance levels are required to reverse ongoing declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services on which humans depend. Many of nature\u2019s contributions to human society are difficult to quantify, including cultural and societal recognition of nature for nature\u2019s sake, and the socio-cultural dependence of humans on nature. These relationships with nature frame the storylines that motivate society to act to conserve nature, thus they should serve as the foundation for the next iteration of global biodiversity strategies and goals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6504419942101771480", "cites_id": ["6504419942101771480"], "pub_url": "https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4884426/mod_resource/content/1/Relat%C3%B3rio%20IPBES.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2GTxtnlXRFoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
