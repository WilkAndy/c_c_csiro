Application of such modelling to planning in the northeast New South Wales (NSW) region of Australia represents one of the most extensive and longest running case studies of this approach anywhere in the world. Since the early 1980s, statistical modelling has been used to extrapolate distributions of over 2300 species of plants and animals, and a wide variety of higher-level communities and assemblages. These modelled distributions have played a pivotal role in a series of major land-use planning processes, culminating in extensive additions to the region's protected area system. This paper provides an overview of the analytical methodology used to model distributions of individual species in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 468, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4780411084028657325", "cites_id": ["4780411084028657325"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021302930424", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rT7en41uV0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 8, "2004": 9, "2005": 17, "2006": 40, "2007": 38, "2008": 23, "2009": 43, "2010": 36, "2011": 28, "2012": 24, "2013": 26, "2014": 36, "2015": 15, "2016": 13, "2017": 19, "2018": 20, "2019": 14, "2020": 15, "2021": 21, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
