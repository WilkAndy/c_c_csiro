There is evidence for both increasing and decreasing plant N availability in different biomes, but the data are fragmentary. How plant N availability responds to climate change, N deposition and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration remains a major uncertainty in the projection of the terrestrial carbon sink. The foliar N stable isotope ratio (\u03b415N) is an indicator of plant N availability but its usefulness to infer long-term global patterns has been limited by data scarcity. Combining ground-based \u03b415N and Landsat spectra, we derived annual global maps of Landsat-based foliar \u03b415N as estimates of plant N availability during 1984-2022. We found significant decreases in plant N availability for 44% and increases in 16% of vegetated Earth\u2019s surface with large spatial heterogeneity. Plant N availability declined in woody-dominated ecosystems but increased in herbaceous-dominated ones. These \u03b415N trends were consistently and negatively correlated with the trends of Normalised-Difference-Vegetation-Index as they varied across ecosystems, suggesting increasing plant cover could have led to decreasing plant N availability. Our results indicate possible future reductions in plant N availability in many terrestrial ecosystems and provide a useful way to monitor those changes globally."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2843834/latest", "cites_per_year": {}}
