Monitoring species compositional diversity across large spatial scales is challenging and time consuming. Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271622003434", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:70g185F_LesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
