Second, we extrapolate the spatial patterns in foliage cover and species richness to predict where different plant functional groups are above or below benchmark as spatially-explicit, continuous characteristics across the landscape."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1125611/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y-b1l9w2lcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
