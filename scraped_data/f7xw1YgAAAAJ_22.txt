Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether\u2014and how\u2014humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 454, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=144970451153732522", "cites_id": ["144970451153732522"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2705-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qkPyc9sJAwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 24, "2021": 150, "2022": 185, "2023": 92}}
