We trained ensembles of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the distribution of these indicators over a broad region covering 11.5 million hectares. Importantly, we show spatially explicit models of uncertainty so that end-users have a tangible and transparent means of assessing models.Our key findings were firstly, widely available site-based floristic records can be used to derive aggregated indicators of the structure and composition of plant growth forms. Secondly, ANNs are a powerful method to predict continuous patterns in complex, non-linear data (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient 0.83 (total native vegetation cover) to 0.42 (forb cover)). Thirdly, maps of the standardised residual error give insight into model performance and provide an assessment of model uncertainty in specific locations.Spatially explicit, continuous representations of vegetation composition and structural complexity can add considerable value to conventional maps of vegetation extent or community type.
