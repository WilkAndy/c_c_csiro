Although recent work has emphasized the importance of links between ecosystem functions and measures of ecological specialization as proxies of biodiversity, few studies have analysed macroecological relationships empirically in diverse environments. We tested whether gross primary productivity (GPP) in the Australian Wet Tropics (WT) was distinctly related to community\u2010level measures of the ecological specialization of component tree species across climate space, after accounting for climate drivers.Wet Tropics, Australia.1976\u20132012.Nine hundred and forty\u2010eight WT tree species.Using all geographically valid herbarium records for WT trees, we quantified the realized climatic niche widths using continental surfaces for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12798", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Drd9I6DhbcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
