Although a few global biodiversity models are available, most biodiversity models lie along a continuum of geography and components of biodiversity. Model-based projections of the future of global biodiversity are critical to support policymakers in the development of informed global conservation targets, but the scientific community lacks a clear strategy for integrating diverse data streams in developing, and evaluating the performance of, such biodiversity models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for ongoing testing and refinement of model-based projections of biodiversity trends and change, by linking a broad variety \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMGC11C0749M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
