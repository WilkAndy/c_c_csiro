These models are usually developed using automated stepwise procedures to select the explanatory variables to include in each model and to fit the functions relating each of these variables to the probability of species occurrence. Available procedures for fitting logistic regression models differ in terms of a number of factors, including the basic modelling technique employed (generalised linear or generalised additive modelling), the strategy used to select explanatory variables and to determine the complexity of fitted functions, and the approach used to correct for multiple testing. This study evaluates the effect that each of these factors has on the predictive accuracy of fitted models, using fauna and flora survey data from north-east New South Wales.
