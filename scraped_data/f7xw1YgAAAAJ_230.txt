These datasets have been published in two \u2018AdaptNRM\u2019modules with explanatory guides and maps (www. adaptnrm. org). The datasets were developed to show change in a national context. Given the ecological distinctiveness of Tasmania and surrounding islands, the State Government of Tasmania and Tasmanian NRMs requested CSIRO to minimally contextualise the measures of biodiversity change. The contextual measures used the same models and climate scenarios, and where calculations between locations were needed, made these over just the extent of Tasmania.This report summarises how these contextualise measures were developed with limited guidance on how to use the data. Further details are provided in the AdaptNRM explanatory guides,\u2018implications for biodiversity\u2019(http://adaptnrm. csiro. au/biodiversity-impacts/) and \u2018helping biodiversity adapt\u2019(http://adaptnrm. csiro. au/biodiversity-options/). This technical report should be read in conjunction with those guides and refers to just a subset of the range of measures originally provided and, specifically, those that can be updated with minimal effort to contextualise change for Tasmania."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6364199603974782553&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WT6ZItItUlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
