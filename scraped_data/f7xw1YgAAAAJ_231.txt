Single sector analyses are likely to simplify key interactions across domains which may limit their ability to identify mechanisms to mitigate risks or harness opportunities. This paper describes an integrated suite of a dozen global and national models for exploring Australia\u2019s future through quantitative scenario analysis, GNOME. 3 (the Global and National Outlooks for Materials, Economy, Environment & Energy).The GNOME. 3 suite builds on the integrated suite used in the first CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) National Outlook (Hatfield-Dodds, Adams, et al.(2015)), expanding both its robustness and depth. Expanded modelling capability in the GNOME. 3 includes: a new computable general equilibrium model (GTAP-ME. 3); a global and local learning (GALLM) model of transport, GALLM-T; improvements to CSIRO\u2019s global electricity model GALLM-E; and a global land use and agricultural model, the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), modified to separately identify Australia (GLOBIOM-Aus). GNOME. 3 also provides improved ability to analyse pathways for Australia\u2019s future energy system through a new Australian energy model, AUS-TIMES. Development of computer scripts to automate interactions across core components of the modelling suite improves the transparency and efficiency of scenario analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://vuir.vu.edu.au/41038/1/brinsmead.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1_RByY4jzgUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
