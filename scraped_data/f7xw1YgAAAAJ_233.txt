In particular, multiple definitions of the problem, including difficulties with defining the reference \u201cideal\u201d state, can cause confusion. Here we tackle this challenge using a novel framework involving the scaling of remotely sensed metrics as a function of abiotic environmental space. We test this method using a coarse-scale continent-wide application assuming that all cells in protected areas are in a pristine state, and can therefore serve as benchmarks for assessing the condition of environmentally similar cells outside protected areas.A model based on time series summary statistics of RS metrics and the expected spatial turnover of these as a function of distance in environmental space produced a continent-wide spatial representation of condition exhibiting reasonable alignment with the known distribution of extant native vegetation versus cleared land, showing that this method has considerable promise if given a better quality training set. Whilst these prototype results show broad agreement with highly degraded land, a critical assessment of their behaviour in partially modified land is essential before the approach can be considered ready for application."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/95916131/download.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
