This raises questions about how to conserve biodiversity and, in particular, how to develop and manage the network of protected areas in the future. Preliminary analysis of the implications of climate change for the NRS suggested that protecting habitat in a diversity of environments remains a robust strategy. However, it also found that the ecological impacts of climate change are likely to vary significantly between regions, and management implications and options may need to be assessed at regional scales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/75118028/download.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
