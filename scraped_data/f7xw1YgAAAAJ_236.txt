These ecosystems also supply an abundance of renewable natural resources that have played a key role in the development of the State\u2019s economy and lifestyle. In Queensland, and around the world, local communities are recognising that their wealth and wellbeing are intrinsically dependent on healthy ecosystems providing an array of services and functions (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). This understanding has developed as awareness of the environmental impacts of widespread intense utilisation of natural resources has grown, and the often insurmountable cost of remediation following the clearing of natural habitats has become apparent.Feedback from many small and large scale land management practices, combined with the effects of industrial pollution, have affected the global climate system with wide-ranging consequences for healthy ecosystems and future sustainability. Baseline monitoring of weather has demonstrated that climates are rapidly changing as the atmosphere warms and that warming has accelerated in recent decades (Steffen 2009). Governments have moved from impact assessments to planning for adaptation so that local communities can be helped to adjust to changed living conditions. These adjustments include different ways of managing landscapes as the environment changes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.csiro.au/climate/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2016/03/12F_CAF-Working-Paper-12F.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4fsqMjdtU2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
