However, there has been relatively little investigation into the form of the relationship between compositional dissimilarity and climatic dissimilarity. Here we apply generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM; Ferrier et al. 2007) as a tool for modeling the expected non-linear relationships between compositional and climatic dissimilarity. We use the CCSM3. 0 transient paleoclimatic simulations from the SynTrace working group (Liu et al. 2009) and a new generation of fossil pollen maps from eastern North America (Blois et al. 2011) to 1) assess the spatial relationships between compositional dissimilarity and climatic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFMPP54A..02W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
