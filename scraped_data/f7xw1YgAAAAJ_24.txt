The paper begins by clarifying the relationship between irreplaceability and other conservation planning concepts such as flexibility, rarity, endemism and complementarity. We explain why direct measurement of irreplaceability is currently intractable for most real-world applications, and hence the need for prediction. A new predictive approach is proposed which overcomes a number of major shortcomings of previous approaches to predicting irreplaceability. The new approach employs the central limit theorem to estimate the expected frequency distribution of the area of a feature protected by all possible combinations of a set of sites. This expected distribution is used to estimate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 375, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6152099161110743296", "cites_id": ["6152099161110743296"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320799001494", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AAn8gJelYFUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 7, "2002": 22, "2003": 22, "2004": 19, "2005": 19, "2006": 25, "2007": 34, "2008": 30, "2009": 28, "2010": 19, "2011": 21, "2012": 15, "2013": 20, "2014": 11, "2015": 15, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
