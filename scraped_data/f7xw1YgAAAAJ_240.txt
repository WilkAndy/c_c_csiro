The novelty of the approach that we describe is that it uses as input standard output from regression based species distribution modelling. This we argue gives additional realism to scenarios produced thus leading to more reliable inference.There are numerous abstract simulations of weed spread using diverse techniques such as cellular automata and continuous space kernels. These approaches have their place in the development of abstract theory but we were concerned that the models be as close to an observed reality as possible. We therefore considered using the predictive model from a species that was in approximate equilibrium with the environment and a spread kernel to produce a model that would be consistent with the species distribution but show realistic spread dynamics. In Section 2 we describe the algorithm. In Section 3 we consider an application of the approach. In Section 4 we discuss other approaches and applications of the technique."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/2221217/ACERA0603.pdf#page=25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dSP0fesaxjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
