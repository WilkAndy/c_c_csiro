This flexibility in network design is very important given the frequent need to adjust a design during negotiation between community or government interest groups or to change an initial design in the face of constraints on the availability of land. We have adapted a geographic information system to serve as an interactive planning tool for conservation. The system can be used to explore the flexibility in alternative networks. The system includes a graphics interface which takes instructions from the user, presents the results of conservation software, and provides information to support decisions on particular areas. The conservation software applies the concept of the irreplaceability of areas. This is a basic measure of conservation importance as well as an indication of the options for achieving a conservation goal. We illustrate the applications of the interactive system with a data-set on a large part of western New South Wales and suggest ways in which the system could be used in a fragmented landscape. The ability of the system to incorporate the views of community groups and government agencies, and to identify negotiable and non-negotiable options, considerably strengthens the case for conserving biodiversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11209749873188513792&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AKhhLB4IkZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
