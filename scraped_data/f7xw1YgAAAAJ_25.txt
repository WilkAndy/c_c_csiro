While modelling distributions of individual species is the best known and most widely used approach to such modelling, there are many situations in which more information can be extracted from available data by supplementing, or replacing, species-level modelling with modelling of communities or assemblages. This paper provides an overview of approaches to community-level modelling employed in a series of major land-use planning processes in the northeast New South Wales region of Australia, and evaluates how well communities and assemblages derived using these techniques function as surrogates in regional conservation planning. We also outline three new directions that may enhance the effectiveness \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 357, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12836928111604663635", "cites_id": ["12836928111604663635"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021374009951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UwVswxruJbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 15, "2005": 17, "2006": 21, "2007": 23, "2008": 15, "2009": 25, "2010": 17, "2011": 31, "2012": 16, "2013": 19, "2014": 15, "2015": 21, "2016": 18, "2017": 23, "2018": 16, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
