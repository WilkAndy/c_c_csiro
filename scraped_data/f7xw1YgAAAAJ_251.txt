It also 11 provides a general introduction to the role of scenarios and models in assessment and decision 12 support, describes the structure of the remaining chapters of the report, and highlights key high-13 level messages for IPBES emerging from this assessment. The chapter is purposely written for a 14 broader, less technical audience than the other seven chapters of the report, each of which 15 examines in greater depth a subset of issues and challenges associated with scenario analysis and 16 modelling of biodiversity and ecosystem services. 17 18For the purposes of this assessment, we define \u201cmodels\u201d as qualitative or quantitative 19 representations of key components of a system and of relationships between these components. 20 Throughout this assessment, and in most IPBES activities, the term\" models\" usually, but not 21 exclusively, refers to quantitative descriptions of relationships: i) between indirect drivers and direct 22 drivers; ii) between direct drivers and nature (biodiversity and ecosystems); and iii) between nature 23 and nature's benefits to people, including ecosystem services. Each of these relationships is 24 discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 25 26"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/downloads/pdf/sod_3c_chapter_1_overview.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DtSY0BIl09IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
