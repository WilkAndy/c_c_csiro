However, its origins are also historical, arising from speciation, extinction and past range dynamics. Here, we test the effects of current environmental conditions vs. spatial separation on plant species turnover in the South-West Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR). Using a new approach we then interpret residual (unexplained) gradients in species turnover. Location 650 inventory plots in remnant native vegetation in the 230,000 km2 wheatbelt of the SWAFR.Methods We fitted generalized dissimilarity models of species turnover across sites as a function of current climate, topography, soils and inter-site distances. We then decomposed the model errors into independent axes of residual variation, representing unexplained species turnover. We mapped the spatial patterns evident on the main residual axes, and interpreted these using ancillary data on the life form and geographical ranges of associated species, the distributions of some major habitat types, and predictions of last glacial maximum (LGM) climate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.au.dk/portal/files/121728135/Underestimated_effects_of_climate_on_plant_species_turnover_in_the_Southwest_Australian_Floristic_Region.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PG6dheGFGKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
