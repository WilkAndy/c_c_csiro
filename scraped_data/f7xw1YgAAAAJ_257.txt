The Convention on Biological Diversity aims to achieve the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of its components with fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from genetic resources. Australia's National Reserve System (NRS) is one of many actions arising from the national strategy to address the conservation of biodiversity.The implementation framework for the NRS (NRM Ministerial Council 2005) has a foundation in systematic conservation planning (Margules and Pressey 2000) which recognises that surrogate information about the spatial patterning of biodiversity is needed in setting priorities and targets, and to monitor efficiency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Petina_Pert/publication/292446557_Potential_gaps_in_the_complementary_representation_of_regional_ecosystems_within_protected_areas_of_the_Wet_Tropics_natural_resource_management_planning_region/links/578c522d08ae7a588eeed4c3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P4QPfb9n5xEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
