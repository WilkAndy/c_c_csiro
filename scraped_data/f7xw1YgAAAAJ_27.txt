One way of determining the offset ratio, or the compensation area needed, is to divide the present conservation value of the development site by the predicted future conservation value of a compensation area of the same size. Matching mean expected utility in this way is deficient because it ignores uncertainty and time lags in the growth of conservation value in compensation areas. Instead, we propose an uncertainty analytic framework for calculating what we call robustly fair offset ratios, which guarantee a high enough probability of the exchange producing at least as much conservation value in the offset areas than is lost from the development site. In particular, we analyze how the fair offset ratio is influenced by uncertainty in the effectiveness of restoration action, correlation between success of different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 295, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12230232102835055557", "cites_id": ["12230232102835055557"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00382.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xesPikyDuqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 11, "2012": 20, "2013": 30, "2014": 23, "2015": 44, "2016": 28, "2017": 19, "2018": 21, "2019": 19, "2020": 11, "2021": 20, "2022": 22, "2023": 5}}
