Effective surrogates will reflect general biogeographical patterns and the evolutionary processes that have given rise to these and their efficiency is likely to be influenced by several factors, including the spatial scale of species turnover and the overall congruence of the biogeographical history. We examine patterns of surrogacy for insects, snails, one family of plants and vertebrates from rainforests of northeast Queensland, an area characterized by high endemicity and an underlying history of climate\u2013induced vicariance. Nearly all taxa provided some level of prediction of the conservation values for others. However, despite an overall correlation of the patterns of species richness and complementarity, the efficiency of surrogacy was highly asymmetric; snails and insects were strong predictors of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18049240584518169543", "cites_id": ["18049240584518169543"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2001.1713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x_PEwa7Ie_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 18, "2005": 18, "2006": 12, "2007": 23, "2008": 20, "2009": 17, "2010": 19, "2011": 22, "2012": 18, "2013": 8, "2014": 24, "2015": 7, "2016": 15, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
