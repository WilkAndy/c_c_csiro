Unfortunately, the amount of data available is limited for many taxa and regions, making it essential to quantify the sensitivity of these algorithms to sample size. This is the first study to address this need by rigorously evaluating a broad suite of algorithms with independent presence\u2013absence data from multiple species and regions. We evaluated predictions from 12 algorithms for 46 species (from six different regions of the world) at three sample sizes (100, 30, and 10 records). We used data from natural history collections to run the models, and evaluated the quality of model predictions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). With decreasing sample size, model accuracy decreased and variability increased across species and between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 2514, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17877445641227672469", "cites_id": ["17877445641227672469"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00482.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lRu7iBdyGfgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 39, "2010": 69, "2011": 117, "2012": 121, "2013": 118, "2014": 163, "2015": 149, "2016": 201, "2017": 223, "2018": 220, "2019": 212, "2020": 228, "2021": 255, "2022": 252, "2023": 112}}
