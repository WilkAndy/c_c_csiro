This paper evaluates the extent to which predictive mapping of habitat suitability might be refined by modelling relative abundance or density of a species instead of presence/absence. We use data collected at field survey sites in north-east New South Wales to develop models predicting the abundance of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species as a function of regional-scale environmental variables. The predictive accuracy of these models is then evaluated using survey data collected at independent evaluation sites. A number of \u2018direct\u2019 abundance modelling techniques were evaluated including generalised linear and generalised additive Poisson regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 264, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4899853526822639124", "cites_id": ["4899853526822639124"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320700001397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FFa1ddLG_0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 11, "2003": 6, "2004": 12, "2005": 15, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 10, "2009": 11, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 17, "2013": 17, "2014": 16, "2015": 15, "2016": 6, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
