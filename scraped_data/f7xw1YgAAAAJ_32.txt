These data are therefore not useable over large geographical areas for consistent reviews of established protected areas or future conservation priorities. In this sense, the constraints of data are similar to those in other parts of the world, including global biodiversity hotspots. We describe here the development of a new classification of landscapes at a scale of 1:250,000 across the whole 802,000 km2 of NSW. The classification is derived mainly from abiotic data and, in conjunction with new data on native vegetation cover, has allowed the first quantitative State-wide review of protected areas and future priorities at a scale approaching that of decisions about land use. We also describe methods for measuring biases in the coverage of reserves in relation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1017582785239271162", "cites_id": ["1017582785239271162"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320700000501", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-ka92yYuHw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 14, "2003": 16, "2004": 20, "2005": 13, "2006": 13, "2007": 10, "2008": 15, "2009": 14, "2010": 12, "2011": 13, "2012": 17, "2013": 9, "2014": 17, "2015": 16, "2016": 12, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
