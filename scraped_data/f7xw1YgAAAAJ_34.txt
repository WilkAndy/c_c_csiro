While the relationships fitted between a species and its environment are relatively transparent for many of these modeling techniques, others are more \u2018black box\u2019 in character, only producing geographic predictions and providing minimal or untraditional summaries of the fitted relationships on which these predictions are based. This in turn prevents robust evaluation of the ecological sensibility of such models, a necessary process if model predictions are to be treated with confidence. Here we propose a new but simple method for visualizing modeled responses that can be implemented with any modeling method, and demonstrate its application using five common methods applied to the prediction of an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 228, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13293474495034288989", "cites_id": ["13293474495034288989"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380004006180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xes7E5_oe7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 11, "2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 17, "2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 27, "2021": 29, "2022": 38, "2023": 27}}
