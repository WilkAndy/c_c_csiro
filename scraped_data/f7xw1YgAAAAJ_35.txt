A classification of 81 environmental units was derived by subdividing the region according to combinations of mean annual rainfall, mean annual temperature, soil fertility and slope. All environmental units contain forest, although some also contain other vegetation formations. The units were used to separate the region's forests into 81 classes. This approach produced a consistent classification of environments for the entire region that could be applied across all land tenures and uses. Derivation of the classification from physical data also enabled the extent of clearing of each environmental unit to be accurately assessed. The coverage of the environmental units by all formal protection measures was measured \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11750483529090611378", "cites_id": ["11750483529090611378"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112796037668", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sjiGUoMaEqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 14, "2000": 11, "2001": 10, "2002": 18, "2003": 19, "2004": 19, "2005": 9, "2006": 9, "2007": 12, "2008": 4, "2009": 11, "2010": 6, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
