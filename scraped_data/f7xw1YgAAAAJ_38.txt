Implicit in this approach are weakly justified assumptions that the rate of species turnover remains constant along gradients and that this rate can therefore serve as a means to compare ecological systems. We use generalized dissimilarity modelling, a novel method that accommodates variation in rates of species turnover along gradients and between different gradients, to compare environmental and spatial controls on the floras of two regions with contrasting evolutionary and climatic histories: southwest Australia and northern Europe. We find stronger signals of climate history in the northern European flora and demonstrate that variation in rates of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9538878095671521838", "cites_id": ["9538878095671521838"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2013.1201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LnJBwBbnYIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 22, "2018": 18, "2019": 33, "2020": 24, "2021": 38, "2022": 21, "2023": 9}}
