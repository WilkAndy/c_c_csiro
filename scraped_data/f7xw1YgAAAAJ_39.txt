Online aggregators of biological and environmental data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Atlas of Living Australia, necessitate a rational approach to variable selection. We outline a set of general principles for systematically identifying, compiling, evaluating and selecting environmental variables for a biodiversity model. Our approach aims to maximise the information obtained from the analysis of biological records linked to a potentially large suite of spatial environmental variables. We demonstrate the utility of this structured framework through case studies with Australian vascular plants: regional modelling of a species distribution, continent-wide modelling of species compositional turnover and environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4159038490476514070", "cites_id": ["4159038490476514070"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2012.698015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FosHuHjftzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 16, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 18, "2018": 14, "2019": 15, "2020": 13, "2021": 25, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
