Although the geographical range limits of species are dynamic and fluctuate over time, climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth. For marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species alike, the first response to changing climate is often a shift in location, to stay within preferred environmental conditions. At the cooler extremes of their distributions, species are moving poleward, whereas range limits are contracting at the warmer range edge, where temperatures are no longer tolerable. On land, species are also moving to cooler, higher elevations; in the ocean, they are moving to colder water at greater depths. Because different species respond at different rates and to varying degrees, key interactions among species are often disrupted, and new interactions develop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 2376, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17030484470156552981", "cites_id": ["17030484470156552981"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aai9214", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fet87GRvWOwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 55, "2018": 220, "2019": 364, "2020": 410, "2021": 559, "2022": 508, "2023": 222}}
