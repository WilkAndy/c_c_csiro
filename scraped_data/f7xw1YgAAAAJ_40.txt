Although the ongoing degradation of ecosystems 5, 6 and the extinction of species that comprise them 7, 8 are now well-documented, little is known about the role that remaining wilderness areas have in mitigating the global biodiversity crisis. Here we model the persistence probability of biodiversity, combining habitat condition with spatial variation in species composition, to show that retaining these remaining wilderness areas is essential for the international conservation agenda. Wilderness areas act as a buffer against species loss, as the extinction risk for species within wilderness communities is\u2014on average\u2014less than half that of species in non-wilderness communities. Although all wilderness areas have an intrinsic conservation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7574935535640503859", "cites_id": ["7574935535640503859"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1567-7%C2%A0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M-ZVZryTH2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 48, "2021": 45, "2022": 56, "2023": 14}}
