Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems, conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology, the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate changing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16054293543919445894", "cites_id": ["16054293543919445894"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12344", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hmcqPetOzN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 14, "2019": 32, "2020": 31, "2021": 37, "2022": 34, "2023": 17}}
