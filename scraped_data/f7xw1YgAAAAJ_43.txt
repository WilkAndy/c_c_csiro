These models have been developed using stepwise statistical procedures but incorporate only limited expert involvement of the type sometimes advocated in distribution modelling. The objectives of this study were twofold. First, to evaluate techniques for incorporating fine\u2010scaled vegetation and growth\u2010stage mapping into models of species distribution. Secondly, to compare methods that incorporate expert opinion directly into statistical models derived using stepwise statistical procedures.  2 Using faunal data from north\u2010east New South Wales, Australia, logistic regression models using fine\u2010scale vegetation and expert opinion were compared with models employing only abiotic and broad vegetation variables.  3 Vegetation and growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 166, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16641076013775673818", "cites_id": ["16641076013775673818"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00608.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2llfYXf68OYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 11, "2005": 10, "2006": 13, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 15, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 12, "2013": 9, "2014": 14, "2015": 8, "2016": 14, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
