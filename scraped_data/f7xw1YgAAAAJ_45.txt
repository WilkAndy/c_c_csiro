However, because most biodiversity is invisible to Earth observation, indicators based on Earth observation could be misleading and reduce the effectiveness of nature conservation and even unintentionally decrease conservation effort. We describe an approach that combines automated recording devices, high-throughput DNA sequencing and modern ecological modelling to extract much more of the information available in Earth observation data. This approach is achievable now, offering efficient and near-real-time monitoring of management impacts on biodiversity and its functions and services."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4212703828197487356", "cites_id": ["4212703828197487356"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_LKj18-HdjoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 9, "2018": 22, "2019": 32, "2020": 48, "2021": 22, "2022": 18, "2023": 13}}
