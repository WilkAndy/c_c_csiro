It is the realisation of the biodiversity societal benefit area envisaged in the GEO System of Systems (GEOSS). GEO BON links together existing networks, each covering particular aspects of biodiversity or parts of the world, and takes steps to help fill important gaps in the system. GEO BON focusses on coordination and harmonisation of the existing and emerging systems; advocacy and action to sustain the observing systems and to fill the identified gaps; and understanding and servicing user needs for biodiversity observations, particularly in the policy-making domain."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3271443350893573100", "cites_id": ["3271443350893573100"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343511001394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7DPTEGWAZi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 21, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 23, "2018": 17, "2019": 16, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
