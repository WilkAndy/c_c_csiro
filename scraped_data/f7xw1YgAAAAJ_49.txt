While emerging technologies increase the breadth and reach of data acquisition, monitoring efforts are still spatially and temporally fragmented, and taxonomically biased. Appropriate long-term information remains therefore limited. The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) aims to provide a general framework for biodiversity monitoring to support decision-makers. Here, we discuss the coordinated observing system adopted by GEO BON, and review challenges and advances in its implementation, focusing on two interconnected core components \u2014 the Essential Biodiversity Variables as a standard framework for biodiversity monitoring, and the Biodiversity Observation Networks that support harmonized observation systems \u2014 while highlighting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7302481587495250195", "cites_id": ["7302481587495250195"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343517301665", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Eyl8SVCgV2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 24, "2020": 25, "2021": 34, "2022": 41, "2023": 19}}
