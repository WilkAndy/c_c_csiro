For these applications, the key property of an area is its \u201ccomplementarity\u201d\u2014the context-dependent, marginal gain in biodiversity provided by the area. Given that there has been little implementation of whole-sets of areas generated by the popular computer-based selection methods, we suggest that analogous \u201cpolicy-based algorithms\u201d would be a more effective real-world application of complementarity. Areas would be \u201cselected\u201d for conservation over time as a consequence of policies in which dynamic complementarity values influence application of economic instruments. These integrated biodiversity/economic strategies can use an extended form of complementarity reflecting marginal changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 135, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10013023740848333397", "cites_id": ["10013023740848333397"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901103000443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VWLRgApo9YoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 10, "2006": 20, "2007": 17, "2008": 14, "2009": 18, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
