Significant challenges in modelling climate change impacts arise from limitations in our current knowledge of biodiversity. Community\u2010level modelling can complement species\u2010level approaches in overcoming these limitations and predicting climate change impacts on biodiversity as a whole. However, the community\u2010level approaches applied to date have been largely correlative, ignoring the key processes that influence change in biodiversity over space and time. Here, we suggest that the development of new \u2018semi\u2010mechanistic\u2019 community\u2010level models would substantially increase our capacity to predict climate change impacts on biodiversity.Location\u2002 Global.Methods\u2002 Drawing on an expansive review of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9384195137142976723", "cites_id": ["9384195137142976723"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00735.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0_Ba9MFbO4IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 11, "2013": 11, "2014": 15, "2015": 12, "2016": 10, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 4, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
