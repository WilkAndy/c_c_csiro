Here, we assess the role of stable Pleistocene climate and Cenozoic topography in explaining variation in regional richness of the globe's MCEs. We hypothesize that older, more climatically stable MCEs would support more species, because they have had more time for species to accumulate than MCEs that were historically subject to greater topographic upheavals and fluctuating climates.South\u2010western Africa (Cape), south\u2010western Australia, California, central Chile and the eastern (Greece) and western (Spain) Mediterranean Basin.We estimated plant diversity for each MCE as the intercepts of species\u2013area curves that are homogeneous in slope across all regions.
