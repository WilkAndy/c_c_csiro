Subsequent chapters of this book explore, in considerable technical depth, the state-of-the-art of such approaches and describe software tools commonly used for their implementation. Here we step back from the details of specific techniques and tools to consider the general nature and role of quantitative prioritization from the perspective of conservation planning, and related disciplines of environmental planning and management. Spatial conservation prioritization is a form of assessment (ie analysis of available information) aimed at informing decision-making for a particular class of environmental planning problem. The problems in this class involve choices about the spatial location of actions that will be applied across a landscape (or seascape\u2013throughout this chapter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17192150615693964652", "cites_id": ["17192150615693964652"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17192150615693964652&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bLVzpeXJlu4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
