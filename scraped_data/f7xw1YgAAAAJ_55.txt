As a first step towards achieving this, the researchers who participated in the scenarios and models expert group of the Intergovernmental Science\u2010Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) entered into an iterative, participatory process that led to the development of the Nature Futures Framework (NFF). The NFF is a heuristic tool that captures diverse, positive relationships of humans with nature in the form of a triangle. It can be used both as a boundary object for continuously opening up more plural perspectives in the creation of desirable nature scenarios and as an actionable framework for developing consistent nature scenarios across multiple scales. Here we describe the methods employed to develop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9834703379379644852", "cites_id": ["9834703379379644852"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pan3.10146", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tOlB953ie4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 29, "2022": 51, "2023": 26}}
