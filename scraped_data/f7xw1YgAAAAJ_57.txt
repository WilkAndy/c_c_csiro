Multi\u2010species models can incorporate data for rare or poorly\u2010sampled species, but their application to forecasting climate change impacts on biodiversity has been limited. Here we compare forecasts of changes in patterns of ant biodiversity in North America derived from ensembles of single\u2010species models to those from a multi\u2010species modeling approach, Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM). We found that both single\u2010 and multi\u2010species models forecasted large changes in ant community composition in relatively warm environments. GDM predicted higher turnover than SDMs and across a larger contiguous area, including the southern third of North America and notably Central \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10551886041405191407", "cites_id": ["10551886041405191407"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.06653.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7_RbyHLUb5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
