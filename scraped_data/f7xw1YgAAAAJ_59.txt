In bioregions that experience drought and fire, micro\u2010refuges can play a vital role in ensuring the persistence of species. We develop and apply an approach to identifying potential micro\u2010refuges based on a time series of remotely sensed vegetation greenness (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the sunlit canopy; fPAR). The primary data for this analysis were NASA MODIS 16\u2010day L3 Global 250 m (MOD13Q1) satellite imagery. This method draws upon relevant ecological theory (source\u2013sink habitats, habitat templet) to calculate a micro\u2010refuge index, which is analyzed for each of the major vegetation ecosystems in the case\u2010study region (the Great Eastern Ranges of New South Wales, Australia). Potential ecosystem greenspots were identified, at a range of thresholds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17915402485000745503", "cites_id": ["17915402485000745503"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/11-1479.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H7Ke5qNLoPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 17, "2016": 17, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
