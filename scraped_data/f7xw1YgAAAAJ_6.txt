However, evidence of SDMs supporting solutions for on\u2010ground conservation problems is still scarce in the scientific literature. Here, we show that successful examples exist but are still largely hidden in the grey literature, and thus less accessible for analysis and learning. Furthermore, the decision framework within which SDMs are used is rarely made explicit. Using case studies from biological invasions, identification of critical habitats, reserve selection and translocation of endangered species, we propose that SDMs may be tailored to suit a range of decision\u2010making contexts when used within a structured and transparent decision\u2010making process. To construct appropriate SDMs to more effectively guide conservation actions, modellers need to better understand the decision process, and decision makers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 1696, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11791492813112048660", "cites_id": ["11791492813112048660"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FHwdUT3Mo6MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 55, "2015": 114, "2016": 126, "2017": 182, "2018": 189, "2019": 183, "2020": 233, "2021": 266, "2022": 224, "2023": 105}}
