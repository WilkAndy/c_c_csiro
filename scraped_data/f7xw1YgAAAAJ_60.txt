Classifications that group rivers and streams with similar ecological characteristics are used increasingly to underpin conservation and resource management planning. Uses include identifying systems that may respond similarly to human activities or management actions, setting guidelines and standards to manage human impacts, interpreting data from inventory (survey) and monitoring, and identifying priority sites for conservation management.2. Traditional approaches to river classification have been based mostly on delineating landscape units (ecoregions), often by grouping adjacent catchments having similar ecological character. However, use of this approach can be complicated by marked local heterogeneity of river systems. Instead, classifications may be more ecologically relevant if individual river or stream segments having similar environmental conditions are grouped together, independent of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2379005914400704215", "cites_id": ["2379005914400704215"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02414.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:10ZoTkbtAyEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 12, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 15, "2018": 13, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
