The first component models the future state (condition) of habitat across a landscape as a function of present state, current and projected pressures acting on this state, and any proposed, or implemented, management interventions. The second component uses this spatially explicit prediction of future habitat state to model the level of persistence expected for each of a set of surrogate biodiversity entities. The third component then integrates these individual expectations to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4443052405161173810", "cites_id": ["4443052405161173810"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00657.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MqMTSJ_kqD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 10, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 6}}
