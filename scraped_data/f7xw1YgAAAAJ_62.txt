However, major expeditions to little-known areas are expensive and time consuming, time is short, and well-trained people are difficult to find. In addition, processing the collections and obtaining accurate identifications takes time and money. In order to get the maximum return for the investment, we need to determine the location of the collecting expeditions carefully. In this study we used environmental variables and information on existing collecting localities to help determine the sites of future expeditions. Results from other studies were used to aid in the selection of the environmental variables, including variables relating to temperature, rainfall, lithology and distance between sites. A survey gap analysis tool based on \u2018ED complementarity\u2019 was employed to select the sites that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=213493617183684983", "cites_id": ["213493617183684983"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/85/4/549/2691646", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d_kLTlB79gIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
