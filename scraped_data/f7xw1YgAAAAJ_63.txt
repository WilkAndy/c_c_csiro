Global biodiversity declined between 2000 and 2010, and there are indications that the decline was greater in freshwater than in terrestrial or marine systems. However, the data, tools and methods available during that decade were inadequate to reliably quantify this decline. Recent advances in freshwater monitoring make a global assessment now close to becoming feasible. Here we identify priorities for freshwater biodiversity assessment for 2020 and 2030, based on the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) framework. We identify 22 priority activities for 2020 under three of the EBV classes (species populations, community composition, and ecosystem structure), which include: a globally systematic approach to collecting and assessing species data, collating existing and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10964995126935389973", "cites_id": ["10964995126935389973"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303640", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FYffEPl8K5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 19, "2021": 21, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
