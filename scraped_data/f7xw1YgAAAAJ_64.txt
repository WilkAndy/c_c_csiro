An effective surrogate strategy would be invaluable for conservation prioritization in such regions. Large\u2010scale environmental data are readily available, but the effectiveness of environmental surrogate strategies for conservation planning has not been confirmed. In this study, we compare a range of such strategies.  2 Environmental surrogacy is based on the idea that by covering a wide range of different environmental conditions, one also achieves high species representation. The effectiveness of this strategy may be enhanced by using community\u2010level modelling techniques, in conjunction with best\u2010available biological (species distribution) data, to calibrate the relationship between environmental gradients and community richness and composition. We develop a novel approach, called \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9403675295558666033", "cites_id": ["9403675295558666033"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01513.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MQfkxtuQgIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 11, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 15, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
