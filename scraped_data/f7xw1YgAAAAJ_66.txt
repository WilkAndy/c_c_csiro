Extensive modelling of the distribution of vascular plant and vertebrate fauna species within north-east New South Wales has been undertaken by linking field survey data to environmental and geographical predictors using logistic regression. These models have been used in the development of a comprehensive and adequate reserve system within the region. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of models for 153 small reptile, arboreal marsupial, diurnal bird and vascular plant species for which independent evaluation data were available. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the relative operating characteristic curve to measure discrimination capacity. Good discrimination ability implies that a model\u2019s predictions provide an acceptable index of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12499800596027330394", "cites_id": ["12499800596027330394"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479701904256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ws9sUWo2eK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 9, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 5, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
