Although a similar methodology has been used successfully to identify Important Bird Areas, we have identified five limitations that may apply when considering other taxa: The KBA approach is overly prescriptive in identifying important conservation features, is inflexible when dealing with landscape connectivity, creates errors by applying global criteria without input from local experts, relies on post hoc consideration of implementation opportunities and constraints, and fails to automatically involve implementation agencies in the assessment process. We suggest three modifications to the present approach: (1) Provide training in regional conservation planning for local stakeholders, (2) expand the Alliance for Zero Extinction program to include a broader range of threatened species, and (3) allow local \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5463973952462362042", "cites_id": ["5463973952462362042"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/57/3/256/268526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:upWBQlzv00sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 15, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
