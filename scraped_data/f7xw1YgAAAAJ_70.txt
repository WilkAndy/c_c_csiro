While this technique has generic application, we demonstrate its application using a biologically-trained environmental classification of New Zealand\u2019s river network. Our analysis produces a priority ranking of planning units (here 4th order catchments or sub-catchments) and performance estimates in terms of expected biodiversity returns given varying degrees of geographic protection. Accounting for community similarity ensures high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3578195617757334194", "cites_id": ["3578195617757334194"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sgpJzfRNqDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 13, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 13, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 3}}
