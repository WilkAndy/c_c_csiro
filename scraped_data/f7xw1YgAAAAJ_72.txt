Within the prevailing societal limitations the process is not easily reversed. Attempts are being made to minimise the fragmentation of remaining habitat by strategically reversing or managing habitat loss. Although their relative usefulness is a topic of debate among ecologists, habitat corridors are seen as one way of maintaining spatially dependent ecological processes within landscapes where habitat has been seriously depleted. Corridors can only be effective if they significantly contribute to the species sustaining processes of gene flow, resource access or the colonisation of vacant patches. We present a spatial habitat modelling methodology for evaluating the contribution and potential contribution of connecting paths to landscape connectivity. We have developed the spatial links tool (SLT), which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8694833659230984004", "cites_id": ["8694833659230984004"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438000600384X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RJeSVyVBqngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 10, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
