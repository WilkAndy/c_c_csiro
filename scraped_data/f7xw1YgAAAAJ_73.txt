However, the ability of markets to motivate the supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services from agricultural land is uncertain, especially given the future changes in environmental, economic, and social drivers. We quantified the potential supply of these services from the intensive agricultural land of Australia from 2013 to 2050 under four global outlooks in response to a carbon price and biodiversity payment scheme. Each global outlook specified emissions pathways, climate, food demand, energy price, and carbon price modeled using the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM). Using a simplified version of the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, economic returns to agriculture, carbon plantings, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7883042322416832974", "cites_id": ["7883042322416832974"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zpEG4TkxZm0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 14, "2016": 11, "2017": 15, "2018": 5, "2019": 14, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
