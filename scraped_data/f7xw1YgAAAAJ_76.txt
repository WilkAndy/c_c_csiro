In the face of such a global driver of species loss, we urgently need to identify refugia that will shelter species from the worst impacts of climate change. This will be a critical component of successful conservation and management of our biodiversity. Despite this, little is known about how best to identify refugia in the landscape, and the practical strategies needed to identify, protect and expand refugia are just beginning to be developed. Identifying refugia that will protect most species, or large numbers of species, remains a complex and daunting endeavour due to the large variations in climatic and biotic requirements of species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10917282284541300904", "cites_id": ["10917282284541300904"], "pub_url": "https://apo.org.au/node/34334", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qNC_QmX6gZcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 14, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
