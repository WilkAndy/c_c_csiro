We tested the effect of climate on spatial patterns of plant community composition over the past 21 000 yr, focusing on whether the spatial relationships between environmental distance and compositional dissimilarity are stable over time. We used a network of fossil\u2010pollen sites in eastern North America, combined with paleoclimate simulations from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 calibrated years before present, 21 kyr BP) to the present. We modeled relationships between climate, geography, and compositional dissimilarity at 1 kyr periods using generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM) and determined the strongest predictors of compositional dissimilarity. We assessed the performance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9506523965725212707", "cites_id": ["9506523965725212707"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07852.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IwDK2S317YMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
