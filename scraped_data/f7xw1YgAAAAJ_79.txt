Here, we apply concepts and measures from systematic conservation planning and financial accounting to provide a basis for determining equity across type (of biodiversity), space, and time. We introduce net present biodiversity value (NPBV) as a theoretical and practical measure for defining the offset required to achieve no-net-loss. For evaluating equity in type and space we use measures of biodiversity value from systematic conservation planning. Time discount rates are used to address risk of non-repayment, and loss of utility. We illustrate these concepts and measures with two examples of biodiversity impact\u2013offset transactions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11968940191167971119", "cites_id": ["11968940191167971119"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-012-0342-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L392kLA3GqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 12, "2015": 14, "2016": 15, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
