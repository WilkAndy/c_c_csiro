In an example analysis of species and environmental data from Panama, the environmental and spatial variables that correlate with an hybrid multi\u2010dimensional scaling ordination were able to explain 83% of the variation in the corresponding Bray Curtis dissimilarities. The assumptions of ED also provide the rationale for its use of p\u2010median optimization criteria to measure biodiversity patterns among sites in a region. M.B. Ara\u00fajo, P.J. Densham & P.H.
