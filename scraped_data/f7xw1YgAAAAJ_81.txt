The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e., nature's contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) \u2013 SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP3xRCP6.0, SSP5xRCP8.6 \u2013 to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenario selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem services models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modeling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modeling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5037761978177988256", "cites_id": ["5037761978177988256"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/4537/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oKZE9NO56UUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 14, "2020": 24, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
