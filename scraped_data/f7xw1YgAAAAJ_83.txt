To harness this information for broad\u2010scale spatial analysis, we present phylo\u2010GDM, a technique for interpolating the spatial structure of phylogenetic turnover between sampled locations in relation to environment, based on generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM).Using a database of over 150 000 location records for 114 myobatrachid frog species in Australia, linked to a species\u2010level phylogeny inferred from 2467 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA, we calculated species and phylogenetic turnover between pairs of sites. We show how phylogenetic turnover extended the range of informative comparison of compositional turnover to more biologically and environmentally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8863565401534282784", "cites_id": ["8863565401534282784"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00466.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ILzkgcW1AXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
