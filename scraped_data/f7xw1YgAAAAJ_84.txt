Anticipating future impacts is essential to inform policy decisions for achieving these targets, but predictions need to be of sufficiently high spatial resolution to forecast the local effects of global change. As part of the intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models of the Intergovernmental Science\u2010Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, we present a fine\u2010resolution assessment of trends in the persistence of global plant biodiversity. We coupled generalized dissimilarity models, fitted to >52 million records of >254 thousand plant species, with the species\u2013area relationship, to estimate the effect of land\u2010use and climate change on global biodiversity persistence. We estimated that the number of plant species committed to extinction over the long term has increased by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3712512727871893418", "cites_id": ["3712512727871893418"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qq_rAKh-hTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 15, "2021": 20, "2022": 20, "2023": 11}}
