While recent modelling has focussed largely on individual species, macroecology has the potential to add significant value to these efforts, by incorporating important community\u2010level constraints and processes. Here we show how a new dynamic macroecological approach can project climate\u2010change impacts collectively across all species in a diverse taxonomic group, overcoming shortfalls in our knowledge of biodiversity, while incorporating the key processes of dispersal and community assembly. Our approach applies a recently published technique (DynamicFOAM) to predict the present composition of every community, which form the initial conditions for a new metacommunity model (M\u2010SET) that projects changes in composition over time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9483128259979716455", "cites_id": ["9483128259979716455"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02760.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZyePn-jWmoMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 6}}
