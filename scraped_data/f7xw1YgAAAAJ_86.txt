However, for models to be come more useful spatial pattern needs to be integrated with dynamic ecological processes. Existing modelling techniques often struggle to integrate faunal movement abilities or are impractical for routine application. We present here the cost\u2013benefit approach (CBA), a modelling approach that integrates the costs of movement to organisms with the benefits of access to habitat. The approach brings together landscape ecology's interest in realistically complex landscapes with fundamental theory from metapopulation ecology. CBA employs continuously variable spatial surfaces representing habitat quality and habitat permeability that reflect species\u2019 habitat preferences and movement abilities respectively. Inter-site distance measurement is derived using the accumulated permeability along least cost paths.
