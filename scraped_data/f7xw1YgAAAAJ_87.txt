The level of dissimilarity in species composition between these sites is analysed in relation to inter-site differences in a number of remotely mapped environmental and vegetational variables and inter-site geographical separation. Results of this analysis are compared with those obtained from analyses of spatial turnover in species composition of vertebrates and vascular plants. Biological dissimilarity between sites is correlated with intersite environmental differences for ail surveyed arthropod, vertebrate and plant groups. However, after controlling statistically for environmental differences, the correlation between biological dissimilarity and inter-site geographical separation is much stronger for ground-dwelling arthropods than for vertebrates and vascular plants. These results have important implications for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3044080983733666881", "cites_id": ["3044080983733666881"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/australian-zoologist/book/chapter-pdf/2643105/rzsnsw_1999_013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QYT3xoa_PioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 12, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
