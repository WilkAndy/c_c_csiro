The effects of land use on biodiversity manifest primarily at local scales which are not captured by the coarse spatial grain of current global land\u2010use mapping. Assessments of land\u2010use impacts on biodiversity across large spatial extents require data at a similar spatial grain to the ecological processes they are assessing. Here, we develop a method for statistically downscaling mapped land\u2010use data that combines generalized additive modeling and constrained optimization. This method was applied to the 0.5\u00b0 Land\u2010use Harmonization data for the year 2005 to produce global 30\u2033 (approx. 1 km2) estimates of five land\u2010use classes: primary habitat, secondary habitat, cropland, pasture, and urban. The original dataset was partitioned into 61 bio\u2010realms (unique combinations of biome and biogeographical realm) and downscaled using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1378489952580666740", "cites_id": ["1378489952580666740"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dAUE7k5hIRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
