However, species often have physiological limits beyond the range of environmental conditions experienced in their present realized niche, and these limits may also be extended further through evolution in response to the selection pressure provided by climate change. Our aim was to develop a general framework for incorporating key parameters relating to physiological limits and adaptive evolution into models of the impact of climate change.Global.Four types of parameter are defined in our framework: the realized limit, the current physiological limit, the evolutionary physiological limit and the rate of adaptive evolution. These parameters can be estimated or predicted using a variety of information sources \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5801179789222922180", "cites_id": ["5801179789222922180"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12344", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xMfORkjugVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 18, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
