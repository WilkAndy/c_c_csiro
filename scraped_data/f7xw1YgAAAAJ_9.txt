The approach is an extension of matrix regression, designed specifically to accommodate two types of nonlinearity commonly encountered in large\u2010scaled ecological data sets: (1) the curvilinear relationship between increasing ecological distance, and observed compositional dissimilarity, between sites; and (2) the variation in the rate of compositional turnover at different positions along environmental gradients. GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 930, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11826159777533222341", "cites_id": ["11826159777533222341"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00341.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xV3h9Kj1HqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 20, "2009": 25, "2010": 37, "2011": 41, "2012": 39, "2013": 45, "2014": 42, "2015": 48, "2016": 57, "2017": 70, "2018": 65, "2019": 89, "2020": 91, "2021": 114, "2022": 89, "2023": 43}}
