Modelling community\u2010level attributes (\u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity) over space can help overcome this shortfall in our knowledge, yet individually, predictions of \u03b1\u2010 or \u03b2\u2010diversity have their limitations. In this study, we present a novel approach to combining models of \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity, with sparse survey data, to predict the community composition for all sites in a region. We applied our new approach to predict land snail community composition across New Zealand. As we demonstrate, these predictions of metacommunity composition have diverse potential applications, including predicting \u03b3\u2010diversity for any set of sites, identifying target areas for conservation reserves, locating priority areas for future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14518936971580832096", "cites_id": ["14518936971580832096"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01675.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YHlcQ0CgfckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
