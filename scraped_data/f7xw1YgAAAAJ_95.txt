Two common types of spatiotemporally explicit ecological models are those focussed on biodiversity composition and those focussed on ecosystem function. These modelling disciplines are largely practiced separately, with separate literature, despite growing evidence that natural systems are shaped by the interaction of composition and function. Here we call for the development of new modelling approaches that integrate composition and function, accounting for the important interactions between these two dimensions, particularly under rapid global change. We examine existing modelling approaches that have begun to combine elements of composition and function, identifying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12615971284325595733", "cites_id": ["12615971284325595733"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.02792", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VXrBcgrvFK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 14, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
