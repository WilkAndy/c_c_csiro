Planning for the conservation of river biodiversity must involve a wide range of management options and account for the complication that the effects of many actions are spatially removed from these actions. Reserve design algorithms widely used in conservation planning today are not well equipped to address such complexities.2. We used process\u2010based models to estimate the expected persistence of river biodiversity under alternative catchment\u2010wide management scenarios and applied it in the Hunter Region (37\u2003000\u2003km\u00b2) in southeastern Australia.3. The biological condition of 12\u2003197 subcatchments was estimated using a multiple linear regression model that related assessments of the integrity of macroinvertebrate assemblages to human\u2010induced disturbances at river sites. The best\u2010fit model (R2\u2003=\u20030.76) used measures of both local and catchment\u2010wide disturbances as well as elevation and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7326133414706790674", "cites_id": ["7326133414706790674"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02394.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EsG3cIanq2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 18, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
