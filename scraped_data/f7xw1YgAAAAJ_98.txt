Different aspects of bee community diversity vary in their sensitivity to these pressures, as well as independently influencing ecosystem service provision (pollination). To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of human impacts on bee diversity across Europe, we assess multiple, complementary indices of diversity.One Thousand four hundred and forty six sites across Europe.We collated data on bee occurrence and abundance from the published literature and supplemented them with the PREDICTS database. Using Rao's Quadratic Entropy, we assessed how species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of 1,446 bee communities respond to land\u2010use characteristics including land\u2010use class, cropland intensity, human population density and distance to roads. We combined these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12274230686331019393", "cites_id": ["12274230686331019393"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12638", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gaD1DcfTVqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
