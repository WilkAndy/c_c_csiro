The primary aim of this study has been to provide a scientific basis for future assessment of status by answering questions concerning three aspects of the species' biology: detectability, habitat requirements, and geographical variation. A secondary aim of the study has been to provide a preliminary assessment of status based on the results of an exploratory survey, interpreted within the context of the intensive research findings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "f7xw1YgAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15907382281114677800", "cites_id": ["15907382281114677800"], "pub_url": "https://rune.une.edu.au/web/handle/1959.11/21366", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KPIuXOdfwtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
