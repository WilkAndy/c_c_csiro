Malware is the primary choice of weapon to carry out malicious intents in the cyberspace, either by exploitation into existing vulnerabilities or utilization of unique characteristics of emerging technologies. The development of more innovative and effective malware defense mechanisms has been regarded as an urgent requirement in the cybersecurity community. To assist in achieving this goal, we first present an overview of the most exploited vulnerabilities in existing hardware, software, and network layers. This is followed by critiques of existing state-of-the-art mitigation techniques as why they do or don't work. We then discuss new attack patterns in emerging technologies such as social media, cloud computing, smartphone technology, and critical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 858, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14635073662639185120", "cites_id": ["14635073662639185120"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000014000178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4JxIy_Q5GssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 11, "2015": 23, "2016": 31, "2017": 35, "2018": 48, "2019": 87, "2020": 117, "2021": 195, "2022": 225, "2023": 70}}
