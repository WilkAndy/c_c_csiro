Along the processing of such applications, a large volume of intermediate data sets will be generated, and often stored to save the cost of recomputing them. However, preserving the privacy of intermediate data sets becomes a challenging problem because adversaries may recover privacy-sensitive information by analyzing multiple intermediate data sets. Encrypting ALL data sets in cloud is widely adopted in existing approaches to address this challenge. But we argue that encrypting all intermediate data sets are neither efficient nor cost-effective because it is very time consuming and costly for data-intensive applications to en/decrypt data sets frequently while performing any operation on them. In this paper, we propose a novel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11846056604317116569", "cites_id": ["11846056604317116569"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6263245/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:meh98belZaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 13, "2014": 34, "2015": 30, "2016": 38, "2017": 24, "2018": 18, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
