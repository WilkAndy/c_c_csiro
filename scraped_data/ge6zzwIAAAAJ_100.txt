Facing a huge number of services with similar functionalities, how to identify the core services in different domains and recommend the trustworthy ones for developers is an important issue for the promotion of the service ecosystem. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous network model, and then a unified reputation propagation (URP) framework is introduced to calculate the global reputation of entities in the ecosystem. Furthermore, the topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to cluster the services into specific domains. Combining URP with the topic model, we re-rank services\u2019 reputations to distinguish the core services so as to recommend trustworthy domain-aware services \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9357000780957495603", "cites_id": ["9357000780957495603"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45005-1_24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MzEGgKK-2oEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
