It is thus important to identify how specific mechanisms can help build engagement. In this work, we investigate how rewarding members for their honesty can offer better engagement and raise the level of cooperativeness in the society.

Our results show that providing right reward for honest actions promotes engagement and cooperation in the society."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4626854846032689894", "cites_id": ["4626854846032689894"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6296146/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5roS5ffjNUAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
