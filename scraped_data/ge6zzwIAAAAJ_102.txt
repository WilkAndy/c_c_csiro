Traditional malware detection and family classification technologies are becoming less effective due to the rapid evolution of the malware landscape, with the emerging of so-called zero-day-family malware families. To address this issue, our paper presents a novel research problem on automatically identifying the security/privacy-related capabilities of any detected malware, which we refer to as  Malware Capability Annotation  (MCA). Motivated by the observation that known and zero-day-family malware families share the security/privacy-related capabilities, MCA opens a new alternative way to effectively analyze zero-day-family malware (the malware that do not belong to any existing families) through exploring the related information and knowledge from known malware families. To address the MCA problem, we design a new MCA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15457552832843721807", "cites_id": ["15457552832843721807"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8863494/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T6x7YmdChNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 14, "2023": 1}}
