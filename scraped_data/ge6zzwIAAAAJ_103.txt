As these edge devices are in proximity to users, this results in improved application response times and reduces load on the cloud data center (cdc). In this paper, we propose a security and deadline aware scheduling algorithm called RT-SANE (Real-Time Security Aware scheduling on the Network Edge). Applications with stringent privacy requirements are scheduled on an mdc closer to the user, whereas others can be scheduled on a cdc or a remote mdc. We also discuss how application performance and network latency influence the choice of an mdc or cdc. The intuition is that due to a lower communication latency between the user & the mdc, more applications are able to meet their deadlines when run on the mdc. Conversely, applications with loose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11421416758212476762", "cites_id": ["11421416758212476762"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3147213.3147216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Wr_yQAcGgZ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
