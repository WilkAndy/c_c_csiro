To reduce storage and bandwidth requirements, they are commonly stored in a compressed format, such as MPEG-1. Increasing amounts of MPEG encoded audio and video documents are available online and in proprietary collections. In order to effectively utilise them, we need tools and techniques to automatically analyse, segment, and classify MPEG video content. Several techniques have been developed both in the audio and visual domain to analyse videos. This paper presents a survey of audio and visual analysis techniques on MPEG-1 encoded media that are useful in supporting a variety of video applications. Although audio and visual feature analyses have been carried out extensively, they become useful to applications only when they convey a semantic meaning of the video content. Therefore, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12658002095212586370", "cites_id": ["12658002095212586370"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-005-2716-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:guVLM9dBqq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
