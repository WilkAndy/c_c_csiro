For a real-world use case (e.g., an Apache Server), many kernel services are unused and only a small amount of kernel code is used. Within the used code, a certain part is invoked only at runtime while the rest are executed at startup and/or shutdown phases in the kernel\u2019s lifetime run. In this paper, we propose a reliable and practical system, named KASR, which transparently reduces attack surfaces of commodity OS kernels at runtime without requiring their source code. The KASR system, residing in a trusted hypervisor, achieves the attack surface reduction through a two-step approach: (1) reliably depriving unused code of executable permissions, and (2) transparently segmenting used code and selectively activating them. We implement a prototype of KASR on Xen-4.8.2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8797790708184400233", "cites_id": ["8797790708184400233"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00470-5_32", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aUGQUQkIGHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
