Data analytics activities raise a new set of technical challenges from the perspective of ensuring end-to-end security and privacy of data as it travels from an edge datacenter (EDC) to a cloud datacenter (CDC) (or vice versa). This article discusses the security threats in EDCs and CDCs by dividing the complete network structure into three layers: perception layer, network layer, and application layer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3567002969717108325", "cites_id": ["3567002969717108325"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7503493/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZW7AWk2KgDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 24, "2018": 32, "2019": 27, "2020": 31, "2021": 31, "2022": 32, "2023": 4}}
