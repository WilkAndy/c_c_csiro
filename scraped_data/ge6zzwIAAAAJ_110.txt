This data can be analysed to identify precise trajectories of individuals \u2014 where they went and when they were there. This is an obvious privacy issue, yet publication of real-time aggregate over such location streams can provide valuable resources for researchers and government agencies, e.g., in case of pandemics it would be very useful to identify who might have come into contact with an infected individual at a given time. Differential privacy techniques have become popular and widely adopted to address privacy concerns. However, there are three key issues that limit the application of existing differential privacy approaches to user trajectory data: (a) the heterogeneous nature of the trajectories, (b) uniform sliding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11109463371515591530", "cites_id": ["11109463371515591530"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17300596", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:antmcBO-LJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
