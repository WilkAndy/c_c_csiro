These devices are resource-constrained and are vulnerable to attack. As the IoMTs are connected to the healthcare network infrastructure, it becomes the primary target of the adversary due to weak security and privacy measures. In this regard, this paper proposes a security architecture for smart healthcare network infrastructures. The architecture uses various security components or services that are developed and deployed as virtual network functions. This makes the security architecture ready for future network frameworks such as OpenMANO. Besides, in this security architecture, only authenticated and trusted IoMTs serve the patients along with an encryption-based communication protocol, thus creating a secure, privacy-preserving and trusted healthcare network infrastructure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:-DxkuPiZhfEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10734246400767254442", "cites_id": ["10734246400767254442"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9165387/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ql8_oTq095QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
