The scheme allows any user to generate a search query by interacting with any \u03b8 is a threshold parameter) `helping' users. It preserves the privacy of a database content against the server assuming a leakage of up to \u03b8-1 users' keys to the server while hiding the query from the \u03b8-1 `helping users'. To achieve the query privacy, we design a new distributed key-homomorphic pseudorandom function (PRF) that hides the PRF input (search keyword) from the `helping' users. We present a concrete construction of our randomizable distributed PRF. By distributing the utilized keys among the users, the need for a constant online presence of the data owner to provide services to the users is eliminated, while providing resilience against a user key exposure. We extended our scheme to support user revocation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1921585841102656733", "cites_id": ["1921585841102656733"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8889657/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3RRYOCTYqhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 12, "2023": 9}}
