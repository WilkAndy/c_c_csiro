A typical example of this application is online dating. Most recently, an online dating website, Ashley Madison, was hacked, which resulted in a disclosure of a large number of dating user profiles. This data breach has urged researchers to explore practical privacy protection for user profiles in a social network. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for profile matching in social networks by using multiple servers. Our solution is built on homomorphic encryption and allows a user to find out matching users with the help of multiple servers without revealing to anyone the query and the queried user profiles in clear. Our solution achieves user profile privacy and user query privacy as long as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6884175512292915762", "cites_id": ["6884175512292915762"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8695745/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MnqpjSeBiV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 1}}
