Despite much work being done in the field of cyber security, most of the focus seems to be concentrated on system usage. In this paper, we survey advancements made in the development and design of the human centric cyber security domain. We explore the increasing complexity of cyber security with a wider perspective, defining user, usage and usability (3U\u2019s) as three essential components for cyber security consideration, and classify developmental efforts through existing research works based on the human centric security design, implementation and deployment of these components. Particularly, the focus is on studies that specifically illustrate the shift in paradigm from functional and usage centred cyber security, to user centred cyber security by considering the human aspects of users. The aim of this survey is to provide both users and system designers with insights into the workings and applications of human centric cyber security."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5575240931477768539", "cites_id": ["5575240931477768539"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2021.583723/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W0nzmRY8X00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
