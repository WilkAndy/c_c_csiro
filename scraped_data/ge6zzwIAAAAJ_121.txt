This leads to sharing resources among various public and private clouds in order to improve the performance while executing the organization's complex workflow systems. Executing multiple workflows in such a hybrid environment needs an effective mapping between workflow's tasks and cloud resources that considers the trade-off between budget and time. There is also a challenge when organizations are forced to deploy workflow's tasks on public resources to execute the tasks before their requested deadlines without violating customers' privacy. In recent years, several online and static approaches were presented to schedule single or multiple workflows considering deadline and budget in cloud environments. However, these studies neglect the privacy constraint along with other SLAs such as deadline and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4358670660938753395", "cites_id": ["4358670660938753395"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7037702/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c-Urdt8bfTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
