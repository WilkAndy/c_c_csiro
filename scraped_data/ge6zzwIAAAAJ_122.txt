This limits the portability and mobility of trust as demanded by many emerging applications that go beyond the organizational boundaries. In order to address this problem, we propose a mobile and portable trusted computing platform in a form of a USB device. First, we describe the design and implementation of the hardware and software architectures of the device. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed device by developing a trusted application."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7092758239214068792", "cites_id": ["7092758239214068792"], "pub_url": "https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-1499-2011-75", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OGQUHgqKbmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
