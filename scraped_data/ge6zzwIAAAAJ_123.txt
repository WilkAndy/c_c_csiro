The aim of the adaptation process is to maximize users' viewing experiences of video quality and minimize resources required to deliver the content. Towards this, we have developed a quality driven adaptation algorithm and implemented a prototype system called DAVE. DAVE minimizes resource requirements by identifying relevant segments within a video and then scales the identified video segment in different dimensions so that it can be delivered within the available network bandwidth, and played back by the client device. Simultaneously, it maximizes the video quality by identifying and tuning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6588030777675652205", "cites_id": ["6588030777675652205"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/973264.973299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bZyyYBZjbVsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 14, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
