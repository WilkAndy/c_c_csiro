The proposed model is based on the Boltzmann behaviour model and considers the behaviour of consumers under the social influence. We evaluate the proposed model and discuss the corresponding results. We also include a comparison with feedback-based models in the presence of high impact events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=633833252409107427", "cites_id": ["633833252409107427"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5707183/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4-OsIPzTywgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
