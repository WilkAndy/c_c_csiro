We test DRAMDig on a number of machines with different combinations of DRAM chips and microarchitectures ranging from Intel Sandy Bridge to Coffee Lake. Comparing to previous works, DRAMDig deterministically reverse-engineered DRAM address mappings on all the test machines with only 7.8 minutes on average. Based on the uncovered mappings, we perform double-sided rowhammer tests and the results show that DRAMDig induced significantly more bit flips than previous works, justifying the correctness of the uncovered DRAM address mappings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1886752358436927994", "cites_id": ["1886752358436927994"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9218599/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-nnDB0YXLxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
