Beyond search, data addition and deletion are also supported in dynamic SSE schemes. Unfortunately, these update operations leak some information of updated data. To address this issue, forward-secure SSE is actively explored to protect the relations of newly updated data and previously searched keywords. On the contrary, little work has been done in backward security, which enforces that search should not reveal information of deleted data. In this paper, we propose the first practical and non-interactive backward-secure SSE scheme. In particular, we introduce a new form of symmetric encryption, named symmetric puncturable encryption (SPE), and construct a generic primitive from simple cryptographic tools. Based on this primitive, we then present a backward-secure SSE \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6589881318920396889", "cites_id": ["6589881318920396889"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3243734.3243782", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WaA7FiX2c1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 28, "2020": 37, "2021": 44, "2022": 43, "2023": 21}}
