To enhance the security of the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) in such circumstance, Android app developers often implement a complementary One-Time Password (OTP) authentication by utilizing the short message service (SMS). Unfortunately, SMS is not specially designed as a secure service and thus an SMS One-Time Password is vulnerable to many attacks. To check whether a wide variety of currently used SMS OTP authentication protocols in Android apps are properly implemented, this paper presents an empirical study against them. We first derive a set of rules from RFC documents as the guide to implement secure SMS OTP authentication protocol. Then we implement an automated analysis system, AUTH-EYE, to check whether a real-world OTP authentication scheme violates any of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16926560339180105445", "cites_id": ["16926560339180105445"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3359789.3359828", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5a4LnvI45-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
