This trusted environment must be established between all participating users and service provider entities before any transactions are carried out. To meet the challenge of enabling mobile users to work within a trusted environment on any untrusted machine, the notion of a trusted personal device (TPD) has emerged. This paper provides a survey giving a snapshot of the growing body of work ongoing in the area of TPDs and the services they support."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15834360875123162105", "cites_id": ["15834360875123162105"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00779-009-0235-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-TsPZ1LzvtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
