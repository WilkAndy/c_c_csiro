Though this specification is suitable for many business-to-business collaborations involving two parties, it does not fulfil the requirement of a new business model involving multiple parties, where a party provides multiple services to other parties and consumes services provided by other parties. To address this requirement, this paper proposes an extension to the WSLA language to capture multi-party collaborations, called WSLA+."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=281104463542769280", "cites_id": ["281104463542769280"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4578560/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gFY-LgWv5gMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
