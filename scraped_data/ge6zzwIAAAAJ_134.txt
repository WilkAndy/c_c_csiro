While there are a considerable number of performance testing products and open source tools available, they are either too expensive and complicated for small projects, or too specific and simple for diverse performance tests. This paper presents a general-purpose testing framework for both simple and small, and complicated and large-scale performance testing. Our framework proposes an abstraction to facilitate performance testing by separating the application logic from the common performance testing functionalities. This leads to a set of general-purpose data models and components, which form the core of the framework. The framework has been prototyped on both .NET and Java platforms and was used for a number of performance-related projects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16771711713838641474", "cites_id": ["16771711713838641474"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4483205/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QjGcgvEWwegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 5}}
