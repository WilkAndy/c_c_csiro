Our technique, called \"Promises\", provides an uniform view for clients which covers a wide range of implementation techniques on the service side, all allowing the client to check a condition and then later rely on that condition still holding."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6516316654368091947", "cites_id": ["6516316654368091947"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0612113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K2-S43ibbloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
