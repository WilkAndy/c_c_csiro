However, the big volume of candidate web services places a heavy burden on the users' service selection decision-making process. Under the circumstance, a variety of intelligent recommendation solutions have been developed to reduce the high decision-making cost. Traditional resolutions usually challenge in two aspects. First, the recommendation parameters, i.e., the quality of services (QoS), usually relies on user/service location heavily; therefore, low-quality recommended results may be returned to users if user/service location information is overlooked. Second, historical QoS data often contain partial sensitive information of users \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13115779437593358413", "cites_id": ["13115779437593358413"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8982047/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TfAfeuibBLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
