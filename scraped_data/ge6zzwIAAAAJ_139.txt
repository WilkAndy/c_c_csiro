These proposals have given little or no consideration to the vulnerabilities between client applications and their users, resulting in identity thefts or impersonator. To address this problem, we propose a biometric enabled portable Trusted Computing Platform (portable TCP). The proposed platform coordinates two stage authentication and subsequent integrity check to provide trusted pathways amongst users, applications, and enterprise servers. We describe the proposed solution and its implementation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1268775849612041717", "cites_id": ["1268775849612041717"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6120849/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9V24t-mYmxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 6}}
