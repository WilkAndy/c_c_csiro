With the emergence of \"cloud computing\", it is now possible to share such resources as services. However, sharing such resource services requires that the participants agree to the terms and conditions of their responsibilities, as well as access to information and policies regulating their behaviour within the collaboration. This is done through the use of an eContract that captures the contributed resource-oriented services, as well as their respective service level agreements. One of the unique characteristics of the contract in dynamic collaborations is that each autonomous participant must agree with the services contributed by other participants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11111006348444389142", "cites_id": ["11111006348444389142"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4578535/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fk8jwGc5MpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
