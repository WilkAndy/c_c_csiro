The use of digital certificates bound to a particular machine works well under the assumption that the underlying computing and networking infrastructure is managed by a single enterprise. Furthermore, managed infrastructures are assumed to have a controlled operational environment, including execution of a standard set of applications and operating system. These assumptions are also valid for recent proposals on establishing trust using hardware-supported systems based on a Trusted Computing Module (TPM) cryptographic microcontroller. However, these assumptions do not hold in today\u2019s cooperative information systems. Clients are mobile and work using network connections that go beyond the administrative boundaries of the enterprise.
