(2005) is about building large-scale distributed applications by composing coarse-grained autonomous services in a flexible architecture that can adapt to changing business requirements. These services interact by exchanging one-way messages through standardized message processing and transport protocols. This vision is being driven by economic imperatives for integration and automation across administrative and organizational boundaries. This paper presents a concise yet expressive model for service contracts to describe messaging behavior. The idea is simple: we use Boolean conditions to specify when a message can be sent and received, where the conditions refer only to other messages in the service contract - that is, conditions only refer to a service's externalized messaging state and not to internal state"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6029150888886521283", "cites_id": ["6029150888886521283"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4032116/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w81PJcrYq1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
