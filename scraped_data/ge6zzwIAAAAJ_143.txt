However, their comparative training performance under real-world resource-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) device settings remains barely studied. This work provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning performance of SL is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. Recently, FL and SL are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each of their benefits (e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation requirement of SL).
