We are moving towards IoT trend, where the number of smart sensing devices deployed around the world is growing at a rapid speed. With considering the number of sources and types of data from smart sources, the sensed data tends to new trend of research i.e. big data. Security will be a fundamental enabling factor of most IoT applications and big data, mechanisms must also be designed to protect communications enabled by such technologies. This paper analyses existing protocols and mechanisms to secure the IoT and big data, as well as security threats in the domain. We have broadly divided the IoT architecture into several layers to define properties, security issues and related \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16287567153454960894", "cites_id": ["16287567153454960894"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67636-4_25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_tAA5QcQCeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
