Although data can be kept encrypted in servers, the user does not have the ability to decide whom the data are shared with. Technically this is linked to the problem of who owns the data encryption keys required to decrypt the data. Currently, cloud service providers, rather than users, have full rights to the key. In practical terms this makes the users lose full control over their data. Trust and uptake of these applications can be increased by allowing patients to feel in control of their data, generally stored in cloud-based services.Objective: This paper addresses this security challenge by providing the user a way of controlling encryption keys independently of the cloud service provider. We provide a secure and usable system that enables a patient to share health information with doctors and specialists.Methods: We contribute a secure protocol for patients to share their data with doctors and others on the cloud while keeping complete ownership. We developed a simple, stereotypical health application and carried out security tests, performance tests, and usability tests with both students and doctors (N= 15).Results: We developed the health application as an app for Android mobile phones. We carried out the usability tests on potential participants and medical professionals. Of 20 participants, 14 (70%) either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt safer using our system. Using mixed methods, we show that participants agreed that privacy and security of health data are important and that our system addresses these issues.Conclusions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6759935316308608352", "cites_id": ["6759935316308608352"], "pub_url": "https://medinform.jmir.org/2016/2/e15/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YEUxwVod0F0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
