The insights gained from the analysis of the proposed negotiation algorithm lead us to the development of an efficient \"message piggybacking\" negotiation algorithm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6192913089644062465", "cites_id": ["6192913089644062465"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4420145/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AecZwaSl8VUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 1}}
