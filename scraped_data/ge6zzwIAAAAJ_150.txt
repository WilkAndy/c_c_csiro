There are also many IoT-based applications drawn significant attentions in recent years. With the increasing numbers of the connected devices in the IoT system, one of the challenging tasks is to ensure devices\u2019 authenticity, which allows users to have a high confidence in the decision. In addition, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT system and the resource-constrained devices, how to efficiently manage such system and guarantee the security and privacy for devices is concerned. In this article, we proposed a new blockchain-based authentication scheme to meet the challenges. Our proposed framework combines the blockchain technique and the modular square root algorithm to achieve an effective authentication process. Besides, we demonstrate the security and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8167884813464210112", "cites_id": ["8167884813464210112"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9490334/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wIrXaPYnWnEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
