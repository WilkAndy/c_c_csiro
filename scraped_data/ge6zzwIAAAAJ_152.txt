A large number of individuals and organizations are using them to store and share data, taking the benefits of mobility and affordability offered by these services. However, secure management of data in cloud storage services, more specifically supporting multi-party sharing in the context of a collaboration, is a challenging problem. The problem is further exacerbated if the data owner does not have any trust on the cloud storage providers and the data need regular updates from collaborating parties. A number of cryptographically enforced secure cloud storage solutions have been proposed to address this problem. One of the key issues with these solutions is the revocation of access to data for invalid users without moving the data (in the era of big data) and relying on the cloud service providers. In this paper, we introduce a cloud storage system that offers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5331982625900647706", "cites_id": ["5331982625900647706"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41019-016-0014-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GtVcvfIB_0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
