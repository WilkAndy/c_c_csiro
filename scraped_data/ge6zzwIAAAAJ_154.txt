However, traditional trustworthy methods somehow overlook the service equality which result into a \u201crich-get-richer\u201d effect and become a barrier for the novice services to startup and grow. This paper addresses this problem through a novel equitable trustworthy mechanism, which distinguished the difference between the novice and mature services over the trustworthy service recommendation. The results based on the real-world service ecosystem, i.e. ProgrammableWeb, show that our method achieves a better performance in equality guarantee and white-washing prevention. Thus it can promote the service ecosystem\u2019s healthy growth in a fair manner."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9754622618193920785", "cites_id": ["9754622618193920785"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-45391-9_43", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EYNwy5ZhX4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
