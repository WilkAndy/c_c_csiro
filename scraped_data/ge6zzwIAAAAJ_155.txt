Backed up by SOA, scientific workflows can bring together various scientific computing tools and resources all offered as services to answer complex research questions. However, studies conducted on my Experiment show that although the sharing of service-based capabilities opens a gateway to resource reuse, in practice, the degree of reuse is very low. This motivates us to propose ServiceMap to provide navigation support through the network of services in building scientific workflows. In this paper, we propose an extension of ServiceMap, i.e., ReputationNet that incorporates the reputation of services/workflows and their publishers to reinforce its capability in terms of service and workflow recommendations. We develop a novel model of the reputation aspects of the services \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18169446652795418722", "cites_id": ["18169446652795418722"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6274177/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YvhHAXfXJvwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
