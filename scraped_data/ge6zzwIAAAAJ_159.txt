In data science and engineering, such information is useful and sometimes even critical. In spite of that, provenance for big data is under-explored due to the challenges from the `Vs' of big data. In data analytics, users need to query history, reproduce intermediate or final results, tune models, and adjust parameters in runtime for making data-driven decisions. In addition, users need to evaluate data and pipeline trustworthiness. Towards realising these functionalities for big data provenance, we propose a solution, called LogProv, which needs to renovate data pipelines or even some of big data software infrastructure to generate structured logs for pipeline events, and then stores data and logs separately. The data are explicitly linked to the logs, which implicitly record pipeline semantics. Semantic information can be retrieved from the logs easily since \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6914070930407199583", "cites_id": ["6914070930407199583"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7840748/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X5PG_uC2818J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
