The information captured by IoT present an unprecedented opportunity to solve large-scale problems in those application domains to deliver services; example applications include precision agriculture, environment monitoring, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart cities. Like all other Internet based services in the past, IoT-based services are also being developed and deployed without security consideration. By nature, IoT devices and services are vulnerable to malicious cyber threats as they cannot be given the same protection that is received by enterprise services within an enterprise perimeter. While IoT services will play an important role in our daily life resulting in improved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 163, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9570482789257384139", "cites_id": ["9570482789257384139"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3013520", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yxCt5mMv0YQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 17, "2018": 32, "2019": 21, "2020": 35, "2021": 22, "2022": 24, "2023": 9}}
