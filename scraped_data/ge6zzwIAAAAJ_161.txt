Though data sharing has been recognized as an important security feature, these storage solutions mostly focus on three key properties: confidentiality, integrity and availability. Modern enterprise applications demand data is able to be shared within or across organizations. The challenge is how to securely share data in public clouds without increasing data movement and computation costs. This problem has been addressed in recent times by utilizing or developing new data encryption techniques such as identity-based encryption, attribute-based encryption and proxy-re-encryption. However, these techniques suffer from scalability and flexibility problems when dealing with big data and support for dynamic access control rules \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3317577047486727187", "cites_id": ["3317577047486727187"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7214087/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E4RvVr9mCi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
