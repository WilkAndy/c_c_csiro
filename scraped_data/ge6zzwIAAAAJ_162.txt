This special issue compiles a number of excellent technical contributions that significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the areas of orchestrating cloud resources, composing new cloud services from existing ones, increasing energy efficiency via cloud resource orchestration, and developing cloud-based image processing solutions. Over the past few years, cloud computing [1\u20134] has emerged as the latest and most dominant utility computing solution offering both hardware and software resources as virtualization-enabled services. Cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure currently provide application owners the option of deploying their applications over a network of a virtually infinite resource pool with practically no up-front capital investment and with operating cost \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7074080845995761674", "cites_id": ["7074080845995761674"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpe.3421", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CuD4oQwvLGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
