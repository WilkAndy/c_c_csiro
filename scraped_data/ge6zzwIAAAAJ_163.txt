The data owner should be able to share confidential data while delegating much of the burden of access control management to the Cloud and trusted enterprises. The lack of such methods to enhance privacy and security may hinder the growth of cloud computing. In particular, there is a growing need to better manage security keys of data shared in the Cloud. BYOD provides a first step to enabling secure and efficient key management, however, the data owner cannot guarantee that the data consumers device itself is secure. Furthermore, in current methods the data owner cannot revoke a particular data consumer or group efficiently. In this paper, we address these issues by incorporating a hardware \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4785076626483430072", "cites_id": ["4785076626483430072"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6973745/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uMKR4NYBaEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
