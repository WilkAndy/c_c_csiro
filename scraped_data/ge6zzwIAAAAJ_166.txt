Image data is the most commonly used multimedia data type. Various content based retrieval systems for image data have been developed based on image features such as texture, color, edge, and shape that can be extracted from the image. Three major inherent characteristics of the existing content based retrieval systems are imprecision, a large number of feature values and the user's preferences. Existing content based retrieval systems deal with\\imprecision\" providing partial information through user interfaces such as\\retrieve all the images that have color similar to this\". Moreover, these systems, developed on visual properties, lack of formal models.Moreover, these systems deal with all possible values of visual properties such as color. The visual properties are extracted from the image and stored into the database as an indexable summary information. The users are unable to express their needs in terms of such a large feature values. This leads to a paradigm of\\query by example image\". Furthermore, these systems provide a user interface to deal with the user's preferences. The user provides his/her preferences to the feature such as 0.8 to color and 0.2 to shape through the user interface. However, it is not easy for the user to provide preferences in terms of numeric values. To solve the problems, the paper proposes a fuzzy system for content based retrieval. The system models imprecision using fuzzy data model, and limits the values of visual properties within the range of human perception. Moreover, the proposed system allows users to provide their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11909897896815931268", "cites_id": ["11909897896815931268"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Surya-Nepal-2/publication/2737781_A_Fuzzy_System_for_Content_Based_Retrieval/links/0912f50c06a0bd6e1b000000/A-Fuzzy-System-for-Content-Based-Retrieval.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hK_iKgl1SKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2}}
