However, their behaviors are still more generic and universal to analyze due to their inherent goals and functions. Therefore, we can capture their behaviors by monitoring their system-level activities on files and processes. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system called \u201cPeeler\u201d (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler first identifies ransomware\u2019s inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed during the attack, processes execution patterns, and correlations among different kernel-level events by analysing a large-scaled OS-level provenance data collected from a diverse set of ransomware families. Peeler specifically uses a novel NLP-based deep learning model to fingerprint the contextual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4679674844125854239", "cites_id": ["4679674844125854239"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88418-5_12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H_pzDHqL8UAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 9, "2023": 7}}
