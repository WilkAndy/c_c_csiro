Deep learning models have many advantages over traditional Machine Learning (ML) models, particularly when there is a large amount of data available. Android malware detection or classification qualifies as a big data problem because of the fast booming number of Android malware, the obfuscation of Android malware, and the potential protection of huge values of data assets stored on the Android devices. It seems a natural choice to apply DL on Android malware detection. However, there exist challenges for researchers and practitioners, such as choice of DL architecture, feature extraction and processing, performance evaluation, and even gathering adequate data of high quality. In this survey, we aim to address the challenges by systematically reviewing the latest progress in DL-based Android \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8001100507045685887", "cites_id": ["8001100507045685887"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3417978", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f-qn_oSeCW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 28, "2022": 73, "2023": 51}}
