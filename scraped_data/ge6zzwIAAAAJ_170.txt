For this purpose, Collaborative Filtering (CF)-based technique has been a useful approach in that it is able to predict with high accuracy the QoS values of web services which are not invoked by the users. The basic idea behind CF-based techniques is that they identify users with similar QoS experiences and predict their QoS requirements on web services accordingly. However, as the calculation of QoS values and user similarity require parameters which may contain privacy sensitive information, users may not trust the server that provides such third-party recommendations. In general, users are usually not willing to disclose such information to a third-party as it contains their tastes and preferences as well as experiences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9135932812863635599", "cites_id": ["9135932812863635599"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8482447/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j4CSMn1ayX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
