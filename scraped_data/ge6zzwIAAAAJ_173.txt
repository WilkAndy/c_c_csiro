Our constructions are the first to provide forward/backward security in the context of SSE-based schemes supporting geometric range search. Besides, we define a security notion called content privacy. This security notion captures the leakages that are critical in the context of geometric range search but not considered by forward/backward security. Content privacy eliminates the leakage on the updated points of the database during both search and update. Due to the inherent leakages associated with range queries, none of the existing related works can support content privacy, whereas the design of our constructions avoids such leakages. When compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, our constructions provide a higher level of security and practical efficiency supported by our experimental results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15867156529960461876", "cites_id": ["15867156529960461876"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9044334/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NCbQ08t2M9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
