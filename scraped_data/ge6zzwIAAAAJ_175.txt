With the wide adoption of service-oriented architecture and cloud manufacturing, manufacturing enterprises and organisations publish their manufacturing capability, such as resources, processes and knowledge as manufacturing services. A rapidly growing manufacturing service ecosystem can be observed nowadays, which brings the information overload problem for the service selection. Thus, how to organise these services and how to recommend the reputable services become two important issues for the manufacturing service retrieval and reuse. In this paper, the service cluster method WSTPCluster, which develops the topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, is employed to cluster services into specific domains. As the service ecosystem can be modelled as a heterogeneous service \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12138450085248194147", "cites_id": ["12138450085248194147"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0951192X.2014.961964", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y1YHTwpwdKgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
