Recently, forward and backward privacy in DSSE receive wide attention due to the rise in a number of emerging attacks exploiting the leakage in data update operations. Forward privacy ensures newly added data is not related to queries issued in the past, whilst backward privacy ensures previously deleted data is not revealed in the queries. Unfortunately, achieving strong forward and backward privacy, i.e., only revealing insertion timestamps of search results, requires the adoption of oblivious data structures, which incur heavy computation and communication overhead at both the client and server-side. In this paper, we resort to secure enclaves, aka Intel SGX, to tackle the above problem. Specifically, we propose Maiden, the first strong backward-private DSSE scheme without relying on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3363654581172630108", "cites_id": ["3363654581172630108"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-78372-3_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XPLoKQUari4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
