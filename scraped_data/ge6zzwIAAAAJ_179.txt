Recent advances in information and communication technologies enable collection of real-time information from various sources. For example, sensors deployed in the fields collect data about the environment. Similarly, social networks like Twitter and Facebook can help to collect data from people in the disaster zone. On one hand, inadequate situation awareness in disasters has been identified as one of the primary factors in human errors with grave consequences such as loss of lives and destruction of critical infrastructure. On the other hand, the growing ubiquity of social media and mobile devices, and pervasive nature of the Internet-of-Things means that there are more sources of outbound traffic, which ultimately results in the creation of a data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16112120881965070987", "cites_id": ["16112120881965070987"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43795-4_12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i3quk5PAmd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
