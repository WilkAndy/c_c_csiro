Sub-tree data anonymization is a widely adopted scheme to anonymize data sets for privacy preservation. Top\u2013Down Specialization (TDS) and Bottom\u2013Up Generalization (BUG) are two ways to fulfill sub-tree anonymization. However, existing approaches for sub-tree anonymization fall short of parallelization capability, thereby lacking scalability in handling big data in cloud. Still, either TDS or BUG individually suffers from poor performance for certain valuing of k-anonymity parameter. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines TDS and BUG together for efficient sub-tree anonymization over big data. Further, we design MapReduce algorithms for the two components (TDS and BUG) to gain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4247057604371588304", "cites_id": ["4247057604371588304"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000014000191", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0KQwqWOU8DoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 15, "2016": 20, "2017": 23, "2018": 14, "2019": 20, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
