Similarly, many research communities use workflow environments and tools such as Taverna and Galaxy to model the execution of tasks to support and expedite the reenactment of complex processes, and ultimately support the repeatability of science. As a result, a number of systems that integrate clouds with these workflow systems have emerged including CloudMap, CloudMan, Galaxy cloud, BioBlend, etc. Though these systems have proven to be successful in service and data integration, they have not dealt with the data security issue inherent in cloud-based systems with the outsourced models of infrastructure provisioning. For many domains, e.g., health, this poses serious challenges regarding the adoption of cloud infrastructures. Yet such domains also have much to gain from clouds especially given the explosion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11123671655540352636", "cites_id": ["11123671655540352636"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7296593/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fGaQWm84X5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
