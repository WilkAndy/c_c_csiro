The gaps in health service availability and outcomes between people in urban areas and those in remote parts of our country are well known. Telehealth, the provision of health related services at a distance using technology assisted communications, offers a means to narrow this gap by improving the level and diversity of services in remote areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8372310147268082475", "cites_id": ["8372310147268082475"], "pub_url": "https://mro-ns.massey.ac.nz/handle/10179/12185", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K_tPdbhrMHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
