However, this also entails privacy risks to the provider's proprietary model and the client's sensitive data. Focusing on inference with decision trees, this article proposes a framework for securely and efficiently outsourcing decision tree inference. Targeting both privacy and efficiency, we propose a customized protocol using only lightweight cryptography in the online execution of secure inference. We resort to additive secret sharing and tackle the problems in various components including secure input feature selection, decision node evaluation, and inference result generation. Our protocol requires no interaction from the provider and client during online secure inference, a distinct advantage over prior works for practical deployment as they all operate under the client-provider setting where synchronous and continuous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Wq2b2clWBLsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16118455575631769570", "cites_id": ["16118455575631769570"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9268141/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4i9yYfJBsN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
