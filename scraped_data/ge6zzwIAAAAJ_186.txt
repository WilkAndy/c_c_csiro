To make such a platform useful in practice in a Security Operation Center (SOC), we need to address three key challenges: interpretability, interoperability, and automation. In this paper, we proposed a novel semantic integration approach to automatically select and integrate security tools with essential capability for auto-execution of an incident response process in a security orchestration platform. The capability of security tools and the activities of the incident response process are formalized using ontologies, which have been used for NLP based approach to classify the activities for the emerging incident response processes. The developed ontologies and NLP approaches have been used for an interoperability model for selection and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14407720420591346851", "cites_id": ["14407720420591346851"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21290-2_32", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oyR9HGOB8scJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
