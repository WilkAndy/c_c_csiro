Because the decision makers may not own all the necessary sensing infrastructures, crowdsourced sensing can help collect important information about the city in near real-time. However, involving people brings the risk of exposing their private information. This chapter explores crowdsensing in smart city applications and its privacy implications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=650403927772411779", "cites_id": ["650403927772411779"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128150320000056", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7dkI-2yBgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
