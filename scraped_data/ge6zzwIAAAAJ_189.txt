As a result, a large number of social network analytics tools have been developed for a variety of applications. A snapshot of social networks at any particular time, called a social graph, represents the connectivity of nodes and potentially the flow of information amongst the nodes (or vertices) in the graph. Understanding the flow of information in a social graph plays an important role in social network applications. Two specific problems related to information flow have implications in many social network applications: (a) finding a minimum set of nodes one has to know to recover the whole graph (also known as the vertex cover \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8029529574012246270", "cites_id": ["8029529574012246270"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7207259/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_lh-9Jqebm8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
