Telehealth services have emerged as a promising solution to narrow this health gap, as they improve the level and diversity of health services delivery to rural and remote Australian communities. Although the benefits of telehealth services are well studied and understood, the uptake has been very slow. Materials and Methods: To understand the underpinning issues, we conducted a literature review on barriers to telehealth adoption in rural and remote Australian communities, based on the published works of Australian clinical trials and studies. Results: This article presents our findings using a comprehensive barrier matrix. This matrix is composed of four stakeholders (governments, technology developers and providers, health professionals, and patients) and five different categorizations of barriers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18033308458038736159", "cites_id": ["18033308458038736159"], "pub_url": "https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/tmj.2013.0189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HzVyfn8uQ_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 20, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 18, "2021": 30, "2022": 26, "2023": 10}}
