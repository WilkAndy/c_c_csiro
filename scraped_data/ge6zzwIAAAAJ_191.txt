This big data can pose a challenge to the community members as well as moderators in reviewing the development of discussions and in understanding the social behaviour of the community. For the data to be useful, it is thus important to employ appropriate data abstraction and visualisation tools. We implemented a gamification based data abstraction and social behaviour based visualisation method in the context of Next Step, a year long trial conducted in partnership with the Australian Government Department of Human Services to deliver support services to citizens in a transitioning phase. The trial has been useful in drawing lessons that could be important for a scaled-up implementation of such government services.
