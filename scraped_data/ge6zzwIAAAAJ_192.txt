To address the first issue, we propose a new tag-based data model for representation of electronic medical records along with patients\u2019 policy statements. This model helps to categorize the patient information as well as express patients\u2019 consent for a variety of domains, such as individual practitioner and facility. To address the second issue, this paper proposes a way of establishing a trust relationship between two interacting parties based on emerging trusted computing technologies, and describes its application and implementation in an electronic healthcare system. Our proposed solutions have been demonstrated by developing a prototype system \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15198381743849212355", "cites_id": ["15198381743849212355"], "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/article/trusted-system-sharing-patient-electronic/2197", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wwnq6qt_69IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
