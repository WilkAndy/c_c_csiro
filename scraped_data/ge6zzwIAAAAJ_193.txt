While the proliferation of IoT systems promises many benefits for different sectors, it also exposes a large attack surface, raising an imperative need to put security in the first place. It is impractical to heavily rely on manual operations to deal with security of massive IoT devices and applications. Hence, there is a strong need for securing IoT systems with minimum human intervention. In light of this situation, in this paper, we envision security automation and orchestration for IoT systems. After conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the literature and having conversations with industry partners, we envision a framework integrating key elements towards this goal. For each element, we investigate the existing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15052218289425944776", "cites_id": ["15052218289425944776"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9325393/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yBDfvsg45NAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
