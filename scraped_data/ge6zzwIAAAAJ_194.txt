The widely available CoAP implementations have failed to validate the remote CoAP clients. Each CoAP client generates a random source port number when communicating with the CoAP server. However, we observe that in such implementations it is difficult to distinguish the regular packet and the malicious packet, opening a door for a potential off-path attack. The off-path attack is considered a weak attack on a constrained network and has received a less attention from the research community. However, the consequences resulting from such an attack cannot be ignored in practice. In this article, we exploit the combination of IP spoofing vulnerability and the remote server access support of CoAP is to be launch an off-path attack. The attacker injects a fake request \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11326895037679708191", "cites_id": ["11326895037679708191"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8843970/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H6gIOQY3MZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
