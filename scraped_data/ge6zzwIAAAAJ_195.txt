Moreover, asymmetric nature of resources between layers makes it hard to establish a balance between security and performance - e.g., lightweight cryptography may degrade security level against untrusted nodes while heavyweight ones may not be feasible for the light-weight end devices. An advanced encryption scheme such as the Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) is a popular technique to reduce storage and communication overhead. However, IBBE requires heavy computation to the end devices and still does not fully satisfy the security requirements that exist in the layers of edge computing.
