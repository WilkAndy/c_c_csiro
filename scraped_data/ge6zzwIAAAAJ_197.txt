The big health data may contain valuable knowledge and new business opportunities. Obviously, cloud is a good candidate to collect, store and analyse such big health care data. However, health care data is very sensitive for its owners, and thus should be well protected on cloud. This paper presents our solution to protecting and analyzing health care data stored on cloud. First, we develop novel technologies to protect data privacy and enable secure data sharing on cloud. Secondly, we show the methods and tools to conduct big health care data analysis. Finally, both the security technology and the data analysis methods are evaluated to show the usefulness and efficiency of our solution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7672748569783405374", "cites_id": ["7672748569783405374"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7176084/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PovTGCwUe2oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
