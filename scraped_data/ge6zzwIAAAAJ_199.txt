However, due to the sensitiveness of the medical system and the capability limitation of the wearable devices, security, privacy, and efficiency of the healthcare services in WBANs are remained as major challenges. Although different authentication mechanisms have been designed to meet the challenges in recent years, most of them suffer from some functional defects or security problems. In this article, we firstly provide a review and cryptanalysis on the state-of-the-art authentication scheme. In order to meet the challenges and address the drawbacks in previous works, we then propose a new efficient and anonymous authentication scheme for cloud based WBANs. Through the security analysis, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4aZ_i-5WJEQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2725892230022214706", "cites_id": ["2725892230022214706"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9356350/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MrR4copQ1CUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
