It has been widely used in many applications including smart cities such as public water system, power grid, water management, and vehicle traffic control system. In these smart city applications, a large number of IoT devices are deployed that can sense, communicate, compute, and potentially actuate. The uninterrupted and accurate functioning of these devices are critical to smart city applications as crucial decisions will be made based on the data received. One of the challenging tasks is to assure the authenticity of the devices so that we can rely on the decision making process with a very high confidence. One of the characteristics of IoT devices deployed in such applications is that they have limited battery power. A challenge is to design a secure mutual authentication protocol which is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13755287004666404135", "cites_id": ["13755287004666404135"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7953561/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jx2w8KaY5L4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 13, "2019": 30, "2020": 29, "2021": 25, "2022": 29, "2023": 8}}
