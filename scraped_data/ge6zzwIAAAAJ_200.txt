In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14117763603540403588", "cites_id": ["14117763603540403588"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9141406/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hOX2wzJf7MMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
