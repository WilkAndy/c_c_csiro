Virtualization is designed to be transparent, that is, unprivileged users should not be able to detect whether a system is virtualized. Such detection can result in serious security threats such as evading virtual machine (VM)-based malware dynamic analysis and exploiting vulnerabilities for cross-VM attacks. The traditional software-based virtualization leaves numerous artifacts/fingerprints, which can be exploited without much effort to detect the virtualization. In contrast, current mainstream hardware-assisted virtualization significantly enhances the virtualization transparency, making itself more transparent and difficult to be detected. Nonetheless, we showcase three new identified low-level inconspicuous features, which can be leveraged by an unprivileged adversary to effectively and stealthily detect the hardware-assisted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17796397237862747318", "cites_id": ["17796397237862747318"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9122497/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tkyNnP-A-fYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
