One of the key challenges of SOC is to quickly integrate security tools and operational activities. To address this challenge, an increasing number of organizations are using Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) platforms, whose design needs suitable architectural support. This paper presents our work on architecture-centric support for designing a SOAR platform. Our approach consists of a conceptual map of SOAR platform and the key dimensions of an architecture design space. We have demonstrated the use of the approach in designing and implementing a Proof of Concept (PoC) SOAR platform for (i) automated integration of security tools and (ii) automated interpretation of activities to execute incident response processes. We also report a preliminary evaluation of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16448231352464850663", "cites_id": ["16448231352464850663"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58923-3_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5z4cw0TbQ-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
