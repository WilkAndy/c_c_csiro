To mitigate these attacks, physical domain isolation, introduced by CATT, physically separates each domain by dividing the physical memory into multiple partitions and keeping each partition occupied by only one domain. CATT implemented physical kernel isolation as the first generic and practical software-only defense to protect kernel from being rowhammered as kernel is one of the most appealing targets. In this paper, we develop a novel exploit that could effectively defeat the CATT implementation and gain both root and kernel privileges, indicating that the physical kernel isolation is not secure in practice. Our exploit can work without exhausting the page cache or the system memory, or relying on the information of the virtual-to-physical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12804478587263955381", "cites_id": ["12804478587263955381"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8865632/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tbH2H2-lsrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
