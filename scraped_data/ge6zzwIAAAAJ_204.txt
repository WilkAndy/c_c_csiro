Publication of such location data can provide valuable resources for researchers and government agencies in applications ranging from near real-time population-wide health monitoring to planning for future cities. However, such data hold personally identifying information, which gives rise to many privacy issues. There is thus a pressing need for ways to restrict this inherently identifying location-related information, however ideally we would like to preserve the utility of the data. Importantly, any such solution has to be scalable to large population-wide data scenarios. To tackle this, we introduce a novel differentially private hierarchical location sanitization (DPHLS) approach based on the concept \u201c(\u03b1, r)-dataset\u201d implemented \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6464071696868898963", "cites_id": ["6464071696868898963"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7840718/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k_iGzvX-tFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
