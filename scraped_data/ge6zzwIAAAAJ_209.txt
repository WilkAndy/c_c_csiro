In recent times, however, such techniques have inherently exposed limitations in detecting unknown malware samples and maintaining the database up-to-date, as many polymorphic and metamorphic malware samples are newly created and spread very quickly throughout the Internet. To address the limitations of existing signature-based malware scanners, we take a different view and focus on designing a novel malware detection framework, called MEDUSA (MalwarE Detection Using Statistical Analysis of system's behavior), for building a model for a system's behaviors with normal processes. Unlike traditional approaches for malware detection, MEDUSA has the potential to effectively detect unknown malware samples because it is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9785343264349973545", "cites_id": ["9785343264349973545"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8537842/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KWzXnNqFzIcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
