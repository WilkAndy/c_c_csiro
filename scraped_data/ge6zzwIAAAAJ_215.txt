Many software-based solutions have been proposed to solve such privacy concerns by means of end-to-end data encryption such as PGP, OpenPGP, and S/MIME. These solutions pose yet another challenging issue for the secure and trusted management of cryptographic keys they utilize. To address this issue, we propose a new protocol for a Trusted Email System using hardware-based cryptographic functionality of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and the Ephemerizer concept. By leveraging the advantages of these two technologies, our protocol provides a safeguard to cryptographic keys so that only designated email senders and recipients can read email messages. Furthermore, our protocol guarantees that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12528608063001458887", "cites_id": ["12528608063001458887"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4594709/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x_hLZaeO3q0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
