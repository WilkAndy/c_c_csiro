Proceedings, Part I", "pages": "426-443", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg", "abstract": "One method for establishing a trust relationship between two servers in a co-operative information system is to use a mutual attestation protocol based on hardware that implements the Trusted Computing Group\u2019s TPM specification. It has been our experience in developing an eHealth demonstration system that the efficiency of such a protocol was relatively low. This inefficiency was a result of the high number of TPM function calls in response to the large number of protocol messages that must be sent by the end server systems to establish mutual trust between them prior to sending each application message (in our case, a medical record). In order to address this inefficiency, we developed a session-based mutual attestation protocol, where multiple application messages are sent over an interval of time where an established trust relationship holds. Moreover, the protocol partially addresses the security flaw due to the time interval between the time-of-attestation and time-of-use. This paper presents this new protocol, once again utilizing TPM microcontroller hardware, and compares its performance with that of our previous (per record) mutual attestation protocol."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17410791640149540854", "cites_id": ["17410791640149540854"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Surya-Nepal-2/publication/220830000_Establishing_a_Trust_Relationship_in_Cooperative_Information_Systems/links/0912f50be7993c5705000000/Establishing-a-Trust-Relationship-in-Cooperative-Information-Systems.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9j90GcCOn_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
