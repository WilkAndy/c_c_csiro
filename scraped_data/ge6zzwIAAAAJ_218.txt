The existing object recognition techniques can not directly identify image objects at the semantic level in a large collection of images. To overcome this problem, we model semantic information at two di erent levels: system designer and user level. Our approach is to involve both the system designer and the user in de ning and storing the semantic information at the corresponding levels to enable e cient content based retrieval. In this paper, we propose a four layer schema for modeling image data. The bottom two layers store raw image data, object and image feature information (such as color and texture). The upper two layers contain semantic information. We have identi ed the types of information to be stored in each layer and provide a framework for content based retrieval using semantic information. The preliminary results from our prototype implementation indicate that our approach is promising."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17799322441644367564", "cites_id": ["17799322441644367564"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/40654142/A_Four_Layer_Schema_for_Image_Data_Model20151205-30289-14r4bze.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zN7ZsHTlA_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
