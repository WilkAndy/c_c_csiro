However, recently proposed software-only mitigations are not effective against such kernel privilege escalation attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and practical software-only defense, called SoftTRR, to protect page tables from all existing rowhammer attacks on x86. The key idea of SoftTRR is to refresh the rows occupied by page tables when a suspicious rowhammer activity is detected. SoftTRR is motivated by DRAM-chip-based target row refresh (ChipTRR) but eliminates its main security limitation (ie, ChipTRR tracks a limited number of rows and thus can be bypassed by many-sided hammer [17]). Specifically, SoftTRR protects an unlimited number of page tables by tracking memory accesses to the rows that are in close proximity to page-table rows and refreshing the page-table rows once the tracked access count exceeds a pre-defined threshold. We implement a prototype of SoftTRR as a loadable kernel module, and evaluate its security effectiveness, performance overhead, and memory consumption. The experimental results show that SoftTRR protects page tables from real-world rowhammer attacks and incurs small performance overhead as well as memory cost."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=771704161513990025", "cites_id": ["771704161513990025"], "pub_url": "https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc22/presentation/zhang-zhi", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iWe7otiktQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
