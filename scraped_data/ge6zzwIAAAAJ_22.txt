Data sets like electronic health records in such applications often contain privacy-sensitive information, which brings about privacy concerns potentially if the information is released or shared to third-parties in cloud. A practical and widely-adopted technique for data privacy preservation is to anonymize data via generalization to satisfy a given privacy model. However, most existing privacy preserving approaches tailored to small-scale data sets often fall short when encountering big data, due to their insufficiency or poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate the local-recoding problem for big data anonymization against proximity privacy breaches and attempt to identify a scalable solution to this problem. Specifically, we present a proximity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11093284723155537748", "cites_id": ["11093284723155537748"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6911981/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VA_0U65D85kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 15, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 25, "2020": 16, "2021": 18, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
