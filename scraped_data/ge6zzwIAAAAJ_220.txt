We investigate the trends behind password formulation in an exploratory study to postulate that social identity and language play a major role in users\u2019 general attitude toward formulating passwords. For this, we conduct a descriptive analysis of two publicly available datasets containing real username and password combinations to determine whether these socio-cultural factors play a formative role in how users formulate their passwords across countries.
