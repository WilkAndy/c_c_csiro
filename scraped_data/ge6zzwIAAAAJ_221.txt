Recently invented by Jarek Duda asymmetric numeral system (ANS) offers an improved efficiency and a close to optimal compression. The ANS algorithm has been deployed by major IT companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple. Compression by itself does not provide any security (such as confidentiality or authentication of transmitted data). An obvious solution to this problem is an encryption of compressed bitstream. However, it requires two algorithms: one for compression and the other for encryption. In this work, we investigate natural properties of ANS that allow to incorporate authenticated encryption using as little cryptography as possible. We target low-level security communication and storage such as transmission of data from IoT devices/sensors. In particular, we propose three solutions for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:c1e4I3QdEKYC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5022695872436571936", "cites_id": ["5022695872436571936"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9478894/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IA9n20gztEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
