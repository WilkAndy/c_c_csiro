To improve service quality, healthcare data sharing in third-party environments needs to ensure the integrity, source authentication, and privacy of the data. Redactable signature schemes (RSSs) are designed to address this concern over the past decades. More concretely, an RSS allows a signature holder to delete privacy-sensitive parts of the signed data and derive a valid signature for the retained data without any help from the original signer. This also provides a flexible data sharing mechanism in a bandwidth-saving manner. However, almost all of the existing RSSs are built on top of public-key infrastructure (PKI) systems, which involve heavyweight public-key management problems and are not suitable for resource-limited IoT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:hvmnpdAuIbkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2434255195092110308", "cites_id": ["2434255195092110308"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9354855/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5Esd5DM2yCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
