Although PUFs provide the potential for lightweight and secure authentication for increasing numbers of low-end Internet of Things devices, practical and secure mechanisms remain elusive. We aim to explore simulatable PUFs (SimPUFs) that are physically unclonable but efficiently modeled mathematically through privileged one-time PUF access to address the above problem. Given a challenge, a securely stored SimPUF in possession of a trusted server computes the corresponding response and its bit-specific reliability. Consequently, naturally noisy PUF responses generated by a resource limited prover can be immediately processed by a one-way function (OWF) and transmitted to the server, because the resourceful server can exploit the SimPUF to perform a trial-and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15351969909612676669", "cites_id": ["15351969909612676669"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9091218/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PQbzaEsnDdUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
