Systems adhering to these paradigms exhibit a number of characteristics such as high levels of heterogeneity and dynamicity, leading to high complexity, that exacerbate the problems associated with traditional cyber defence. These problems are further exacerbated when edge-oriented systems operate in adversarial environments, e.g. the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT). Current generations of cyber defence approaches straddling attack prevention, detection, response and tolerance are arguably insufficient for edge-oriented systems operating in IoBT environments, especially given the constant increase in cyber attack sophistication. In this paper, we propose proactive antifragility as a new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14399154105499987620", "cites_id": ["14399154105499987620"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8998511/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pC5vdF4S1McJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
