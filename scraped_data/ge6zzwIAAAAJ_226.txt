Since secured authentication of these resource-constrained sensors is one of the important considerations during communication, use of asymmetric key distribution scheme may not be the perfect choice to achieve secure authentication. Recent research shows that Lucky Thirteen attack has compromised Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode for key establishment. Even though EAKES6Lo and S3K techniques for key establishment follow the symmetric key establishment method, they strongly rely on a remote server and trust anchor for secure key distribution. Our proposed Lightweight Authentication Protocol (LAUP) used a symmetric key method with no preshared keys and comprised of four flights to establish authentication and session key distribution between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8289747325063700631", "cites_id": ["8289747325063700631"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8029463/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l6AqbEUZC3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
