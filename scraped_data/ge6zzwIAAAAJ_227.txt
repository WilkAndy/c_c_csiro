A few questions then arise, e.g., what is the effectiveness of one's engagement on social media? Who is being reached? Is it the intended audience? What is the impact? Or, as some ask, what is the Return on Investment (ROI)? In our work, we are attempting to answer these questions. We suggest that the ROI is multifaceted, and present a framework (CAMIO) to study it. We also describe a system, called TweetRipple, built on CAMIO to support for people to start answering these questions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7038583513501248552", "cites_id": ["7038583513501248552"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7809714/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KKwp3GkSrmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
