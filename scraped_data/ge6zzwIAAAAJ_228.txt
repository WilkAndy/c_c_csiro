The successful deployment of such novel sensor-based applications requires the development of suitable cloud-based cyberinfrastructures able to manage the sensors and the data collected by these sensors. The paper elaborates on key challenges in developing such infrastructures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7019026905312293436", "cites_id": ["7019026905312293436"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7331182/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PHIMMMiXaGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
