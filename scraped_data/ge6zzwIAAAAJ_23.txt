Therefore, we present CloudRecommender, a new declarative approach for selecting Cloud-based infrastructure services. CloudRecommender automates the mapping of users\u2019 specified application requirements to cloud service configurations. We formally capture cloud service configurations in ontology and provide its implementation in a structured data model which can be manipulated through both regular expressions and SQL. By exploiting the power of a visual programming language (widgets), CloudRecommender further enables simplified and intuitive cloud service selection. We describe the design and a prototype implementation of CloudRecommender, and demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability through a service configuration selection experiment on most of today\u2019s prominent cloud \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4601108122140852133", "cites_id": ["4601108122140852133"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35194-5_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pb9emXVr2j8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 13, "2015": 15, "2016": 22, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
