Many recommender systems leverage articulated social networks or profile information (e.g, user background, interest, etc.) for content recommendation. These recommenders largely ignore the implied networks defined through user interactions. Yet these play an important role in formulating users\u2019 common interests. We propose an interaction based content recommender which leverages implicit user interactions to determine the relationship trust or strength, generating a richer, more informed implied network. An offline analysis on a 5000 person, 12 week dataset from an online community shows that our approach outperforms algorithms which focus on articulated networks that do not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1196221622788749188", "cites_id": ["1196221622788749188"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hPf2YjrVmRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3}}
