This limits the portability and mobility of trust as demanded by many emerging applications that go beyond the organizational boundaries. In order to address this problem, we propose a trusted computing platform in a form of a USB device. First, we describe the design and implementation of the hardware and software architectures of the device. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed device by developing a trusted application."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2389178269809745990", "cites_id": ["2389178269809745990"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5703614/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RqAXXfoQKCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
