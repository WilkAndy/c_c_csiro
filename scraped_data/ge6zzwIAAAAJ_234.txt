The providers do this in order to deliver effective, well-understood services for their customers and minimise the risk associated with developing solutions from a variety of different technologies. They each deliver a particular solution for their customers. However, from the customers' point of view, the provisioning of innovative, customised services that go beyond the services of a single infrastructure provider is very attractive. This paper presents a service-oriented architecture based on a well-established business model - the virtual network operator (VNO) - that allows the providers to meet their customers' complex requirements. Our proposed architecture uses virtualisation techniques to abstract the infrastructure services in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3041516455664780386", "cites_id": ["3041516455664780386"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4278636/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YoRnDhqjNSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
