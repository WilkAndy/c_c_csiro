Deep clustering algorithms for anomaly detection gain significant research attention in this era. We propose an intelligent anomaly detection for extensive network traffic analysis with an Optimized Deep Clustering (ODC) algorithm. Firstly, ODC does the optimization of the deep AutoEncoder algorithm by tuning the hyperparameters. Thereby we can achieve a reduced reconstruction error rate from the deep AutoEncoder. Secondly, ODC feeds the optimized deep AutoEncoder's latent view to the BIRCH clustering algorithm to detect the known and unknown malicious network traffic without human intervention. Unlike other deep clustering algorithms, ODC does not require to specify the number of clusters needed to analyze the network traffic dataset.
