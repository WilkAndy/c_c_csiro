Our model enables the local data curator to provide a freely accessible public generative model derived from original data for cloud storage. Compared with existing approaches, PART-GAN has three key advantages: It enables the generation of an unlimited amount of synthetic time series data under the guidance of a given classification label and addresses the incomplete and temporal irregularity issues. It provides a robust privacy guarantee that satisfies differential privacy to time series data augmentation and sharing. It addresses the trade-offs between utility and privacy by applying optimization strategies. We evaluate and report the utility and efficacy of PART-GAN through extensive empirical evaluations of real-world health/medical datasets.
