Since secured authentication is one of the important considerations, the use of asymmetric key distribution scheme may not be a perfect choice. Recent research shows that Lucky Thirteen attack has compromised Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode for key establishment. Even though EAKES6Lo and S3\u2009K techniques for key establishment follow the symmetric key establishment method, they strongly rely on a remote server and trust anchor. Our proposed Lightweight Authentication Protocol (LAUP) used a symmetric key method with no preshared keys and comprised of four flights to establish authentication and session key distribution between sensors and Edge Router in a 6LoWPAN environment. Each flight uses freshly derived keys from existing information such \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15035569537194452983", "cites_id": ["15035569537194452983"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpe.4868", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9-coDNUSqdAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
