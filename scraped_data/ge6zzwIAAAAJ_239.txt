The password authentication protocol transmits passwords in plaintext, which makes the authentication vulnerable to eavesdropping and replay attacks, and several protocols have been proposed to protect against this. However, we find that secure password authentication protocols are often implemented incorrectly in Android applications (apps). To detect the implementation flaws in password authentication code, we propose GLACIATE, a fully automated tool combining machine learning and program analysis. Instead of creating detection templates/rules manually, GLACIATE automatically and accurately learns the common authentication flaws from a relatively small training dataset, and then identifies whether the authentication flaws exist in other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15076633040411334062", "cites_id": ["15076633040411334062"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29959-0_30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rpWi7t71OtEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
