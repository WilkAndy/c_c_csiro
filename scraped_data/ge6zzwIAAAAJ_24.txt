With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem in a wide range of applications, IoT devices and data are going to be traded as commodities in the marketplace in the near future, similar to cloud services or physical objects. Developing such a trading platform has previously been identified as one of the key grand challenges in the integration of IoT and data science. Deployment of such a platform raises concerns about the security and privacy of data and devices since their ownership is hard to trace and manage without a central trusted authority. A central trusted authority is not a viable solution for a fully decentralized and distributed IoT ecosystem with a large number of distributed device vendors and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16503995451902995427", "cites_id": ["16503995451902995427"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8436081/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4ytX7Wv4CeUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 22, "2020": 27, "2021": 23, "2022": 31, "2023": 10}}
