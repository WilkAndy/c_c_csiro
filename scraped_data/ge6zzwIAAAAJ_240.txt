Such data can be beneficial to better plan and manage individual's activities and other social applications, e.g., location-based advertisement or recommendation. However, only a very small proportion of tweets are geotagged due to privacy concerns or lack of underlying positioning infrastructures. Hence it is meaningful to estimate the geographic information for non-geotagged tweets, i.e., geocoding, which can help to improve the applicability and utility of social media data. Contrary to existing geocoding approaches, this paper aims at the privacy risk and providing a fine-grained estimation. In this paper, we propose Privacy-preserving GEocoding of Non-geotagged Tweets (P-GENT) for geocoding non-geotagged tweets with fine \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11937843505304413712", "cites_id": ["11937843505304413712"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8456006/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EKbfLWu9q6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
