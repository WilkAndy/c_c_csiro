It becomes even more challenging for IoT applications due to the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of IoT data including volume, velocity, variety, volatility, and heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the impact of varying velocity and volume of IoT data streams on (a) the performance of the data ingestion and storage process, and (b) the corresponding cloud resource utilization. We use the open-source OpenIoT platform as our test bed and run experiments under different data streaming settings. We study the throughput and error rate, as well as CPU and memory consumption during the ingestion process. Experimental results reveal some interesting insights into the performance of OpenIoT and allow us to draw more general observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3029138368925395830", "cites_id": ["3029138368925395830"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8181507/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dutNJ0ypCSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
