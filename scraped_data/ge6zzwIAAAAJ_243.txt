Each ballot is treated as a square matrix, with each element encrypted using the ElGamal cryptosystem before submission. Furthermore, proof of partial knowledge and zero knowledge are used to verify the eligibility of ballots without accessing ballot contents. We also implement a prototype to test our proposed voting system. The security and performance analysis indicate the feasibility of the proposed protocols."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13006776513469884674", "cites_id": ["13006776513469884674"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68786-5_39", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AilEflNagbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
