Though the use of social media in public sectors is increasing, the adoption path is not easy and straightforward. Furthermore, in many situations, the use is still in an infancy stage when it is measured against pre-set objectives. The aim of this chapter is multiple folds. The chapter first provides a brief introduction of social media and types of social media. It then describes the adoption process in government. This is followed by some example applications where social media has been successfully used. A few key challenges that are proven to be difficult in adopting social media are given. Finally, the chapter provides a framework to define guidelines and policies to overcome these challenges."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5384620996297841351", "cites_id": ["5384620996297841351"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-27237-5_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x1pxZkQEukoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
