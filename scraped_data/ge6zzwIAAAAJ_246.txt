We present a novel use of context in the form of customized user interface services with the concept of User Interface as a Service (UIaaS). UIaaS takes user profiles as input to generate context-aware interface services. Such interface services can be used as context to augment semantic services with contextual information leading to UIaaS as a Context (UIaaSaaC). The added serendipitous benefit of the proposed concept is that the composition of a customized user interface with the requested service is performed by the service composition engine, as is the case with any other services. We use a special-purpose language (called User Interface Description Language (UIDL)) to model and realize user interfaces as services. We use a real-life e-government application, human services delivery for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10199531620317960234", "cites_id": ["10199531620317960234"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2078316.2078322", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KphqIPgDjI0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
