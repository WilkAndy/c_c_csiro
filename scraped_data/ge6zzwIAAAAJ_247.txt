Consider a query such as retrieve images similar to I1 by color AND with associated text flower. Suppose we have a color subsystem which can return a sorted list of images based on similarity with I1 and a text subsystem which can return a sorted list of images based on similarity with flower. Our task is to combine these two results. In other words, we need to evaluate the fuzzy combining function AND, giving a sorted list of the images.Fagin has proved that the probabilistic complexity of the problem is almost linear (Fagin 1996), and our multi-step algorithm (Nepal & M. V. Ramakrishna 1999) is an optimal uniform algorithm (Fagin, Lotem & Naor 2001). In view of this inherent limitation, we investigated a non-uniform heuristic approach. In this paper, we discuss the problems of processing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4372379578059485486", "cites_id": ["4372379578059485486"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/563906.563922", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LnFodQ_QrTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
