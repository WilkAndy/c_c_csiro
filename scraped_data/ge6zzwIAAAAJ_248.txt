Moreover, organizations have been loath to share emails, given the risk of leaking commercially sensitive information. Consequently, it has been difficult to obtain sufficient emails to train a global AI model efficiently. Accordingly, privacy-preserving distributed and collaborative machine learning, particularly federated learning (FL), is a desideratum. As it is already prevalent in the healthcare sector, questions remain regarding the effectiveness and efficacy of FL-based phishing detection within the context of multi-organization collaborations. To the best of our knowledge, the work herein was the first to investigate the use of FL in phishing email detection. This study focused on building upon a deep neural network model, particularly recurrent convolutional neural network (RNN) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), for phishing email detection. We analyzed the FL-entangled learning performance in various settings, including (i) a balanced and asymmetrical data distribution among organizations and (ii) scalability. Our results corroborated the comparable performance statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for balanced datasets and low organizational counts. Moreover, we observed a variation in performance when increasing the organizational counts. For a fixed total email dataset, the global RNN-based model had a 1.8% accuracy decrease when the organizational counts were increased from 2 to 10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:s85pQhAUCrAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5810874543999371304", "cites_id": ["5810874543999371304"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KEhxRZxfpFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
