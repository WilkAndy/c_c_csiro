The unique feature of our model is that the trust value is derived from the social capital built in the social networks over a period of time. First, we introduce a framework for building trust communities using social trust. We then define an underlying social trust model, called STrust. Finally, we report the current state of the development and the analysis of the proposed trust model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5647296586782026925", "cites_id": ["5647296586782026925"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6120905/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rSxrNFM6X04J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 15, "2018": 18, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
