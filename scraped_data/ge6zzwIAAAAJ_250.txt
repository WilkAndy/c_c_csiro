Driven by the distributed nature of medical data, the collaboration of multiple healthcare institutions is usually necessary for a sound medical conclusion. Among others, a typical use case is disease screening for public health, where multiple healthcare institutions wish to collaboratively detect over their joint datasets the patients whose medical records have similar features to the given query samples. However, sharing the medical data faces critical privacy obstacles with the increasingly strict legal regulations on data privacy. In this article, we present the design of a novel system enabling privacy-preserving DTW-based analytics on distributed medical time series datasets. Our system is built from a delicate synergy of techniques from both cryptography and data mining domains, where the key idea is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11923885806467837624", "cites_id": ["11923885806467837624"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9247434/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uG7WLPcmeqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
