Virtualizing the TPM is a logical next step towards building trusted cloud environments and providing a virtual TPM to a virtual machine promises a continuation of trusted computing concepts. The association between a virtual TPM and a virtual machine is a critical concern. We show that a \"trusted'' virtualized platform may fall victim to a Goldeneye attack. In this work, we put forward a formal model for virtualization systems and trusted virtualized platforms. We pair this with a model for establishing trust in a virtualized platform following conventional reasoning over trusted computing systems. We show that if a Goldeneye attack is successful, it would allow a verifier to establish trust in an untrustworthy platform. We discuss attack vectors and possible solutions which would mitigate Goldeneye."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5505320842855703263", "cites_id": ["5505320842855703263"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3338511.3357347", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3-L3XCPUZkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
