It is feasible to estimate the similarity between user movement patterns according to such trajectories, which can be regarded as a potential social tie between users. There are two key research challenges associated with social tie discovery from trajectories: (1) trajectories contain users' accurate locations and releasing such data for social tie discovery raises serious privacy concerns; (2) trajectories are archived as discrete approximations of actual movement patterns using different sampling strategies and rates which are intrinsically heterogeneous. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Privacy-protected Social Tie Mining (P-STM) approach. It provides a new social tie discovery solution based on the similarity of calibrated trajectories incorporating three key \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16995484508641394250", "cites_id": ["16995484508641394250"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8818397/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Sn45Wx0X3OsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
