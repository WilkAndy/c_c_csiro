It indeed plays a valuable role in a variety of Twitter-based applications, including content recommendations, news summarization, market analysis, etc. Topic derivation methods are typically based on semantic features of tweet contents. Because tweets are short by nature, such methods suffer from data sparsity. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a topic derivation method that incorporates tweet text similarity and interactions measures. Besides the tweet contents, the approach takes into account several types of interactions amongst tweets: Tweets which mention the same people, replies and retweets. Topic derivation is done through a two-step matrix factorization process. We conducted a number of experiments on several Twitter datasets to reveal both the individual and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5493179094634485229", "cites_id": ["5493179094634485229"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7906613/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7VVKT0ixO0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
