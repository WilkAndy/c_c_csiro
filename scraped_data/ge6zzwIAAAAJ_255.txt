When using social media, organisations are often keen to maximise engagements from their target audiences, that is, create posts to which their audience will react by, for example, replying, retweeting or liking. In this paper, we investigate the factors that characterise the posts with which an audience engages. While other work has looked at such factors for Twitter posts at large, we account for the effect of the organisation type. We find that the type of organisation (e.g., financial vs. telecommunications) has an impact on the characteristics of the posts associated with audience engagement. This is important as it can provide guidance to organisations on content creation strategies to maximise engagement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12765991133591511541", "cites_id": ["12765991133591511541"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3041021.3054237", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9SGCg0zpKbEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
