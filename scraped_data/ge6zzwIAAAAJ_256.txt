Analytics of social media data helps to maximise its utility, and visualisation plays a significant role in the exploration of both big data and the results of the analysis on it. A large amount of big data from online communities (and other social networks) are typically visualised through their interactions (e.g., who interacts with whom) in the form of graphs where people are represented as nodes and the interactions between them as edges. But there is a lot of other information that could be analysed and visualised, such as annotations performed through crowd sourcing which has been very popular in recent time. How can one visualise the social network data from the prism of such annotations? This is what we address here.
