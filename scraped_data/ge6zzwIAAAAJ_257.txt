They try to meet new demands through rapid implementation of innovative and inclusive business models while at the same time lowering IT barriers. These demands call for a dynamic computing model that supports rapid innovation for services and their delivery. Cloud computing [1],[2],[3], which can be an important component of such a model, is a recent advance wherein IT-related functionalities (eg, CPU, applications, storage, network, etc.) are provided \u201cas a service\u201d to end-users under a usage-based payment model. In a Cloud computing model, end-users (such as SMEs, governments, and universities) can leverage virtualized application services probably on the fly based on fluctuating requirements and, in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1543883326648639681", "cites_id": ["1543883326648639681"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13000216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wWCKq7T5bBUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
