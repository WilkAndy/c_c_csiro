While most Cloud service providers promise some Quality of Service (QoS) through a Service Level Agreement (SLA), it is very hard for Cloud clients to know what impacts these QoS have on their businesses. In this paper, we study this issue by conducting a simple performance evaluation of two public Clouds. We selected TPC-C to benchmark three types of instances (Small, Medium and Large) provided by the Cloud providers in order to find out how the typical online transaction process systems perform on the cloud nodes. Our testing results show that the different Cloud environments deliver very different performance landscapes with different Cloud instances. Our work demonstrates the importance and opportunity to choose the appropriate Cloud instance in achieving an optimal cost \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1189653301177875265", "cites_id": ["1189653301177875265"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37804-1_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QfuT1l9_ghAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
