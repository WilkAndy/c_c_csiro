One of the main sources of inconsistency is the non-conformance between business processes and their external behaviors, expressed through service contracts. Today, the onus is on the programmers to write complex code to handle such non-conformance due to shortcomings in supporting tools and technologies. This paper addresses this problem in the context of consistency requirements, firstly, by describing the relationships between the business process workflow and Web service contracts, and then by providing a prototype tool that checks the conformance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2363591600290521296", "cites_id": ["2363591600290521296"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1615041/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0OBpoQkqzSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
