However, ransomware attacks and their spread on hospital infrastructures, including ICE, are rising. Often the adversaries are targeting multiple hospitals with the same ransomware attacks. These attacks are detected by using machine learning algorithms. But the challenge is devising the anti-ransomware learning mechanisms and services under the following conditions: (1) provide immunity to other hospitals if one of them got the attack, (2) hospitals are usually distributed over geographical locations, and (3) direct data sharing is avoided due to privacy concerns. In this regard, this paper presents a federated distributed integrated clinical environment, aka. FedDICE. FedDICE integrates federated learning (FL), which is privacy-preserving learning, to SDN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2887692024281150521", "cites_id": ["2887692024281150521"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-91424-0_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ObQBsJgkEygJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
