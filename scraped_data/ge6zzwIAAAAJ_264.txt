Self-improvement in autonomic systems refers to the improvement of their self-* capabilities, so that they are able to (a) better handle previously known (anticipated) situations, and (b) deal with previously unknown (unanticipated) situations. In this position paper, we present a vision of using self-improvement through learning to achieve antifragility in autonomic cyber defence systems. We first enumerate some of the major challenges associated with realizing distributed self-improvement. We then propose a reference model for middleware frameworks for self-improving autonomic systems and a set of desirable features of such frameworks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1114844253818556081", "cites_id": ["1114844253818556081"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8831220/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sY69MPG4eA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
