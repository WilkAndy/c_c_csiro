Existing methods focus mainly on conversational settings, where dialogic features are used for (dis)agreement inference. We extend this scope and seek to detect stance (dis)agreement in a broader setting, where independent stance-bearing utterances, which prevail in many stance corpora and real-world scenarios, are compared. To cope with such non-dialogic utterances, we find that the reasons uttered to back up a specific stance can help predict stance (dis)agreements. We propose a reason comparing network (RCN) to leverage reason information for stance comparison. Empirical results on a well-known stance corpus show that our method can discover useful reason information, enabling it to outperform several baselines in stance (dis)agreement detection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10470285574602742224", "cites_id": ["10470285574602742224"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01392", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0NkXk0HtTZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
