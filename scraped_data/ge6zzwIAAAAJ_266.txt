Lack of interpretability and interoperability among security systems are considered the key challenges to fully leverage the potential of the collective capabilities of different security systems. The processes of integrating security systems are repetitive, time-consuming and error-prone; these processes are carried out manually by human experts or using ad-hoc methods. To help automate security systems integration processes, we propose an Ontology-driven approach for Security OrchestrAtion Platform (OnSOAP). The developed solution enables interpretability, and interoperability among security systems, which may exist in operational silos. We demonstrate OnSOAP's support for automated integration of security \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11703582232804345019", "cites_id": ["11703582232804345019"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8812856/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u0TgUQh6a6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
