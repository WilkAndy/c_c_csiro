The uncertainties surrounding the 3Vs of streaming data - variety, velocity and volume - impose dynamic QoS-driven resource requirements on each component (or service) of the pipeline and make adaptive resource management a complex task. Our overall research objective is to develop appropriate resource scaling strategies that dynamically adjust the resources allocated to each component in the pipeline so as to ensure end-to-end QoS fulfillment while optimizing the associated costs. To this end, in this paper, we present our work in progress on a model for end-to-end QoS and cost-aware resource allocation for IoT data processing pipelines. We base our model on the well-established unbounded knapsack problem, which offers a simple yet powerful abstraction of constraint-based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12873895737734977554", "cites_id": ["12873895737734977554"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8456436/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Etgb8_ZDqbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
