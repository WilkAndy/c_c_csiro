To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel resource scaling approach that exploits both resource and contract heterogeneity to achieve optimal resource allocations and better cost control. We model resource allocation as an Unbounded Knapsack Problem, and resource scaling as an one-step ahead resource allocation problem. Based on this, we present two scaling strategies, namely delta scale optimization and full scale optimization. Delta scale optimization supports the traditional notion of scaling resources horizontally, i.e., it computes an optimal allocation (or deallocation) of resources to increase (or decrease) the total compute capacity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5316339572573252120", "cites_id": ["5316339572573252120"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8411019/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GKqUkKxux0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
