As a result, there is a lot of interest in monitoring Twitter and understanding the topics of conversations. However, the fact that tweets are short in content makes topics derivation a challenge, as most existing methods use content features only, sometimes integrated with limited interaction information. In this paper, we propose a novel method: Non-negative Matrix inter-joint Factorization (NMijF), in which we conduct co-factorization jointly over Twitter interaction features and content attributes within a single iterative-update process. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on real Twitter datasets and evaluated the performance of the proposed method, especially comparing it with the Joint Non-negative Matrix Factorization (joint-NMF) and Non-negative Matrix co \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14435740437244705238", "cites_id": ["14435740437244705238"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7207205/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1nm2n3ENVsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
