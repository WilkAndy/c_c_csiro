The challenge is how to ensure data confidentiality and integrity when storing such data but still make it highly available, process it to extract actionable information for decision makers, including medical professionals, and share it with collaborators, while preserving the privacy of individual patients and giving them the full control of their data at all times. This challenge calls for a trustworthy big data processing platform."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2269343221507742207", "cites_id": ["2269343221507742207"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7116439/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_9lo76JTfh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 15, "2017": 14, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 15, "2021": 18, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
