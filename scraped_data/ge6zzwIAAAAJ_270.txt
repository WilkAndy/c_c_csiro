Data volumes, device connectivity, computing power, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, online communication and the overall penetration of digital technologies are increasing at an accelerating rate. In recent times autonomous (robotic) systems capable of replicating manual and cognitive human tasks have made major capability leaps within the areas of customer service, medical diagnostics, transportation, agriculture, mining and defence.The exponential growth of digital technology creates the possibility of a future very different from the world of today. When digital technology is combined with the drivers of globalisation, demographic change and cultural change, the operating context for business, government and community organisations is likely to be reshaped. Examining trends, generating plausible scenarios and designing resilient strategies can help decision makers chart a pathway towards a better future for their organisations and for society."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6988723634842456474", "cites_id": ["6988723634842456474"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lachlan-Rudd/publication/312470278_Fast_Forward_the_digital_marketplace_for_government_services/links/587dc18408ae9a860ff1501a/Fast-Forward-the-digital-marketplace-for-government-services.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mlEpOB7v_GAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1}}
