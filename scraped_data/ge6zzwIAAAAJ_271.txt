Drawing from this success, we are exploring the use of an online community to build a support group for parents currently in receipt of income support but needing to transition to find a job. Complementing the financial and informational support offered through existing welfare transition programs, our work aims to help people improve their prospect of finding a job to become financially self-sufficient and develop a support network to help them in their transition back to work. In this paper, we present the design of a journey of reflection and collaboration to encourage reflective thinking and foster relationships between community members."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14088354273758663276", "cites_id": ["14088354273758663276"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2441776.2441830", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bNI9lZHjg8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
