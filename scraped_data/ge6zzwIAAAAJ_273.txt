As such this paper presents a virtual storage services architecture that utilises a Simple Distributed Storage Interface for virtualisation of different physical storage technologies and capabilities into a pool of logical storage for collaboration data. An e-health case study, with implementation and performance evaluation, shows the storage interface and architecture within the context of a Secure Storage Service, a key management service and a global backup service. The performance evaluation uses various experimental configurations and several commonly used data transport protocols."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5026905610441185371", "cites_id": ["5026905610441185371"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJAHUC.2009.0239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W9jD3QQow0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
