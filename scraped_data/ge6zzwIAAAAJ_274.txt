These resources include data, application, software, tools as well as infrastructures, and are typically subject to a rich set of access policies. The automated instantiation of a collaboration using such resources including their interoperability is a difficult problem. Existing systems are either built for specific resources, or use manual and ad-hoc approaches. This problem has attracted the Web Services community, where Web Services standards such as WSLA and WS-CDL have been proposed to address similar problems. These approaches are designed to deal with scenarios involving two parties: a service provider and a service consumer. They do not scale well to multiparty nature of dynamic collaborations. This paper proposes a contract language for dynamic multiparty collaborations that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4577830419317108826", "cites_id": ["4577830419317108826"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03354-4_41", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WrBfEYO4hz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
