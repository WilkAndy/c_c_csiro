Our research is particularly interested in the type of collaboration where resources are normally 'opaque' and are only revealed 'as- required' between a select group of collaborating partners. Working in this area has revealed a need to establish a trusted environment for all application transactions prior-to, during and after a collaboration e.g. a pre-active eContract negotiation phase, an active phase for all collaborating activities and a post- active phase for information retrieval. Central to our embodiment of the trusted environment is the development and use of a portable trust extension device (TED) with applicability to each phase of the collaboration process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1046709070416295583", "cites_id": ["1046709070416295583"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4407196/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n7ZXlVqohg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
