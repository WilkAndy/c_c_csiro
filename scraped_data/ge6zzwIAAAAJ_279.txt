Modelling the generation of layouts has recently gained attention due to its importance in aesthetics and communication style. In contrast to standard prediction tasks, there are a range of acceptable layouts which depend on user preferences. For example, a poster designer may prefer logos on the top-left while another prefers logos on the bottom-right. Both are correct choices yet existing machine learning models treat layouts as a single choice prediction problem. In such situations, these models would simply average over all possible choices given the same input forming a degenerate sample. In the above example, this would form an unacceptable layout with a logo in the centre.In this paper, we present an auto-regressive neural network architecture, called LayoutMCL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1700517101631437559", "cites_id": ["1700517101631437559"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474085.3475525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9_o3UUtzmRcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
