The resulted propagation characteristics are therefore very different compared to mass infections and cannot be well captured by existing propagation models. In this paper, we take the first step to model social worm propagation for the APT using a novel proactive give-up factor, by which the worm can consult to actively postpone or stop unnecessary infections in order to keep the propagation stealthy (inversely in terms of the size of infected population) and long-term (in terms of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4867056466727541443", "cites_id": ["4867056466727541443"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404821001450", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wxoQ2RFCi0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
