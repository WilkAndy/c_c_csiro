This is significant for numerous domain applications, such as industrial inspection, medical imaging, and security enforcement. There are two key research challenges associated with existing anomaly detection approaches: (1) many approaches perform well on low-dimensional problems however the performance on high-dimensional instances, such as images, is limited; (2) many approaches often rely on traditional supervised approaches and manual engineering of features, while the topic has not been fully explored yet using modern deep learning approaches, even when the well-label samples are limited. In this paper, we propose a One-for-all Image Anomaly Detection system (OIAD) based on disentangled learning using only clean samples. Our key insight is that the impact of small \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10989699212821957771", "cites_id": ["10989699212821957771"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9207434/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i4ykSDVBg5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
