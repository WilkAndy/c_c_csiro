Though there have been several recent works proposing access control schemes, they are not suitable for many large scale real-world applications where content is often organized in a hierarchical manner (such as movies in Netflix) for efficient service provision. This paper uses a cryptographic technique, referred to as Role-Based Encryption, to introduce inheritance property for achieving access control over hierarchical contents. The proposed scheme encrypts the hierarchical content in such a way that any consumer who pays a higher level of subscription and is able to access (decrypt) contents in the higher part of the hierarchy is also able to access (decrypt) the content in the lower part of the hierarchy using their decryption keys. Additionally, our scheme provides \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8324161524482030410", "cites_id": ["8324161524482030410"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-58951-6_28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Sru5n81chXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
