To improve the security awareness of users, recent automatic techniques produce security-centric descriptions by performing program analysis. However, the generated text does not always address users\u2019 concerns as they are generally too technical to be understood by ordinary users. Moreover, different users have varied linguistic preferences that do not match the text. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an innovative scheme to help users avoid malware and privacy-breaching apps by generating security descriptions that explain the privacy and security related aspects of an Android app in clear and understandable terms. We implement a prototype system, PERSCRIPTION, to generate personalised security-centric descriptions that automatically learn users\u2019 security concerns and linguistic preferences to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13313972374976567785", "cites_id": ["13313972374976567785"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3317699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6ZnXp1W7xLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
