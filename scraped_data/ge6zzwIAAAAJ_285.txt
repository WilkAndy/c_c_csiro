Inferring such places is significant for not only the precise advertising on the commercial aspect but the identifying rallies or meetings among a group of people and tracking of the target individuals on the aspect of public security, e.g., locating and tracking suspected terrorists for anti-terrorist work. However, it is a challenge to map from big location data to places of activity due to the volume and complexity whilst giving rise to privacy concerns, e.g., personally important place mining. In the paper, a method for POA mining on big location data is proposed, named P-PAM, aiming at big data analytics and privacy concerns.
