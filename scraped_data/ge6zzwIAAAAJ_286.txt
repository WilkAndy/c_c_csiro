Understanding the movement of people and their spatial trajectories would greatly aid the development of policies for sustainable urban living including urban traffic analysis and smart city management. Due to the widespread popularity of mobile devices with location-aware capabilities and the extensive prevalence of location-based social networks, citizens' movements and their trajectories are being produced and gathered at an unprecedented rate. In this context, there are two fundamental issues that need to be addressed: trajectory data hold private information of citizens that require privacy preserving solutions for data release and analysis, and the heterogeneous nature of the trajectory data makes it hard to effectively measure their similarity, which is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2767169222136628804", "cites_id": ["2767169222136628804"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7870912/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RAbZFr_1ZiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
