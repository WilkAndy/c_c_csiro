The idea behind these services is that they would be fully automated, but feel personalised to the users. We argue in this paper that, sometimes, and in particular for some groups of citizens, the\u2015human touch\u2016 is important\u2013ie, having a human interface with the citizens. We further argue that this is now possible with social media, which affords one-to-many interactions. We draw examples from a preliminary study of the discussion forum in a one year trial of an online community developed to support welfare recipients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13403978929108930221", "cites_id": ["13403978929108930221"], "pub_url": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-997/pegov2013_paper_3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rc5bltF_BLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
