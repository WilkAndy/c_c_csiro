These models largely ignore the interactions of friends with their friends, referred to as \u201cfriendship effects\u201d. Results from social studies and behavioural science show that friends have a significant influence on the behaviour of the members in the community. Following the famous Spanish proverb on friendship \u201cTell Me Your Friends and I Will Tell You Who You Are\u201d, we extend our behaviour based trust model by incorporating the \u201cfriendship effect\u201d. In this paper, we present a trust propagation model based on associations which combines the behaviour of both individual members and their friends. The propagation of trust in our model depends on three key factors: the density of interactions, the degree of separation and the decay of friendship effect. We evaluate our model using a real dataset and make observations on what happens in a social network with models with and without trust propagation. We report the results in this paper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14877307370220208081", "cites_id": ["14877307370220208081"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c68c5c969b7a6e32584ddc44ba0fca398c310f66", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0b9G2DrQds4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 1}}
