This paper examines this problem, and proposes a set of solutions by first defining ways of specifying compatibility conditions on contracts using standards such as WS-business activity and then presenting a tool that enables application developers check those conditions at design time"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2630459960895517860", "cites_id": ["2630459960895517860"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4026901/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pLQQzWVFgSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
