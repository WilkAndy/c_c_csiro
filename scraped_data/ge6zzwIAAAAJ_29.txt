As a result, Cloud service identification and discovery remains a hard problem due to different service descriptions, non-standardised naming conventions and heterogeneous types and features of Cloud services. In this paper, we present an OWL-based ontology, the Cloud Computing Ontology (CoCoOn) that defines functional and non-functional concepts, attributes and relations of infrastructure services. We also present a system, CloudRecommender-that implements our domain ontology in a relational model. The system uses regular expressions and SQL for matching user requests to service descriptions. We briefly describe the architecture of the CloudRecommender system, and demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability through a service configuration selection experiment based on a set of prominent Cloud \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3896599641495042294", "cites_id": ["3896599641495042294"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6450944/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9vg5l7qAEzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 12, "2015": 14, "2016": 13, "2017": 23, "2018": 10, "2019": 15, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
