To address this issue, it is necessary to ensure that a sender can trust the receiver and its environment to correctly implement its policy and vice versa, while sharing electronic patient records. This paper proposes an approach that can be used to establish a trust between two interacting parties based on trusted computing technologies, and describes its application and implementation in the context of distributed healthcare systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16110632830189553562", "cites_id": ["16110632830189553562"], "pub_url": "https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/24006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mscxhjN3lN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 3}}
