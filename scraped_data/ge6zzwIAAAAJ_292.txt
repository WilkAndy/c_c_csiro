Due to the lack of knowledge, many zero-day families\u2019 malware may remain undetected until the classifier gains specialized knowledge. The most existing ML-based methods will take a long time to learn new malware families in the latest malware family landscape. Existing ML-based Android malware detection and classification methods struggle with the fast evolution of the malware landscape, particularly in terms of the emergence of zero-day malware families and limited representation of single-view features. In this article, a new multiview feature intelligence (MFI) framework is developed to learn the representation of a targeted capability from known malware families for recognizing unknown and evolving malware with the same capability. The new framework \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:7Frjd3zlGBUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12012721374884246629", "cites_id": ["12012721374884246629"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9764650/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZbS3v3HCtaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
