This data has been published in disparate sources including news articles, blogs, white papers and social media but not in a centralised form. In addition, while comprehensive vulnerability databases do exist, a significant portion of their listings may not apply to IoT devices since these devices tend to run on unique software, hardware and networking protocols. We present the design and implementation of a community-driven, IoT-specific database which documents the vulnerabilities and attacks on IoT infrastructures. Our database supports the integration with other vulnerability databases such as National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and provides a suite of data access APIs for integration with other applications, such as Integrated Development Environment (IDE \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18173523517479093094", "cites_id": ["18173523517479093094"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-4706-9_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZoOMCFpTNfwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
