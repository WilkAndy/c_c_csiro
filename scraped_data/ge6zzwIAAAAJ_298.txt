Anonymous web browsing refers to utilization of the World Wide Web that hides a user's personally identifiable information from the websites visited. Even if a user can hide the IP address and other physical information with anonymity programs such as Tor, the web server can always monitor the user on the basis of the identity. In this paper, we firstly give an overview and cryptanalysis on the protocol of Yang et al and point out the security weaknesses of their protocol. Then, we propose a new authentication protocol for anonymous web browsing. In the proposed protocol, we take the advantages of a pseudo identity mechanism and an identity\u2010based elliptic curve cryptography algorithm to achieve user anonymity, robust security, and high efficiency.
