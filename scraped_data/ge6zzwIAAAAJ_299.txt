This paper presents findings on the influence of seasonal variation on the results of a recently completed national trial of home telemonitoring of patients with chronic conditions, carried out at five locations along the east coast of Australia.Objective: The aim is to evaluate the effect of the seasonal timing of hospital admission and length of stay on clinical outcome of a home telemonitoring trial involving patients (age: mean 72.2, SD 9.4 years) with chronic conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease coronary artery disease, hypertensive diseases, congestive heart failure, diabetes, or asthma) and to explore methods of minimizing the influence of seasonal variations in the analysis of the effect of at-home telemonitoring on the number of hospital admissions and length of stay (LOS).Methods: Patients were selected from a hospital list of eligible patients living with a range of chronic conditions. Each test patient was case matched with at least one control patient. A total of 114 test patients and 173 control patients were available in this trial. However, of the 287 patients, we only considered patients who had one or more admissions in the years from 2010 to 2012. Three different groups were analyzed separately because of substantially different climates:(1) Queensland,(2) Australian Capital Territory and Victoria, and (3) Tasmania. Time series data were analyzed using linear regression for a period of 3 years before the intervention to obtain an average seasonal variation pattern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2314583260576024463", "cites_id": ["2314583260576024463"], "pub_url": "https://medinform.jmir.org/2018/1/e16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jwezWTYNHyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
