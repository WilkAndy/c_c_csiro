The realization of IoT systems will enable seamless integration of the cyber world with our physical world and will fundamentally change and empower human interaction with the world. A key technology in the realization of IoT systems is middleware, which is usually described as a software system designed to be the intermediary between IoT devices and applications. In this paper, we first motivate the need for an IoT middleware via an IoT application designed for real-time prediction of blood alcohol content using smartwatch sensor data. This is then followed by a survey on the capabilities of the existing IoT middleware. We further conduct a thorough analysis of the challenges and the enabling technologies in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 780, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17620082667794296284", "cites_id": ["17620082667794296284"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7582463/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3G3lxtQbh_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 44, "2018": 117, "2019": 149, "2020": 152, "2021": 152, "2022": 120, "2023": 35}}
