Many privacy-sensitive applications like health services are built on cloud for economic benefits and operational convenience. Usually, data sets in these applications are anonymized to ensure data owners\u02bc privacy, but the privacy requirements can be potentially violated when new data join over time. Most existing approaches address this problem via re-anonymizing all data sets from scratch after update or via anonymizing the new data incrementally according to the already anonymized data sets. However, privacy preservation over incremental data sets is still challenging in the context of cloud because most data sets are of huge volume and distributed across multiple storage nodes. Existing approaches suffer from poor scalability and inefficiency because \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11544384851846906118", "cites_id": ["11544384851846906118"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000012001766", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BkG8pNvkNaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 10, "2015": 11, "2016": 15, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 19, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
