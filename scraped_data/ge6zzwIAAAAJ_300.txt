RFID authentication is a primary approach to secure a RFID system and make it privacy-friendly. There are many RFID authentication protocols proposed to tackle the RFID security, privacy and efficiency concerns. However, with the increasingly stringent security and privacy requirements and limited computation capacity of tags, most of these protocols have suffered with serious security weaknesses and inefficient performance. In this paper, we firstly give an overview on Kaur et al.\u2019s protocol and point out the security deficiencies of their protocol. Then, we propose an improved lightweight anonymous authentication protocol for RFID systems using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5317823395091956839", "cites_id": ["5317823395091956839"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02922-7_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z8S36jO0zEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
