We usually monitor only a few users of detecting various risks due to the resource constraints and privacy protection. This leads to a critical problem to detect compromised users who are out of surveillance. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment method to address this problem. The aim is to assess the security status of unmonitored users according to the limited information collected from monitored users in networks. There are two innovative techniques developed: First, we identify the source of risk propagation by inversely disseminating risks from the influenced (by rumours) or infected (by viruses) monitored users. We show a new finding that the ones who synchronously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11103643070445310557", "cites_id": ["11103643070445310557"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7980204/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XdKe_ooQGJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
