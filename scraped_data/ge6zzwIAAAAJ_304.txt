Although Cloud computing was incepted with business computing needs in mind, it is increasingly being considered by scientific communities. In recent times, a number of science Clouds have been built for specific research communities. Many research communities use workflow environments and tools such as Taverna and Galaxy to model the execution of tasks to support and expedite the re-enactment of complex processes, and ultimately support the repeatability of science. As a result, a number of systems that integrate Clouds with these workflow systems have emerged including CloudMap, CloudMan, Galaxy Cloud, BioBlend. Whilst there has been many concerns about the capability of virtualized Cloud resources to meet the needs of scientific computation, recent results have shown that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10956441471291525934", "cites_id": ["10956441471291525934"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/59/3/285/2568593", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Louw6ncZDZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
