Some of the typical features found in the collaboration tools include video conferencing facility, images/documents exchange in real-time, and annotations to point and draw on shared rich media content. Though the innovations and conveniences of such collaboration tools are well understood, security implications of such systems are often overlooked. As a result, necessary security mechanisms are not supported by them. This can lead to serious security threats and privacy violations. In this paper, we first present a collaboration tool which was developed to facilitate the collaborations among health care providers using pervasive mobile devices for delivering health services to remote and regional areas.
