This brings in a requirement of (a) way to describe the content as well as the environment such as device and network in which it is to be delivered, and (b) a method to adapt the content for the environment and the application. Maximizing user viewing experiences and minimizing resources required is the main aim of the adaptation process. This involves identifying relevant segments within a video and scaling down the video in different dimensions so that it can be delivered to the end users any time any where on any device. Towards this we have developed a prototype system for delivery of adaptive video (DAVE). In this paper, we explain how DAVE delivers video \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12118710856111502829", "cites_id": ["12118710856111502829"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1220906/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7TUy4lBPLqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 4}}
