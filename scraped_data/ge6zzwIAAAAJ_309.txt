This International Standard was developed in response to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications such as videoconferencing, digital storage media, television broadcasting, internet streaming, and communication. It is also designed to enable the use of the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network environments. In some real time application of DVB-H system needs like live TV, video telephony, live news or live sports, which require lower encoding time. In non real time applications like Video on Demand requires lower memory requirement and higher video quality. This paper describes the three variant and simulation of H. 264 video codec: one original encoder, second encoder provide lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12318777567712859812", "cites_id": ["12318777567712859812"], "pub_url": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icme/2001/11980285/12OmNrNh0Rm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pFaTHu4W9aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
