Cloud computing provides a promising platform to support the addressing of this challenge as it provides a flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable manner at low cost. Some techniques have been developed in recent years for processing sensor data on cloud, such as sensor-cloud. However, these techniques do not provide efficient support on fast detection and locating of errors in big sensor data sets. For fast data error detection in big sensor data sets, in this paper, we develop a novel data error detection approach which exploits the full computation potential of cloud platform and the network feature of WSN.
