However, they could be bypassed by stronger adversarial attacks and are limited in their ability to handle high-fidelity images. In this paper, we explore an effective detection-based defense against adversarial attacks on images (including high-resolution images) by extending the investigation beyond a single-instance perspective to incorporate its transformations as well. Our intuition is that the essential characteristics of a valid image are generally not affected by non-essential style transformations, for example, a slight variation in the facial expression of a portrait would not alter its identification. In contrast, adversarial examples are designed to affect only a single instance at a time, with unpredictable effects on a set of transformations of the instance. Consequently, we leverage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:DXE8ND7PrJAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12523620980915993131", "cites_id": ["12523620980915993131"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9724182/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K3og3e3WzK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
