In order to ensure the security and privacy of patients\u2019 sensitive biomedical data and the efficiency of message processing across different devices, it is critical to provide a secure and lightweight authentication scheme for WBANs. In this article, we propose an extra lightweight authentication scheme for mobile-edge computing-enabled WBANs. Two different authentication phases based on the modular square roots technique are designed: one is the intra-BAN authentication between the sensor node and edge node (EN), and the other is the inter-BAN authentication between EN and application provider. The proposed scheme offers robust security by providing comprehensive security analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18047254786108775815", "cites_id": ["18047254786108775815"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9663536/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h137CJy6dPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
