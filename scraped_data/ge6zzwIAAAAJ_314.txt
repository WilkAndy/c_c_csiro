Such documents may contain sensitive information and releasing them openly may lead to the leakage of confidential information. Detection of sentences that contain sensitive information in documents can help organisations prevent the leakage of valuable confidential information. This is especially challenging when such sentences contain a substantial amount of information or are paraphrased versions of known sensitive content. Current approaches to sensitive information detection in such complex settings are based on keyword-based approaches or standard machine learning models. In this paper, we wish to explore whether pretrained transformer models are well suited to detect complex sensitive information. Pretrained transformers are typically trained on an enormous amount of text \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:orDZ08hpP44C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15010708215657546302", "cites_id": ["15010708215657546302"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9750249/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PkJOjZe_UNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
