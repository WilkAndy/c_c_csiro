Hence, the process of generating PRNs is the most critical step in the OTP authentication. An improper implementation of the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) will result in predictable or even static OTP values, making them vulnerable to potential attacks. In this paper, we present a vulnerability study against PRNGs implemented for Android apps. A key challenge is that PRNGs are typically implemented on the server-side, and thus the source code is not accessible. To resolve this issue, we build an analysis tool, OTP-Lint, to assess implementations of the PRNGs in an automated manner without the source code requirement. Through reverse engineering, OTP-Lint identifies the apps using SMS OTP and triggers each app's login functionality to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:s9ia6_kGH2AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14201858516311935673", "cites_id": ["14201858516311935673"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9402042/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uQohbxMjF8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
