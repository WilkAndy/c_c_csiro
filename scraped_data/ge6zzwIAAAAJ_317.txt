Unfortunately, since the data clone services need to manipulate sensitive information protected by the Android system, vulnerabilities in the design or implementation of these services may result in data privacy breaches. In this paper we present an empirical security analysis of eight widely used Wi-Fi hotspot-based data clone services deployed to millions of Android phones. Our study evaluates those services with respect to data export/import, data transmission, and Wi-Fi configuration with respect to security requirements that the data clone procedure should satisfy. Since data clone services are closed source, we design Poirot, an analysis system to recover workflows of the data clone services and detect potential flaws.
