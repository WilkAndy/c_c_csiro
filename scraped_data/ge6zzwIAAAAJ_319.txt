Traditional approaches tend to use homogeneous resources and horizontal scaling to handle workload fluctuations and do not leverage resource and contract heterogeneity to optimize cloud costs. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic resource scaling approach that exploits both resource and contract heterogeneity to achieve cost-effective resource allocations. We model resource allocation as an  unbounded knapsack problem , and resource scaling as an  one-step ahead resource allocation problem . Based on these models, we propose two scaling strategies: (a)  delta capacity optimization , which focuses on optimizing costs for the difference between existing resource allocation and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2815987680442570993", "cites_id": ["2815987680442570993"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8678427/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8dinKOBlFCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
