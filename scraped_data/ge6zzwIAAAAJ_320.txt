Ciphertext delegation is an important technique to deal with dynamic credentials, which enable users to be joined and revoked at any time while the system is operating. The delegation of CD-CP-ABE allows third parties such as cloud or proxy servers to convert a ciphertext to the other one with a more restrictive policy. Therefore, it can be used to revoke users dynamically in an access control system. Prior to our work, a delegation algorithm of CD-CP-ABE is not generic and the completeness of the delegation is shown when the size of the delegated access structure increases quadratically with the sizes of original and revocation access structures. In this paper, we provide a generic delegation algorithm to reform CP-ABE to CD-CP-ABE.
