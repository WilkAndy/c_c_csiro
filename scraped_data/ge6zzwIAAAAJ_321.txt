Dentistry has also been impacted by dental patients' reviews. This paper classifies trust-related information for dental care recommendations onto 4 categories: context, relationship, reputation and subjective criteria. It discusses each category and describes how they help focussing on trust when matching patients and dentists in brief. The paper then focuses on subjective criteria and presents the results of a survey aimed at showing trustrelated information emerged from subjective characteristics. Traits of personalities are used as subjective characteristics of patients and that of dentists are derived from the online patients' reviews. 580 Australian patients were surveyed to determine what factors affect their decision to find the trusted dentist. Subjective characteristics of dentists such as dentists' qualities and experienced dentists are considered the most important factors after location and cost. The most preferred dentists' qualities by almost all types of personalities are experienced, professional and quality of service. When the patients are further classified based on levels of fear, their preferences for dentists' qualities changed. Subjective qualities of both patients and dentists are important factors to improve the matching capability for the dental care recommendation systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9583769783774877629", "cites_id": ["9583769783774877629"], "pub_url": "https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/37421", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vRcGY9djAIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
