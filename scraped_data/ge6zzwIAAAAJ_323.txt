Current methods for querying streaming XML big data are mostly based on events filtering techniques. It is well known that during the filtering, some data items have to be buffered before the filter can make the proper decision for adopting strategies to deal with them. Furthermore, for a single filter system, the buffer size often increases exponentially in the real application. Cloud is an ideal platform for big XML data processing with its massive storage and powerful computation capability. In this paper, we propose a new multi-filters strategy for querying streaming XML big data on Cloud. We show that the proposed multi-filters strategy can effectively share and reduce the filtering space and time consumption by fully exploit the scalability of Cloud. Furthermore, by deploying our multi-filters collaboration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13738338343096530878", "cites_id": ["13738338343096530878"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6755344/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vrdlKO9hqL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3}}
