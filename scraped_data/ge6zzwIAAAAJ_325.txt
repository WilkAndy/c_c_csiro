Given its innovative nature and reliance on the Internet, the cloud inherently comes with a number of vulnerabilities that increase the space for cyber attacks. This paper aims to provide an overview of major potential risks to privacy and security in the cloud. Various emerging threats and attack methods are discussed, and some speculative future research directions are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10540190021040920446", "cites_id": ["10540190021040920446"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.775935377654437", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ftdC1fpGRpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
