Hence, the TPM functionality is available for applications that do not have physical TPMs in their local platforms. Moreover, the TPM cloud allows users to access their keys and data in the same virtual TPM even if they move to untrusted platforms. The TPM cloud is easy to access for applications in different languages since cloud computing delivers services in standard protocols. The functionality of the TPM cloud is demonstrated by applying it to implement the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol for web authentications, such that the strong security provided by TPMs is integrated into high level applications. The chain of trust based on the TPM cloud is discussed and the security properties of the virtual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17388810477091844820", "cites_id": ["17388810477091844820"], "pub_url": "https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e95-d_6_1577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1HKmwf92UfEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
