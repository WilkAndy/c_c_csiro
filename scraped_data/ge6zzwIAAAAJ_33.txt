However, the security and the privacy of the outsourced data goes beyond the data owners' control. In this paper, we propose a service composition approach to preserve privacy for data stored in untrusted storage service. A virtual file system, called Trust Store, is prototyped to demonstrate this concept. It allows users utilize untrusted storage service provider with confidentiality and integrity of the data preserved. We deployed the prototype with Amazon S3 and evaluate its performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9732179519209028263", "cites_id": ["9732179519209028263"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5493417/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pzrJnLWlD4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 13, "2015": 17, "2016": 16, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
