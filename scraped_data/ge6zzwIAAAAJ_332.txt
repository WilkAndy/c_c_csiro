We encountered this problem in our implementation of a prototype CBIR system, called CHITRA. This system supports four layer image data model and enable high level concept definition such as SUNSET. Users can pose queries of the form retrieve all images that have SUNSET and MOUNTAINS. We are addressing the problem of processing queries of the form retrieve all images similar to I1, I2,..., In based on color. We refer to such queries as SF-QBME. Essentially the same problem is encountered in processing high level concept queries such as SUNSET and MOUNTAINS above. Processing of such queries has received some recent research attention. Processing SF-QBME queries involves dealing with multiple points in a single feature space.
