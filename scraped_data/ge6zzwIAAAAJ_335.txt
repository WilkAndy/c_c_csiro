However, the use of fingerprints in security functions is challenged by the small, but unpredictable variations in fingerprint reproductions from the same device due to measurement noise. Our study formulates a novel and pragmatic approach to achieve highly reliable fingerprints from device memories. We investigate the transformation of raw fingerprints into a noise-tolerant space where the generation of fingerprints is intrinsically highly reliable. We derive formal performance bounds to support practitioners to easily adopt our methods for applications. Subsequently, we demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to investigate the practicability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:jmjb1lOE9QIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12328118934438661344", "cites_id": ["12328118934438661344"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9950309/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4Mz7i9pGFqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
