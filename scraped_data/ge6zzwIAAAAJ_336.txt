Being a hardware vulnerability, rowhammer bypasses all the system memory protection, allowing adversaries to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data. Rowhammer attacks have shown to enable privilege escalation, sandbox escape, and cryptographic key disclosures. A key requirement of  all  existing rowhammer attacks is that an attacker must have access to at least part of an exploitable hammer row. We term such rowhammer attacks as Explicit Hammer. Recently, several proposals suggest leveraging the spatial proximity between the accessed hammer rows and the location of the victim rows for a defense against rowhammer. These all aim to deny the attacker's permission to access hammer rows near sensitive data, thus defeating explicit hammer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15630743398963456977", "cites_id": ["15630743398963456977"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9919335/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0at_Xk6O69gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
