However, large scale sharing of such data may reveal sensitive information about individuals. One of the emerging challenges is identity tracing attack that exploits correlations among genomic data to reveal the identity of DNA samples. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the adversary can narrow down the sample\u2019s identity by detecting his/her genetic relatives and quantify such privacy threat by employing a Shannon entropy-based measurement. For example, we exemplify that when the dataset size reaches 30% of the population, for any target from that population, the uncertainty of the target\u2019s identity is reduced to merely 2.3 bits of entropy (i.e., the identity is pinned down within 5 people). Direct application of existing approaches such as differential privacy (DP), secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) may not be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9120554817357856574", "cites_id": ["9120554817357856574"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9822964/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Pr8Xm0i4kn4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
