A key property of a honeyfile, enticement, is the extent to which the file can attract an intruder to interact with it. We introduce a novel metric, Topic Semantic Matching (TSM), which uses topic modelling to represent files in the repository and semantic matching in an embedding vector space to compare honeyfile text and topic words robustly. We also present a honeyfile corpus created with different Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. Experiments show that TSM is effective in inter-corpus comparisons and is a promising tool to measure the enticement of honeyfiles. TSM is the first measure to use NLP techniques to quantify the enticement of honeyfile content that compares the essential topical content of local contexts to honeyfiles and is robust to paraphrasing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8745386901283074001", "cites_id": ["8745386901283074001"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07580", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0e9UOg3bXXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
