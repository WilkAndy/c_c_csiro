For an online community to start and proceed on to a sustainable operation, it is important that members are encouraged to contribute positively and frequently. We decided to introduce gamification in an online community that we designed and developed with the Australian Government's Department of Human Services to support welfare recipients transitioning from one payment to another. We first defined a formal model of gamification and a gamification design process. In instantiating our model to the online community, we realised that our context applied a number of constraints on the gamification elements that could be introduced. In this paper, we outline the design and implementation of a gamification model for online communities \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=699303432177737301", "cites_id": ["699303432177737301"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218843014410020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VV4qOcRstAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 19, "2020": 10, "2021": 24, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
