However, the security of cloud storage is underestimated in current practice, which resulted in many large-scale data breaches. To change the status quo, this paper presents the design of ShieldDB, an encrypted document database. ShieldDB adapts the searchable encryption technique to preserve the search functionality over encrypted documents without having much impact on its scalability. However, merely realising such a theoretical primitive suffers from real-world threats, where a knowledgeable adversary can exploit the leakage (aka access pattern to the database) to break the claimed protection on data confidentiality. To address this challenge in practical deployment, ShieldDB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5286048834142240084", "cites_id": ["5286048834142240084"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9609629/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VH1qcGjRW0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
