The in-network cache, one of the important characteristics, makes data packets to be available from multiple locations on the Internet. Hence data access control and their enforcement mechanisms become even more critical in the NDNs. In this paper, we propose a novel encryption-based data access control scheme using Role-Based Encryption (RBE). The inheritance property of our scheme provides a natural way to achieve efficient data access control over hierarchical content. This in turn makes our scheme suitable for large scale real world content-centric applications and services such as Netflix. Further, the proposed scheme introduces an anonymous signature-based authentication mechanism to reject bogus data requests nearer to the source, thereby preventing them from entering the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:AZju0d2GQJ0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8241697561254293471", "cites_id": ["8241697561254293471"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9603629/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3-_D_ENkYHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3}}
