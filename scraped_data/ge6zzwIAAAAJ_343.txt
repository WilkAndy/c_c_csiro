However, it is vulnerable to the newly revealed image-scaling attack. This work presents an image-scaling attack detection framework, Decamouflage, consisting of three independent detection methods: scaling, filtering, and steganalysis, to detect the attack through examining distinct image characteristics. Decamouflage has a pre-determined detection threshold that is generic. More precisely, as we have validated, the threshold determined from one dataset is also applicable to other different datasets. Extensive experiments show that Decamouflage achieves detection accuracy of 99.9% and 98.5% in the white-box and the black-box settings, respectively. We also measured its running time overhead on a PC with an Intel i5 CPU and 8GB RAM. The experimental results show that image \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6018125807044800166", "cites_id": ["6018125807044800166"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9505142/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pi6EPomthFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3}}
