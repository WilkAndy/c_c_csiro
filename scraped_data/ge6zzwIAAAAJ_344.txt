Searchable encryption is a common practice for outsourcing spatial data which enables search over encrypted data by sacrificing the full security via leaking some information about the queries to the server. However, these inherent leakages could equip the server to learn beyond what is considered in the scheme, in the worst-case allowing it to reconstruct of the database. Recently, a novel form of database reconstruction attack against such kind of outsourced spatial data was introduced (Markatou and Tamassia, IACR ePrint 2020/284), which is performed using common leakages of searchable encryption schemes, i.e., access and search pattern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QVtou7C4vgoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17091454419285459178", "cites_id": ["17091454419285459178"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88428-4_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6kBKbD0LMe0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3}}
