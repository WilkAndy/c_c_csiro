Their performance, in turn, depends upon several factors including (a) the amount of computing resources allocated to each service, (b) the configuration of each service, (c) the inter-dependencies between adjacent services, (d) the data ingestion rate, and (e) the specific tasks each service is assigned. This makes end-to-end quality-assured cloud resource allocation for DPPs a complex and challenging task. Our overall research objective is to develop mechanisms for dynamic resource allocation for services in a pipeline so as to ensure end-to-end QoS while optimizing the associated costs. To that end, in this paper, we propose a systematic approach for building a sustainable QoS model for constituent services, which can then be used to inform resource allocation decisions for the pipeline \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17646537273749267699", "cites_id": ["17646537273749267699"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8998479/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8-SDtScY5fQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3}}
