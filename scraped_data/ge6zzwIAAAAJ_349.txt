Containerization of applications allows fine-graded deployment and management of services and dependencies but also needs fine-graded security mechanisms. In this paper we provide formal abstractions for containerized systems by introducing LS^3, a formal model and logic with sub-domain constructs to represent stratified systems and their interactions. Using our formal model, we prove that the widely used Trusted Computing Group (TCG) based Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) securely extends trust measurements from boot to applications. However, IMA is not designed to make domain specific trust measurements and is consequently incapable of creating domain specific integrity reports. Current research aims to improve either trust measurement performance or comprehensiveness but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14896439635702914195", "cites_id": ["14896439635702914195"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8887372/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kxwfiOzIus4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
