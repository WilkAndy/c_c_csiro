Self-improvement in autonomic systems refers to the improvement of their self-\u2217 capabilities, so that they are able to (a) better handle previously known (anticipated) situations, and (b) deal with previously unknown (unanticipated) situations. In this position paper, we present a vision of using self-improvement through learning to achieve antifragility in autonomic cyber defence systems. We first enumerate some of the major challenges associated with realizing distributed self-improvement. We then propose a reference model for middleware frameworks for self-improving autonomic systems and a set of desirable features of such frameworks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:XDrR66g3YHsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13265237822026424587", "cites_id": ["13265237822026424587"], "pub_url": "https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/items/a73319ba-53de-4cc2-8e21-ccd6b61f21c9/1/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CyH2UoSXF7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
