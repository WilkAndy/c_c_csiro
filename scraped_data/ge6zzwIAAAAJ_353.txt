In previous work, we have developed the AWaRE approach for enabling cyber resilience via distributed, agent-oriented, constraint-based self-management. A key requirement and feature of AWaRE is the programmatic definition of constraint problems and their mapping to suitable coordination architectures in a way that supports run-time self-representation and self-organization. This can be satisfied via a domain-specific language (DSL); however, existing DSLs, e.g. for automated deployment and self-adaptivity, are not suitable for this purpose. In this paper, we present an expressive, Java-embedded DSL named ADSL that enables the design-time specification of system components, inter-component relationships and constraints, constraint problem decompositions, managing agent architectures, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15429420472017341082", "cites_id": ["15429420472017341082"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8587293/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:msq7tCtQINYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3}}
