Users\u2019 rating scores also vary, i.e., some users\u2019 scores are widely distributed while others are falling in a small range. Existing social recommendation approaches largely ignore such differences. We propose a peer-based relay recommendation method that exploits the credibility of users\u2019 ratings. The credibility of a user\u2019s rating is calculated according to its rating behaviour in terms of the number of ratings provided and the deviation from the normal behaviour. The credibility value of a user\u2019s rating is incorporated when aggregating ratings from different users. Experiments are conducted on a large-scale social rating network for movie recommendations. The results show that the incorporation of credibility of users\u2019 ratings can effectively reduce the impact of recommended rating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1407302137151788595", "cites_id": ["1407302137151788595"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68786-5_37", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M5aUaNa9hxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
