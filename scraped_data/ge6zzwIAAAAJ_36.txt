While dealing with big sensing data streams, a Data Stream Manager (DSM) must always verify the security (i.e. authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) to ensure end-to-end security and maintain data quality. Existing technologies are not suitable, because real time introduces delay in data stream. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Prime Number Based Security Verification (DPBSV) scheme for big data streams. Our scheme is based on a common shared key that updated dynamically by generating synchronized prime numbers. The common shared key updates at both ends, i.e., source sensing devices and DSM, without further communication after handshaking. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our DPBSV scheme show that it can significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13644146097720004463", "cites_id": ["13644146097720004463"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000016000209", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bw8iCpa-Wb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 23, "2017": 15, "2018": 7, "2019": 11, "2020": 19, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
