The important issue for video applications is to accommodate different ways in which a video sequence can function semantically. The authors propose and illustrate a metamodel framework that allows users to develop and specify their own semantics using automatically detected features and explicitly specifying objects, events and their relationships."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11367585476467330304", "cites_id": ["11367585476467330304"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/925391/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AI25RsPGwZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2}}
