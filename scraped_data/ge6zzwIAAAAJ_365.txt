However, sharing data in healthcare IoT raises many security and privacy concerns, such as how to ensure data integrity, source authentication, and data privacy. Redactable signature schemes (  s) could be a feasible solution to address this question because it allows a signature holder to independently delete the privacy-sensitive part of the authenticated data without invalidating the respective signature. This flexible data sharing mechanism not only protects data privacy but also saves bandwidth. However, the state-of-the-art   s suffer from either the costly public key management problem or the secret key escrow problem. Another drawback of these schemes lies in their computation and communication overheads and hence are quite expensive for constrained devices. To address these challenging issues \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:KTwcwpFFj4wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11722137228063681505", "cites_id": ["11722137228063681505"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9907881/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4Ssez7NlraIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
