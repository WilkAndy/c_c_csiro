In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a new system that allows highly efficient outsourcing of decision tree inference. Our system significantly improves upon prior art in the overall online end-to-end secure inference service latency at the cloud as well as the local-side performance of the model provider. We first present a new scheme which securely shifts most of the processing of the model provider to the cloud, resulting in a substantial reduction on the model provider's performance complexities. We further devise a scheme which substantially optimizes the performance for secure decision tree inference at the cloud, particularly the communication round complexities. The synergy of these techniques allows our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:naSTrk-c4S8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1129956761464642839", "cites_id": ["1129956761464642839"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9841036/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F52mErBprg8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
