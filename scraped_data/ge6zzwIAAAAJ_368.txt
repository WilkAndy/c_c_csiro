It is emerging as a promising approach to defending networks and systems against attackers and data thieves. However, despite being relatively cheap to deploy [1], the generation of realistic content at scale is very costly when it is hand-crafted. With recent improvements in Machine Learning, we now have the opportunity to bring scale and automation to the creation of realistic and enticing simulated content. In this work, we propose a framework to automate the generation of email and instant messaging-style group communications at scale. Such messaging platforms within organisations contain a lot of valuable information inside private communications and document attachments, making them an enticing target for an adversary. The presence of an active messaging platform also enhances the realism of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1159527714802186834", "cites_id": ["1159527714802186834"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9797379/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UjoBLFB4FxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
