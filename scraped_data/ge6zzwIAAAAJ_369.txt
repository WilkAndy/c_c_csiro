Deep attributed graph representation, utilizing deep learning models on the graph structure and attributes, shows its significance in mining complex relational data. Most existing deep attributed graph representation models assume graph attributes in a single-attributed view. However, rich information in real-world applications demands the ability to handle multiple attributed views. For example, in social network users\u2019 profiles and posts represent two distinct attributed views. A single-attributed view or a simple ensemble of them fails to represent the rich information and complex relations therein. To confront this challenge, this paper proposes a novel deep unsupervised graph representation learning model, called Multi-attributed-view graph Convolutional AutoEncoder (MagCAE). MagCAE learns the node-pairwise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3046898945579620898", "cites_id": ["3046898945579620898"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9782548/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IhrJpXLCSCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
