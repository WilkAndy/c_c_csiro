In this work, we explore the potential for generalizing classifiers between different targets, and propose a neural model that can apply what has been learned from a source target to a destination target. We show that our model can find useful information shared between relevant targets which improves generalization in certain scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=794163361074082054", "cites_id": ["794163361074082054"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06593", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BnFzhl5vBQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 15, "2021": 21, "2022": 32, "2023": 13}}
