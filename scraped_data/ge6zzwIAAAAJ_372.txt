Both individual customers and enterprise users (e.g., cloud providers) might refrain from using a computing system if it is vulnerable to rowhammer vulnerability. In this paper, we provide the first end-to-end tool, coined BitMine, that systematically assesses a DRAM chip\u2019s vulnerability to rowhammer bit flips. BitMine is an extension of DRAMDig. As DRAM address mappings are proprietary techniques and critical in inducing rowhammer bit flips, DRAMDig, our prior work, leverages domain knowledge to efficiently and deterministically reverse-engineer DRAM address mappings on Intel machines. By incorporating DRAMDig, BitMine configures three key parameters, i.e.,  hammer methods ,  hammer patterns ,  data patterns , on the effectiveness of finding rowhammer bit flips.
