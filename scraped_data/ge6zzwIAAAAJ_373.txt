However, their efficacy is threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection, eg, by performing feature-space manipulation. In this work, we propose an explainability-guided and model-agnostic framework for measuring the efficacy of malware detectors when confronted with adversarial attacks. The framework introduces the concept of Accrued Malicious Magnitude (AMM) to identify which malware features should be manipulated to maximize the likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several state-of-the-art malware detectors' ability to detect manipulated malware. We find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided manipulated samples;(ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using one detector to evade detection by another detector (ie \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10008348449358840402", "cites_id": ["10008348449358840402"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211110085S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
