While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts from this grey literature can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by creating the patterns of the security knowledge gained from different sources. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=637850900394606068", "cites_id": ["637850900394606068"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3483332", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9P2usQMa2ggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
