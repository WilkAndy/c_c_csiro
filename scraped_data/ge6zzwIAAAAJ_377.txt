However, image scaling functions could be adversarially abused to perform a newly revealed attack called image-scaling attack, which can affect a wide range of computer vision applications building upon image-scaling functions. This work presents an image-scaling attack detection framework, termed as Decamouflage. Decamouflage consists of three independent detection methods: (1) rescaling, (2) filtering/pooling, and (3) steganalysis. While each of these three methods is efficient standalone, they can work in an ensemble manner not only to improve the detection accuracy but also to harden potential adaptive attacks. Decamouflage has a pre-determined detection threshold that is generic. More precisely, as we have validated, the threshold determined from one dataset is also applicable to other different datasets. Extensive experiments show that Decamouflage achieves detection accuracy of 99.9\\% and 99.8\\% in the white-box (with the knowledge of attack algorithms) and the black-box (without the knowledge of attack algorithms) settings, respectively. To corroborate the efficiency of Decamouflage, we have also measured its run-time overhead on a personal PC with an i5 CPU and found that Decamouflage can detect image-scaling attacks in milliseconds. Overall, Decamouflage can accurately detect image scaling attacks in both white-box \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2301654015892832475", "cites_id": ["2301654015892832475"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:28Ak_SEe8R8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
