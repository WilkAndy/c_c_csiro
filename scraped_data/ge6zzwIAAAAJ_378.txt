Incorrect implementations of authentication make users' accounts vulnerable to several attacks such as eavesdropping attacks, reply attacks, and man-inthe- middle attacks, and thus break the first line of defense in securing mobile services. To solve this problem, we design a system that learns patterns from authentication bugs, and identifies incorrect authentication implementations from mobile applications. By conducting a static analysis, our system extracts control and data dependencies for further pattern learning and utilizes a machine learning algorithm to build a classification model. To distinguish whether an application contains any authentication bugs, we take the unknown application as an input and recognize the vulnerable patterns.
