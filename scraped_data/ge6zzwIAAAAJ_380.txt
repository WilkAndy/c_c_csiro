In CLAE, a configurable number of message bytes each is encrypted into a 2-byte ciphertext, which is defined over public nonces, messages, and secret keys, in a style similar to the samples in Learning with Errors (LWE) problem [3]. Such 2-byte ciphertexts look as if they are all randomly sampled (ie, similar to the decision problem in LWE) and form the basis of CLAE to randomize the ciphertexts. A 2-byte ciphertext contains 1-byte redundancy; if the ciphertext is changed or induced with faults, the decryption of the message byte will fail. In addition to the configurable number of message bytes, other message bytes each is encrypted into an 1-byte ciphertext, randomized directly or indirectly with the 2-byte ciphertexts and secret keys. In CLAE, the changes of nonces, messages, and associated data are propagated across the whole ciphertext; one bit change of them causes random changes of ciphertexts. On the other hand, if the ciphertext is tampered with, its decryption algorithm spreads the changes or faults to each 2-byte ciphertext, where changes or faults are detected. Without knowing the secret key, CLAE ensures the ciphertexts or associated data cannot be changed systematically to pass integrity check. In this submission, CLAE is specified at 128-bit security level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14688222540665933179", "cites_id": ["14688222540665933179"], "pub_url": "https://csrc.nist.rip/CSRC/media/Projects/Lightweight-Cryptography/documents/round-1/spec-doc/clae-spec.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e01HRpQM18sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2}}
