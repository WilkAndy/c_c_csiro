With the rapid growth in malware programs, categorical isolation of malware is no longer satisfactory for security risk management. It is more pragmatic to focus the limited resources on identifying the small fraction of malware programs of high security impact. In this paper, we define a new research issue of measuring and predicting the impact of the detected Android malware. To address this issue, we first propose two metrics to isolate the high impact Android malware programs from the low impact ones. With the proposed metrics, we created a new research dataset including high impact and low impact Android malware samples. The dataset allows us to empirically discover the driving factors for the high malware impact. To characterize the differences between high impact and low impact Android malware, we leverage features from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18438629627632706398", "cites_id": ["18438629627632706398"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05090-0_21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XmMKTPQr4_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2}}
