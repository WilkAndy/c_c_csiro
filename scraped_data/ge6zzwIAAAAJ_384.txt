They allow clients to scale their storage space to meet expanding requirements while improving its utilization and manageability. Given its innovative nature compared to the standard model of service provision, cloud computing raises new questions in terms of security, privacy and trust. There is a need to understand the risks associated with the cloud as well as build technologies 198to address those risks. This chapter aims to discuss these issues, and provide a possible solution in the context of a framework called TrustStore. We first define a service provisioning architecture based on the Virtual Network Operator (VNO) model, and then realize it by developing a Trust enhanced Secure cloud Storage Service (TS3) using both private and public cloud \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5971565811059584896", "cites_id": ["5971565811059584896"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/b11149-10/ts3-trust-enhanced-secure-cloud-storage-service-surya-nepal-shiping-chen-jinhui-yao", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gO8SaXdD31IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
