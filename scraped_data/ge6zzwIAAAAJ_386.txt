Currently, two complimentary Internet based research areas are emerging: social computing and cloud computing. On the one hand, social computing empowers individual users with relatively low technological sophistication to use the web to engage in social interactions, contribute their expertise and share their content, experiences and opinions. On the other hand, cloud computing offers everyone sophisticated computing infrastructures and resources as utilities, so that individual users with relatively low computing knowledge can have at their disposal a high performing computing infrastructure with little investment.
