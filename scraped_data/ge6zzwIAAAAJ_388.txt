These emerging Big Data applications present enterprises with very high data-to-compute ratio. For example, in Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope generates more data than the whole Internet with a single file often reaching multiple terabytes in size. As data volumes continue to increase exponentially, the challenge is not only how to store and manage data but also to effectively analyse the data to gain insight knowledge to make smarter decisions. One of the key challenges is transforming the raw data available to your business into business value and strategic advantage. The better management and analysis of Big Data will become the next frontier of innovation, competition and productivity.
