Proceedings 10", "pages": "566-573", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg", "abstract": "A successful execution of a Business Process (BP) is possible only if the proper coordination exists between (1) BP\u2019s execution policy, (2) BP\u2019s authorization policy, and (3) the authorization policies of BP\u2019s resources. Hence, there is a need of an effective authorization model that brings all types of policies together for a BP executing successfully without breaking any authorization and business rules. This paper proposes a Petri-Net process model, Process-Aware Service-Oriented Authorization Control Net (PASOAC-Net). PASOAC-Net is developed based on the conceptual model PASOAC, an extension of Role Based Access Control (RBAC), which takes both resources and users into account. A set of authorization constraints is designed in PASOAC to coordinate the user access and the resource support in a process environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1131395797106114790", "cites_id": ["1131395797106114790"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34321-6_41", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5kDhqnuGsw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
