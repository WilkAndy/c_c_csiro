In this paper, we present a smart user interface design for this emerging service-oriented web. The design leverages the advances of semantic web and service composition technologies to provide an intelligent and generic user interface to query, compose and execute web services for a variety of user tasks. First we develop a simple cost model for estimating the development and learning overheads of web service interfaces for service-oriented applications as the motivation of this work. Then, we present the design of the service-oriented browser and discuss the enabling technologies. A prototype system is developed using existing technologies and standards as proof of concept."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7162094730907785958", "cites_id": ["7162094730907785958"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24396-7_25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5pp0GzbfZGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
