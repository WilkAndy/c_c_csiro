This has created a requirement for a more specialized secure email system that supports more than just software-based data encryption for enterprises dealing with highly sensitive data. We present a proof-of-concept email application that utilizes hardware-based keys from trusted computing which are more resistant to direct platform exploitation. Through the demonstrator, we show that it is possible today to build a special-purpose trust- enhanced email application which also offers portability and mobility."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12589972575539761407", "cites_id": ["12589972575539761407"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5319186/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_xD1WFqRuK4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
