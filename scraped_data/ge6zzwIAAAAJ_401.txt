However, private verification approaches do not allow model users to verify the model at run-time. Instead, they must trust the service provider, who may tamper with the verification results. In contrast, a public verification approach that considers the possibility of dishonest service providers can benefit a wider range of users. In this paper, we propose PublicCheck, a practical public integrity verification solution for services of run-time deep models. PublicCheck considers dishonest service providers, and overcomes public verification challenges of being lightweight, providing anti-counterfeiting protection, and having fingerprinting samples that appear smooth. To capture and fingerprint the inherent prediction behaviors of a run-time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:lbI08cpqPnQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=542986824055555071", "cites_id": ["542986824055555071"], "pub_url": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2023/933600b239/1Js0DMl0xTq", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_4OMvaMTiQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
