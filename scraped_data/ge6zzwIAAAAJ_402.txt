To reduce communication bandwidth and provide a desired level of security, a data stream is first compressed to squeeze out redundant bits and then encrypted using authenticated encryption. This generic solution is very flexible and works well for any pair of (compression, encryption) algorithms. Its downside, however, is the fact that the two algorithms are designed independently. One would expect that designing a single algorithm that compresses and encrypts (called compcrypt) should produce benefits in terms of efficiency and security. The work investigates how to design a compcrypt algorithm using the ANS entropy coding. First, we examine basic properties of ANS and show that a plain ANS with a hidden encoding table can be broken by statistical attacks. Next, we study ANS behavior when its states are chosen at random.
