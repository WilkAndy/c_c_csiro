How to ensure both verifiability and privacy of the shared data is a vital issue. Most existing privacy-preserving authentication schemes greatly hinder the flexibility of sharing data among multiple parties due to vulnerability and inefficiency reasons. The customer-centric energy usage data management framework based on redactable signature (RS) technology can be seen as an effective solution. It offers customers the flexibility to remove parts of privacy-sensitive data depending on different data usage demands, and ensures data verifiability for third party service providers. However, existing RS schemes are computationally inefficient for constrained devices such as smart meters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:YPNY0knpFBYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17723044263329077668", "cites_id": ["17723044263329077668"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17143-7_27", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pBlBVtvm9PUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
