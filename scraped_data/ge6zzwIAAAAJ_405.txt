In contrast to clustering on a static set of data, streaming data clustering does not have a global view of the complete data. The local (or partial) view in a high-speed stream makes clustering a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel density peak based algorithm,  TStream , for tracking the evolution of clusters and outliers in social media streams, via the evolutionary actions of cluster adjustment, emergence, disappearance, split, and merge.  TStream  is based on a temporal decay model and text stream summarisation. The decay model captures the decreasing importance of textual documents over time. The stream summarisation compactly represents them with the help of cells ( aka  micro-clusters) in the memory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:TesyEGJKHF4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15328137658334192907", "cites_id": ["15328137658334192907"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9875968/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CyVMAf17uNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
