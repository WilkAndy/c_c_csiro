Federated learning enables distributed participants to collaboratively learn a commonly shared model while holding data locally. However, it is also faced with expensive communication and limitations due to the heterogeneity of distributed data sources and lack of access to global data. In this paper, we investigate a practical distributed learning scenario where multiple downstream tasks (e.g., classifiers) could be efficiently learned from dynamically updated and non-iid distributed data sources while providing local data privatization. We introduce a new distributed/collaborative learning scheme to address communication overhead via latent compression, leveraging global data while providing privatization of local data without \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10667215044492920788", "cites_id": ["10667215044492920788"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9729632/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1Ae0zZCPCZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
