By offering the capability to connect and integrate both digital and physical entities, IoT becomes an important paradigm that enables a whole new class of applications and services. Security is one of the most challenging issues that need to be addressed before these IoT applications and services can be fully embraced. In this survey, we investigate the major research efforts over the period of 2013-2019 that address IoT security and privacy issues. We provide extensive discussions on securing cloud-based IoT solutions. The main focus of these discussions is on securing the information in transit between IoT devices and IoT applications, where most of the data processing and modelling tasks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14675341064420201613", "cites_id": ["14675341064420201613"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9011598/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jRR43vFIqcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 28, "2022": 31, "2023": 12}}
