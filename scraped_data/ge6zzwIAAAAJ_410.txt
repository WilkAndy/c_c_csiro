It allows a rogue process to read the kernel data in CPU L1D cache. To defend against the Meltdown attack in legacy processors, the most effective software-only mitigation approach is to unmap kernel memory from user processes, known as kernel page-table isolation (KPTI).In this paper, we present a novel Meltdown-type attack, named KPTImew, that can defeat KPTI in Linux and reliably dump all the target data in the kernel address space. We observe that there still exists kernel memory mapped in a user process, indicating that the mapped memory content can still be leaked through the Meltdown attack. However, the Meltdown attack is limited to leaking data that must be resident in CPU L1D cache. To lift the limitation, we propose a new technique, called reDump, as a part of our contribution. reDump exploits \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2vr6o8x5NLkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16085936315953355262", "cites_id": ["16085936315953355262"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404821003801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_pn0N9q5PN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
