As these edge devices are in proximity to users, this results in improved application response times and reduces load on the cloud data center (cdc). In this paper, we propose a security and deadline aware scheduling algorithm called RT-SANE (Real-Time Security Aware scheduling on the Network Edge). Applications with stringent privacy requirements are scheduled on an mdc closer to the user, whereas others can be scheduled on a cdc or a remote mdc. We also discuss how application performance and network latency influence the choice of an mdc or cdc. The intuition is that due to a lower communication latency between the user & the mdc, more applications are able to meet their deadlines when run on themdc. Conversely, applications with loose deadlines may be executed on a cdc. In order to facilitate this, we also propose a distributed orchestration architecture and protocol that is both performance & security aware. Simulation results show that RTSANE offers superior real-time performance compared to a number of other scheduling policies in an Edge computing environment, while meeting application privacy requirements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:OzeSX8-yOCQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17769148348553989909", "cites_id": ["17769148348553989909"], "pub_url": "http://dspace.iitrpr.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/2894", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FY_HLEeymPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
