In this article, we propose a one-off and attack-agnostic Feature Manipulation (FM)-Defense to detect and purify adversarial examples in an interpretable and efficient manner. The intuition is that the classification result of a normal image is generally resistant to non-significant intrinsic feature changes, e.g., varying the thickness of handwritten digits. In contrast, adversarial examples are sensitive to such changes since the perturbation lacks transferability. To enable manipulation of features, a Combo-variational autoencoder is applied to learn disentangled latent codes that reveal semantic features. The resistance to classification change over the morphs, derived by varying and reconstructing latent codes, is used to detect suspicious inputs. Furthermore, Combo-VAE is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6308736238361856270", "cites_id": ["6308736238361856270"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9460767/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DkkxBS8ijVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
