To secure passwords against attacks, protection is applied to the password authentication protocol (PAP). The implementation of the protection scheme becomes an important factor in protecting PAP against attacks. We focus on two basic protection in Android, i.e., SSL/TLS-based PAP and timestamp-based PAP. Previously, we proposed an automated tool, GLACIATE, to detect authentication flaws. We were curious whether orchestration (i.e., involving manual-effort) works better than automation. To answer this question, we propose an orchestrated approach, AuthExploit and compare its effectiveness GLACIATE. We study requirements for correct implementation of PAP and then apply GLACIATE to identify protection enhancements automatically. Through dependency analysis, GLACIATE matches the implementations against the abstracted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7604610946447154786", "cites_id": ["7604610946447154786"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9317767/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yp4HZl0BiWkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
