Their definition of complete ROB (CROB) can even support the ROB when the keys are malignantly generated. Motivated by the fact that the signature and the key could be illegally produced in some circumstances, we extended the ROB security one step further to guarantee that one valid signature cannot be modified to another valid signature under a different public key, which we call extreme robustness (EXROB). After analysing the relations between the EXROB security and existing ROB related definitions, we describe generic constructions to convert any digital signature scheme that is unforgeable into an EXROB secure one. Our hash-then-sign construction is very efficient, which only \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=566510557556776708", "cites_id": ["566510557556776708"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439752030445X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BB-uwFmm3AcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
