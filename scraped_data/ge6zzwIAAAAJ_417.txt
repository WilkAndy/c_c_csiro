Since the service provider may not be fully trusted, a crucial requirement in outsourced data sharing is therefore to ensure that users can verify the integrity and authenticity of their query results. In outsourced healthcare data sharing, because the data contains sensitive information, an equally significant issue is to guarantee that the sharing process does not lead to any information leakages. Though some privacy-preserving authentication solutions have been presented to address these issues, unfortunately, none of them consider the risk of privacy leakage during the dissemination of authenticated healthcare data. That is, the queried data may be leaked by the user since any third party getting hold of a signed data would be convinced of its validity. In other words, for privacy concerns, we need a secure mechanism to ensure that only a specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1832637335403794452", "cites_id": ["1832637335403794452"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-62576-4_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FJDcYvLVbhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
