The problem is how to ensure end-to-end security (e.g., integrity, and authenticity) of such data stream for risk-critical applications. We refer this as an online security verification problem. Existing security techniques cannot deal with this problem because they were not designed to deal with high volume, high velocity data in real-time. Furthermore, they are inefficient as they introduce a significant buffering delay during security verification, resulting in a requirement of large buffer size for the stream processing server. To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Key Length Based Security Framework (DLSeF) based on the shared key derived from synchronized prime numbers; the key is dynamically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4065866391150696646", "cites_id": ["4065866391150696646"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26187-4_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xpi83PDbbDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 25, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
