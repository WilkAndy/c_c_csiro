These can be perceived as gazetteers that record frequently visited locations, e.g. shopping malls and museums, and potentially more sensitive locations, e.g. an individual's home/work locations. Density-based clustering approaches are generally used for gazetteer discovery. However, existing clustering solutions are inefficient for big data scenarios and often disregard mobility features derived from trajectories data. Further, automated gazetteer discovery applications may cause privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a sensitive gazetteer automated discovery approach based on \u03a9-cluster with robust privacy controls. The approach identifies sensitive gazetteers from massive trajectory data, with location entropy-based filtering used to reduce \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17385784345968925868", "cites_id": ["17385784345968925868"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8258036/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rFwGs7-2RvEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
