While dealing with big sensing data streams from Internet of Things (IoT), a data stream manager (DSM) must always verify the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the data to ensure end-to-end security as the medium of communication is wireless and untrusted. Malicious attackers could access and modify the data at any time/place from source to cloud data center. Existing technologies for data security verification are not suitable for data-streaming applications, as the verification should be performed in real time and which introduces a delay in the data stream. In this chapter, we will propose a Dynamic Prime-Number-Based Security Verification (DPBSV) framework for big data streams. Our framework is based on 264a common shared key that is updated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12892242959859646879", "cites_id": ["12892242959859646879"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781315154008-13/end-end-security-framework-big-sensing-data-streams-deepak-puthal-surya-nepal-rajiv-ranjan-jinjun-chen", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nwF3fKpy6rIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
