Resource constrained sensing devices are being used widely to build and deploy self-organising wireless sensor networks for a variety of critical applications. Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. The key requirement of such applications is the need for near real-time stream data processing in large scale sensing networks. This trend gives birth to an area called big sensing data streams. One of the key problems in big data is to ensure end-to-end security where a Data Stream Manager (DSM) must always verify the security of the data before executing a query to ensure data security (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, availability and freshness) as the medium of communication is untrusted. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to ensure the trustworthiness of collected data so that any decisions are made on the correct data, followed by protecting the data streams from information leakage and unauthorised access. This thesis considers end-to-end means from source sensors to cloud data centre. Although some security issues are not new, the situation is aggravated due to the features of the five Vs of big sensing data streams: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value. Therefore, it is still a significant challenge to achieve data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8895435430804352507", "cites_id": ["8895435430804352507"], "pub_url": "https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/102735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-22E72TvcnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
