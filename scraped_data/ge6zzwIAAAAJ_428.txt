We have developed a collaborative online community, called NextStep, for the Australian federal government agency, the Department of Human Services, to help parents currently receiving a welfare payment transition into full-time work to become self-sufficient. The community enabled its members to share their experiences and relevant information, and support each other during the transition process. During the one-year trial of the community, we found that participants expressed in the discussion forum the reasons why they were having difficulties (re-) entering the workforce fulltime. We thus decided to analyse the content of the forum with the explicit aim of identifying the barriers to work \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12486317165199055983", "cites_id": ["12486317165199055983"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7809688/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b1yNcE5PSK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
