Our approach not only releases the burdens of data integrity management from a storage service by handling it through an independent third party data Integrity Management Service (IMS), but also reduces the security risk of the data stored in the storage services by checking the data integrity with the help of IMS. We define data integrity protocols for a number of different scenarios, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, service and protocols by implementing them on a public cloud, Amazon S3. We also study the impact of our proposed protocols on the performance of the storage service and show that the benefits of our approach outweigh the little penalty on the storage service performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=263961573596983095", "cites_id": ["263961573596983095"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6008724/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N--ZFKfHqQMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
