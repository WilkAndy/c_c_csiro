Such datasets are often from various sources (Variety) yet unstructured such as social media, sensors, scientific applications, surveillance, video and image archives, Internet texts and documents, Internet search indexing, medical records, business transactions and web logs; and are of large size (Volume) with fast data in/out (Velocity). Various technologies are being discussed to support the handling of big data such as massively parallel processing databases, scalable storage systems, and cloud computing platforms.Big data is an emerging research area which requires new technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data within tolerable elapsed times.
