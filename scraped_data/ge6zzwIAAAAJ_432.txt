Overall, the results show that participants have high expectations for the behaviour of others in the community, expecting them to be trustworthy, helpful and supportive. There is a gap, however, between the respondents\u201f own attitude and behaviour with respect to trust and what they expect of others in the community. The results of this survey will serve as a baseline against which to compare results obtained at the end of our community trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a trust survey has been conducted in an online community to establish the initial baseline members\u201f trust. We also present the initial results obtained at the end of the trial."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13977648848908732683", "cites_id": ["13977648848908732683"], "pub_url": "https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-997/trum2013_paper_4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C0laQpKV-sEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
