This article describes the concept and architecture of the proposed email service along with a secure mail exchange protocol. We have also demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed email service by building a prototype system using today\u2019s proven technologies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11631050046451796332", "cites_id": ["11631050046451796332"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP112544&sb=RECENT&n=8&rpp=50&page=46&tr=5047&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bMmMr2TKaaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
