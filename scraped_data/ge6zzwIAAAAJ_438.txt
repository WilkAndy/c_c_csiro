This paper presents a service-oriented user interface design for the next generation Web. The design leverages the advances of semantic Web and service composition technologies to provide an intelligent and generic user interface to query, compose and execute Web services for a variety of user tasks. First, a simple cost model is developed for estimating the development and learning overheads of Web service interfaces for service-oriented applications as the motivation of this work. Then, the authors present the design of the service-oriented browser and discuss the enabling technologies. A prototype system is developed using existing technologies and standards as a proof of concept."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1788670155136804233", "cites_id": ["1788670155136804233"], "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/article/service-oriented-user-interface-next/55123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iaVFgQei0hgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
