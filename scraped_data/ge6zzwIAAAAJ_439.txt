The heart of our system runs a protocol which guarantees trusted behavior at multiple layers; from the hardware device itself, to the software executing on the hardware, and finally to the application hosted in the remote server. This combination assures end-to-end trust and makes our system resilient to physical attacks (e.g. to the device and wire tapping) as well as logical attacks (e.g. main-in-the-middle attack). Our system utilizes web-based proxy communication using standard HTML tags and JavaScript to coordinate communication amongst different components. This enables our system not having to install any extra drivers typically required for supporting communication in most existing technologies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17658687975446043648", "cites_id": ["17658687975446043648"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17502-2_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AFzsZydDEPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
