It collaboratively runs a deep neural network model where the model is split into two parts, one for the client and the other for the server. Therefore, the server has no direct access to raw data processed at the client. Until now, the split learning is believed to be a promising approach to protect the client's raw data; for example, the client's data was protected in healthcare image applications using 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) models. However, it is still unclear whether the split learning can be applied to other deep learning models, in particular, 1D CNN."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16467591289883391427", "cites_id": ["16467591289883391427"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3320269.3384740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w_XQcwejiOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 21, "2022": 32, "2023": 12}}
