Though this model is simple, implementing large-scale, cross-organizational distributed applications may be difficult to achieve in general, as there is no guarantee that service composition will be possible because of incompatibilities between the service contracts. This article examines and addresses this problem, first by identifying and specifying contract compatibility conditions based on standards such as WS-Business Activity, and second, through the use of a compatibility checking tool that enables application developers to perform checks at design time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10142045451774829577", "cites_id": ["10142045451774829577"], "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/article/international-journal-web-services-research/4103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CaTngJrIv4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
