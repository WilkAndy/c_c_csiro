In this paper, we address the problem of successful completion of collaborations under a new model, called collaborative resource model. This model is graph-based, allowing participants to describe different ways to contribute and require resources for collaborations and the dependency relations among these resources. Resources in this model are protected by access control policies declared not only by resource providers but also by resource requestors. The requestors policies state how they will redistribute the acquired resources and thus increase the confidence of the providers to share resources. Except access control policies, resources are also constrained by usage conditions to reflect the fact, for instance, that a resource might be available only at some time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15706356309366947472", "cites_id": ["15706356309366947472"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03354-4_22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kD6I99gv-NkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
