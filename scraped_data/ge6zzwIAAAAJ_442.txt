It is the gap between sensory data and semantic models. Often the sensory data and associated context compose situations which have not been anticipated by system architects. Emergence is a phenomenon that can be employed to deal with such unanticipated situations. In the past, researchers and practitioners paid little attention to applying the concepts of emergence to multimedia information retrieval. Recently, there have been attempts to use emergent semantics as a way of dealing with the semantic gap. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the field as it applies to multimedia. We begin with the concepts behind emergence, cover the requirements of emergent systems, and survey the existing body of research."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2627489296778139690", "cites_id": ["2627489296778139690"], "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/emergent-semantics-overview/27091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KhiaKZi3diQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
