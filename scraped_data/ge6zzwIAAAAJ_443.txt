First, we identify three different types of entities, namely resources, participants and their relations, and the set of policies applicable to them. We then propose an integrated framework to provide a solution for managing shared data in dynamic collaborations. We discuss the implementation of the framework in the context of our storage service provisioning architecture and present the cost of such framework in comparison to the storage cost."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4018992592755858970", "cites_id": ["4018992592755858970"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MvESrc4_pb4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1296&dq=info:Gp4jNnhUxjcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9TSSCz_ilk&sig=hM6Vm_s40OUIq-7vrNrcufsJW1M", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Gp4jNnhUxjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
