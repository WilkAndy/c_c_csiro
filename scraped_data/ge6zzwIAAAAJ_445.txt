In this paper, we present a binary representation-based framework for modelling and querying video object relationships at a semantic level. The framework supports spatio-temporal queries using high-level concepts. We propose a set of semantic (qualitative) terms to describe the spatio-temporal relations between objects and then show how such qualitative terms can be calculated within the proposed framework using a fuzzy-logic-based approach. We also report the experimental results performed on a video clip from the MPEG-7 video content archive."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13570772167056360913", "cites_id": ["13570772167056360913"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35592-4_14", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0QUniWIRVbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
