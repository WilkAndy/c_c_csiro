Both commercial developers and academic research community is actively interested in this area. Such systems will nd wide usage in the next millennium similar to relational systems today. This has become possible due to ever cheaper processing and storage costs. Texture and color are important cues for Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems. Texture is usually extracted from the gray scale images. The contribution of the color to the texture perception has been mostly ignored. In this paper we introduce the notion of Pixel Descriptor (PID), which combines the human perception of color and texture into a single vector. It is a vector of responses to the image from a set of texture and color descriptor functions (lters). We use Gabor functions to capture human texture perception, and Gaussian functions to capture colors which fall within the range of human perception. We describe details of feature for CBIR based on PIDs. We compare the performance of the feature for image retrieval against other published features using CHITRA system we are developing. For this comparison we use relevance feedback technique to account for user subjectivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10106318586514639112", "cites_id": ["10106318586514639112"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0546e87da61f27f506634769c17b8035bf8e933a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CAkieDXbQIwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1}}
