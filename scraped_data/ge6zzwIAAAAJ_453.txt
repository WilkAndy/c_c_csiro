So far, researchers have developed many solutions that can select appropriate responses for multi-turn conversations. However, these works are still suffering from the semantic mismatch problem when responses and context share similar words with different meanings. In this article, we propose a novel chatbot model based on Semantic Awareness Matching, called SAM. SAM can capture both similarity and semantic features in the context by a two-layer matching network. Appropriate responses are selected according to the matching probability made through the aggregation of the two feature types. In the evaluation, we pick 4 widely used datasets and compare SAM\u2019s performance to that of 12 other models. Experiment results show that SAM achieves \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3545570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G3tkbu3BSsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
