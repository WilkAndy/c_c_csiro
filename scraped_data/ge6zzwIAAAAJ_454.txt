However, they are susceptible to unilateral revocations by the vendor making them a risky proposition for long-running applications with strict performance requirements. It is challenging to effectively balance the cost savings that transient resources provide with the associated revocation risk which, if realised, can impact application performance. To address this challenge, we propose an approach for risk-aware cloud cost optimization that is inspired by the concept of  portfolio diversification .  Contract diversification  mitigates the revocation risk by procuring the required compute capacity as a mixed portfolio of transient and non-transient resources.  Resource diversification  further diversifies the risk by using multiple transient resource \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:TGkaJS32XoUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10061569/", "cites_per_year": {}}
