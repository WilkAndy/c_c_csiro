However, their performance relies on a long sequence of tokens per instance and a large number of codebook entries, resulting in long sampling times and considerable computation to fit the categorical posterior. To address these issues, we propose the Masked Vector Quantization (MVQ) framework which increases the representational capacity of each code vector by learning mask configurations via a stochastic winner-takes-all training regime called Multiple Hypothese Dropout (MH-Dropout). On ImageNet 6464, MVQ reduces FID in existing vector quantization architectures by up to  at 2 tokens per instance and  at 5 tokens. These improvements widen as codebook entries is reduced and allows for  speed-up in token sampling during inference. As an additional benefit, we find that smaller latent spaces lead to MVQ identifying transferable visual representations where multiple can be smoothly combined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Y9VhQm-5nPIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06626", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:swTSNLV8hlYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
