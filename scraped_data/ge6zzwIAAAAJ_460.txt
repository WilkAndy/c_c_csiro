These companies discreetly inspect users\u2019 files to undertake deduplication, which stores only a single instance of files that are redundant across their user base. By undertaking deduplication in this way, the CSP acquires low-cost storage at the expense of user privacy. This paper proposes universal deduplication, an alternative approach which shifts the advantage of deduplication from the CSP to the users, while ensuring semantic security of the users\u2019 transmitted data. Universal deduplication leverages indications of the trustworthiness of data availability on the Internet, paired with a format to automatically combine client-side deduplication and end-to-end encryption. By referencing data that is publicly available on the Internet, user files can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:6ZzL7HXColQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10063547/", "cites_per_year": {}}
