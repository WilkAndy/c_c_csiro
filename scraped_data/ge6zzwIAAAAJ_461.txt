A sought after feature in the trending ephemeral context is to set download constraints of a particular file - a file can only be downloaded a limited number of times and/or for a limited period of time. Emerging end-to-end encrypted file sharing services with enhanced expiration control are attempts to meet the needs. Although such new services have drawn much attention, their server can still observe and control metadata of such download constraints, which could reveal partial data information. To address this challenge, we propose OblivSend, a privacy-preserving file sharing web service that 1) supports end-to-end encryption, 2) allows a limited period of time and a limited number of downloads at users\u2019 control, and 3) protects expiration control metadata from the server \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:U0iAMwwPxtsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22390-7_17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AaKjMDpfZlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
