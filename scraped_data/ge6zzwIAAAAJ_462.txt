However, their detection is still formidable, due to the diverse forms of software development and the diverse programming styles of software developers. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability detection tool to explore security issues in source code using deep learning-based function classification. Specifically, we first extract and parse function prototypes in the source code. Then, with the help of the pre-built corpus, we split the function prototypes into segmentations with semantic meanings. By utilizing deep learning-based classifiers, the segmentations are further classified into seven categories. Finally, we use static scanning analyzers to separately detect vulnerabilities of different types of functions. Additionally, the experimental results show that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23020-2_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:STCyyjie220J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
