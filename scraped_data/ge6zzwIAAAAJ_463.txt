Likewise, trajectories have the potential to reveal sensitive information about individuals, e.g., religious beliefs or sexual orientations. Accordingly, trajectory datasets require appropriate sanitization. Due to their strong theoretical privacy guarantees, differential private publication mechanisms receive much attention. However, the large amount of noise required to achieve differential privacy yields structural differences, e.g., ship trajectories passing over land. We propose a deep learning-based Reconstruction Attack on Protected Trajectories (RAoPT), that leverages the mentioned differences to partly reconstruct the original trajectory from a differential private release. The evaluation shows that our RAoPT model can reduce the Euclidean and Hausdorff distances \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:PlWzFYVEG4EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3564625.3564628", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1Fg4oeMopfoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
