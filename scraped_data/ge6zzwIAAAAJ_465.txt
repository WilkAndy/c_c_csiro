Therefore, unauthorized redistribution of private pre-trained DNNs may cause severe economic loss for model owners. For protecting the ownership of DNN models, DNN watermarking schemes have been proposed by embedding secret information in a DNN model and verifying its presence for model ownership. However, existing DNN watermarking schemes compromise the model utility and are vulnerable to watermark removal attacks because a model is modified with a watermark. Alternatively, a new approach dubbed DEEPJUDGE was introduced to measure the similarity between a suspect model and a victim model without modifying the victim model. However, DEEPJUDGE would only be designed to detect the case where a suspect model's architecture is the same as a victim model's. In this work, we propose a novel DNN fingerprinting technique dubbed DEEPTASTER to prevent a new attack scenario in which a victim's data is stolen to build a suspect model. DEEPTASTER can effectively detect such data theft attacks even when a suspect model's architecture differs from a victim model's. To achieve this goal, DEEPTASTER generates a few adversarial images with perturbations, transforms them into the Fourier frequency domain, and uses the transformed images to identify the dataset used in a suspect model. The intuition is that those adversarial images can be used to capture the characteristics of DNNs built on a specific dataset.
