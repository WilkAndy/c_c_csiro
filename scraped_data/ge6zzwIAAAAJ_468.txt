This paper proposes a new deep learning-based vulnerability detection tool dubbed VulDeBERT by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), on the vulnerable code dataset. To support VulDeBERT, we develop a new code analysis tool to extract well-represented abstract code fragments from C and C++ source code. The experimental results show that VulDeBERT outperforms the state-of-the-art tool, VulDeePecker [1] for two security vul- nerability types (CWE-119 and CWE-399). For the CWE-119 dataset, VulDeBERT achieved an Fl score of 94.6 %, which is significantly better than VulDeePecker, achieving an Fl score of 86.6 % in the same settings. Again, for the CWE-399 dataset, VulDeBERT achieved an Fl score of 97.9 %, which is also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:I858iXPj1OkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9985089/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YR0Ffncv__sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
