Adding fog computing nodes in proximity to a data generation/ actuation source can support data analysis tasks that have stringent deadline constraints. We introduce a real time, security-aware scheduling algorithm that can execute over a fog environment [1 , 2]. The applications we consider comprise of: (i) interactive applications which are less compute intensive, but require faster response time; (ii) computationally intensive batch applications which can tolerate some delay in execution. From a security perspective, applications are divided into three categories: public, private and semi-private which must be hosted over trusted, semi-trusted and untrusted resources. We propose the architecture and implementation of a distributed orchestrator for fog computing, able to combine task requirements (both performance and security) and resource properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:yTLRzDEmwhEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://dspace.iitrpr.ac.in:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/3925", "cites_per_year": {}}
