However, they faced two challenges. Firstly, the stock movement is affected by both technical fundamentals and external textual information. Secondly, resource data are often highly-noisy and heterogeneous, and prediction based on noisy data usually leads to significant errors. We propose a robust and accurate model (R-Net) that incorporates both technical information and qualitative sentiment derived from news reports for daily stock movement prediction in response to these challenges. A variety of enhancement strategies are adopted to improve the prediction model's robustness and accuracy. Specifically, a multimodal CNN and LSTM neural networks are applied to extract semantics from text and model complex temporal characteristics for stock market prediction.
