This leads to the classification problem of frequent false positives and false negatives, and a reliance on manual reporting of phishing by users. Profiler is a distributed phishing risk assessment tool that combines three email profiling dimensions: (1) threat level, (2) cognitive manipulation, and (3) email content type to detect email phishing. Unlike pure ML-based approaches, Profiler does not require large data sets to be effective and evaluations on real-world data sets show that it can be useful in conjunction with ML algorithms to mitigate the impact of concept drift."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:wyM6WWKXmoIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9912286/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tfnIpKzzQFcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
