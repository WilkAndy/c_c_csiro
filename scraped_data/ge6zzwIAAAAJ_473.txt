The majority of such schemes cannot be used to authenticate general directed graphs (GDGs); other schemes cannot be used for addressing either the issue of dynamic update or the issue of information leakage (such as the existence of nodes/edges and structural relationship of the graph). Also, all the existing schemes do not consider the forward security: if the signer\u2019s secret key has been compromised, all previously generated signatures remain valid. This property provides high-level security protection for authentication schemes. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a forward-secure edge authentication scheme for GDGs. Observe that existing such schemes can only give a proof such that \u2018there is an edge between nodes  and \u2019. Our scheme, however \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:RtRctb2lSbAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/65/7/1653/6178962", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Vjr030aiDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
