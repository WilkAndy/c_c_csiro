While the current pandemic is transforming our normal lives in an unprecedented way, the computing and information services ecosystem have provided the much-needed support to the continuity of the social interactions and the organizational functions. As COVID-19 continues to transform the global society, it is also exposing the weaknesses of the current services ecosystems and newer research challenges to further leveraging emerging computing and services technologies to provide secure, privacy-aware and resilient infrastructure and services during pandemics. The goal of this special issue has been to solicit impactful research papers that will be of immediate value to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as for future pandemic and crises."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:rCNdntzdTkkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9799729/", "cites_per_year": {}}
