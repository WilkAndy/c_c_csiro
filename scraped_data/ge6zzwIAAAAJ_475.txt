In some examples, a method comprises storing mapping data for multiple hosts in a global network and in a local network. The method further comprises receiving a first data packet from one of the multiple hosts in the local network. The first data packet comprises a first source address being the local network address of the host in the local network, a first destination address being the local network address of the host in the global network and payload data. The method further comprises determining, based on the mapping data, the global network address of the host in the local network and a global network address of the host in the global network, and sending a second data packet over the global network."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:EaFouW7jFu4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220182320A1/en", "cites_per_year": {}}
