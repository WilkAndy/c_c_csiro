The involvement of human actors and their dynamic behavior introduce a range of factors that necessitates a deep dive into human-centric security and privacy aspects. The goal of this Research Topic was to explore the role that the human plays within the security and privacy domain, and how the humans should interact with the security and privacy aspects. This Research Topic specifically looked at what human-attributable factors impact or affect the perception and adaption of security and privacy. Traditionally, the human player has often been attributed as the weakest link in the technology system, with prior research looking into traditional aspects of human usage of technology. For instance, users are often hardly able to understand the security and privacy-related messages generated by these systems since they are written by tech-savvy developers. Even computer science graduates have difficulties in understanding some of the security and privacy messages generated by modern computer applications, including mobile phones, web applications, etc. Many recent data breaches are attributed to users, deliberate or accidental. The challenge is how to build the security and privacy solutions usable by end-users.Toward addressing this challenge, our focus with this Research Topic is to facilitate a paradigm shift on how we address security and privacy problems, moving away from a technology focus to the use of a socio-technological dimension. Including both hypothesis and theory perspectives, as well as original research and user studies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2022.848058/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Big_Data&id=848058", "cites_per_year": {}}
