Multiple vendors provide security solutions developed using heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. Hence, it is a challenging rather impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion. Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on different aspects of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15355098266113815410", "cites_id": ["15355098266113815410"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3305268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cjPuqoREGNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 23, "2022": 20, "2023": 8}}
