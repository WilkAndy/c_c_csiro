In the edge computing environment, Generative Models (GMs) have been found to be valuable and useful in machine learning tasks such as data augmentation and data pre-processing. Federated learning and distributed learning refer to training machine learning models in the edge computing network. However, federated learning and distributed learning also bring additional risks to GMs since all peers in the network have access to the model under training. In this article, we study the vulnerabilities of federated GMs to data-poisoning-based backdoor attacks via gradient uploading. We additionally enhance the attack to reduce the required poisonous data samples and cope with dynamic network environments.
