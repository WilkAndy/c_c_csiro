It has enabled many modern digital services in cyberspace that we take for granted. Many of these digital systems rely on public-key cryptosystems, which are based on hard computational problems in mathematics. Advances in quantum computing present potentially efficient solutions to these hard problems. Hence, current public-key cryptosystems relying on the hardness of such mathematical problems are not quantum-safe.There is now an urgent need to develop cryptosystems that can both run on current computing devices and be incorporated into existing internet protocols, while at the same time withstand an attacker with a quantum computer. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) offers the potential to develop such systems. However, current post-quantum systems are not simple \u201cdrop-in\u201d replacements for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4167645696125825971&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
