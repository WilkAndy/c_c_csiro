IoT devices are now being used in a wide range of applications to transfer or share relevant information, hence reducing human interventions. With such widespread IoT solutions, security becomes a significant concern. Many of the IoT devices are vulnerable due to several reasons, including in-secure implementations, poor life cycle management, and inappropriate configurations, leading to an increase in the risk of these devices getting exposed and attacked. However, the current security approaches for detecting compromised IoT devices are inefficient, especially for zero-day attacks. Since no one knows how a new attack would look like, it will be useful to monitor and detect anomalies using accurate detection techniques. This work probes the possibility of detecting IoT network traffic anomalies using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-0010-4_16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:89ytdIDe4GIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
