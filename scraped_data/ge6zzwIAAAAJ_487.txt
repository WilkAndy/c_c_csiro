However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called\" Peeler\"(Profiling kErnEl-Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware's inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system's kernel events \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210112434E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
