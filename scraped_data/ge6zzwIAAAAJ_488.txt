SLO, the level of support organisations gain from the public, is typically assessed through surveys or focus groups, which require expensive manual efforts and yield quickly-outdated results. In this paper, we present SIRTA (Social Insight via Real-Time Text Analytics), a novel real-time text analytics system for assessing and monitoring organisations\u2019 SLO levels by analysing the public discourse from social posts. To assess SLO levels, our insight is to extract and transform peoples\u2019 stances towards an organisation into SLO levels. SIRTA achieves this by performing a chain of three text classification tasks, where it identifies task-relevant social posts, discovers key SLO risks discussed in the posts, and infers stances specific to the SLO risks. We leverage recent language understanding techniques (e.g., BERT) for building our classifiers. To monitor SLO levels over time, SIRTA employs quality control mechanisms to reliably identify SLO trends and variations of multiple organisations in a market. These are derived from the smoothed time series of their SLO levels based on exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) calculation. Our experimental results show that SIRTA is highly effective in distilling stances from social posts for SLO level assessment, and that the continuous monitoring of SLO levels afforded by SIRTA enables the early detection of critical SLO changes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10205275", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S_NLmWQDI5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
