It has been widely used in many applications such as smart cities, smart factories, supply chains, smart grid, and precision health. One of the key challenges in practice is to find a suitable lightweight authentication protocol with concerns of security, performance, compatibility, and usability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Due to the lack of security standards for such IoT devices, it is challenging to choose a suitable authentication protocol in practice. For example, many lightweight authentication protocols provide theoretical security analyses, but practical feasibility is not discussed. The integration between a new protocol and the existing standards is non-trivial. It is hence important to develop a novel paradigm for comparing and selecting lightweight authentication protocols considering both theoretical and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9325355/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C0SpJgc7OWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
