We assume that the data consists of identification-relevant and irrelevant components. A variational autoencoder (VAE) based sanitization model is proposed to strip the identification-relevant features and only retain identification-irrelevant components in a privacy-preserving manner. The sanitization allows for task-relevant discrimination (utility) but minimizes the personal identification information leakage (privacy). We conduct extensive empirical evaluations on the real-world face, biometric signal and speech datasets, and validate the effectiveness of our proposed SVAE, as well as the robustness against the membership inference attack."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-62008-0_13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nv3nTgFB-14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
