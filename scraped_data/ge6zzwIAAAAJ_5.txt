The aim of such systems is to enable retrieval of images based on their contents. As part of our research in this area, we are building a prototype content-based image retrieval system called CHITRA. This uses a four-level data model, and we have defined a fuzzy object query language (FOQL) for this system. This system enables retrieval based on high-level concepts, such as \"retrieve images of mountains and sunset\". A problem faced in this system is the processing of complex queries such as \"retrieve all images that have a similar color histogram and a similar texture to the given example image\". Such problems have attracted research attention in recent times. R. Fagin (1996) has given an algorithm for processing such queries and provided a probabilistic upper bound for the complexity of the algorithm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 366, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12164041303603896375", "cites_id": ["12164041303603896375"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/754894/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N2B9Jh5bz6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 9, "2001": 7, "2002": 22, "2003": 13, "2004": 27, "2005": 29, "2006": 25, "2007": 27, "2008": 23, "2009": 30, "2010": 19, "2011": 26, "2012": 19, "2013": 15, "2014": 12, "2015": 17, "2016": 13, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 4}}
