Elections conducted on paper consume a lot of resources and contribute to the destruction of forests, which leads to climate deterioration. Recent online voting experiences in countries, such as the United States, India, and Brazil, demonstrated that further research is needed to improve security guarantees for future elections, to ensure the confidentiality of votes and enable the verification of their integrity and validity. In this paper, we propose a ranked choice online voting system, which addresses these challenges. It eliminates all hardwired restrictions on the possible assignments of points to different candidates according to the voters' personal preferences. In order to protect the confidentiality of the votes, each cast ballot is encrypted using the exponential ElGamal cryptosystem before submission.
