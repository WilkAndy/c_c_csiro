In this era, sensors and other types of sensing devices, wired and wireless networks, platforms and tools, data processing/visualization/analysis and integration engines, and other components of traditional IoT are interconnected through innovative services to realize the value of connected things, people, and virtual Internet spaces. The way of building new IoT applications is changing. We indeed need creative thinking, long-term visions, and innovative methodologies to respond to such a change. The 3rd IEEE International Congress on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2019) is organized to continue promote research and application innovations around the world. The IEEE ICIOT 2019 invited original papers addressing all aspects of IoT systems and services for these systems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/iciot/2019/271400z017/1cTJgyz08CY", "cites_per_year": {}}
