Such spatial behaviors, if shared, can be utilized to identify and recommend friends for web-based social service users. However, such approaches cannot be implemented without solving two key challenges: (a) guaranteeing an individual's privacy in the shared spatiotemporal data, and (b) addressing the inherent sparseness of shared spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Aware Identification and Recommendation of Spatio-Friends (PAIRS) approach, that can infer and recommend potential social connections by analyzing spatiotemporal information of social media users using robust privacy guarantee mechanisms. To achieve this, PAIRS constructs co-occurrence profiles using a cluster-based anchor representation to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8456000/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P932jFAcDVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
