Basically, VANETs is a variant of the mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs), where the mobile nodes are replaced as vehicles. All vehicles in VANETs are equipped with an onboard unit (OBU), which is used to communicate with road side units (RSUs) located on the nearby roadside or other vehicles about the traffic information. Through the communications in VANETs, drivers can promptly increase their awareness of the driving environment. There are three types of communications in VANETs: vehicleto-vehicle (V2V) communication, ie, vehicles communicate with other vehicles, vehicle-to-roadside unit (V2R) communication, ie, vehicles communicate with roadside unites, and roadside unitto-vehicle (R2V) communication, ie, roadside units communicate with vehicles. These different communications are achieved via the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:T_ojBgVMvoEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10593978390058745117&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hb2daTdfBZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
