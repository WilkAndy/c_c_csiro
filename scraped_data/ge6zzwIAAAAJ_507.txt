Existing semantic annotation approaches mainly analyze specific parts of a trajectory, e.g. stops, in association with data from 3rd party geographic sources, e.g. (POI) points-of-interest, road networks. However, these semantic resources are static thus miss important dynamic event information. Recent location-based social networking provides a new dynamic and prevalent source of human activity data that can be a potential semantic resource for annotation. However, using the large-scale spatiotemporal data from online social media gives rise to privacy concerns. This paper thus presents a privacy-preserving semantic annotation framework P-SAFE that (i) identifies dynamic region of interest (DRI) from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94289-6_23", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m5uFbpew5HYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
