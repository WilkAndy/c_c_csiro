This study is being carried out at six locations in five states, ranging from community-based, nurse-led programs to a hospitalfocused, chronic-disease management program supported by highly trained doctors and specialist nurses and seeks to investigate all aspects of using at home telehealth services to better manage chronic disease.The study will introduce telehealth services and observe how each test site integrates these into their established models of care. Based on an Intervention-Control design, 150 chronically ill patients with multiple co-morbidities will be monitored with an additional 300 patients acting as controls."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/ngs6odgch5bhthq76jo74bsype/access/wayback/https://www.ijic.org/articles/10.5334/ijic.1878/galley/2695/download/", "cites_per_year": {}}
