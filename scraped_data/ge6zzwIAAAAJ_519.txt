With the rapid emergence of virtualized environments for accessing software systems and solutions, the volume of users and their data are growing exponentially. According to the IDC, by 2020, when the ICT industry reaches $5 billion - $1.7 billion larger than it is today - at least 80% of the industry\u2019s growth will driven by 3rd platform technologies, such as cloud services and big data analytics. Existing computing infrastructure, software system designs, and use cases will have to take into account the enormity in volume of requests, size of data, computing load, locality and type of users, and every growing needs of all applications. Cloud computing promises reliable services delivered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06859-6_25", "cites_per_year": {}}
