These devices are being exploited to launch attacks in cyber systems. As a result, security has become a significant concern in the design of IoT-based applications. In this article, we present a security architecture for IoT networks by leveraging the underlying features supported by software-defined networks (SDNs). Our security architecture not only restricts network access to authenticated IoT devices but also enforces fine granular policies to secure the flows in the IoT network infrastructure. The authentication is achieved using a lightweight protocol to authenticate IoT devices. Authorization is achieved using a dynamic policy driven approach. Such an integrated security approach involving \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:hNSvKAmkeYkC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17222966165016727268", "cites_id": ["17222966165016727268"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9290076/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5M5k1HlEBO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 28, "2023": 12}}
