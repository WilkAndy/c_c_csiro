However, the usage seems to be far less for the healthcare and dental care recommendation sites. This paper investigates whether adding profiling would make a difference in the quality of the recommendation. It analyses dentists\u2019 qualities from online dental reviews. The patients are classified based on their dental behavior and type of personality obtained from a popular personality test. A survey on 207 participants confirms that participants with different personality prioritise dentists\u2019 qualities differently when selecting their ideal dentist. From this finding, this paper recommends integrating subjective characteristics while profiling both dentists and patients in dental recommendation systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openrepository.aut.ac.nz/handle/10292/8053", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y_5JtCp4hgEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
