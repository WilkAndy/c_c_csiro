We provide an integrated way for service users to query, compose and evaluate Web services. The resulting system is called Web Service Management System (WSMS). We deployed WSMS as the backbone of a bioinformatics experiment framework named Genome Tracker. In this demonstration, we show how WSMS helps biologists conduct experiments easily and effectively using a service-oriented architecture."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17358-5_64", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ktPbfgxJ214J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
