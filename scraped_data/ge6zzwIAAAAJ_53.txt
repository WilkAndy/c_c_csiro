The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12213005075526697219", "cites_id": ["12213005075526697219"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9054825/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A8HPrmhPfakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 21, "2022": 19, "2023": 14}}
