By taking stock, the manifesto maps out a strategy that leverages emerging concepts and technologies to deliver on the full potential of the service paradigm. We explore the major obstacles that hinder the development and potential realization of service computing in the real world, propose research directions, and draw a ten-year roadmap to guide a redefinition of service computing to address emerging IT challenges. We recommend focusing on four main research directions to advance service computing: service design, service composition, crowdsourcing based reputation, and the Internet of Things."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Athman-Bouguettaya/publication/315631477_A_service_computing_manifesto_The_next_10_years/links/59ee8f87aca272029ddf73a3/A-service-computing-manifesto-The-next-10-years.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xoUwo94KVDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
