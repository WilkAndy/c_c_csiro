This paper presents a virtual storage services architecture that addresses these requirements by abstracting physical storage space in order to provide a pool of logical storage space using virtualisation technique. The abstraction of a variety of physical storage technologies and their capabilities is achieved by designing an XML-based simple distributed storage interface (SDSI). This paper also presents a case study of a secure distributed storage service to demonstrate how our architecture offers secure data storing and sharing for dynamic coalitions. We present a summary of our implementation, a Web Services-based prototype storage system using SDSI, and evaluated its performance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4407150/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lKvOutigHBgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
