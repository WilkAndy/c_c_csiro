The important issue for video applications is to accommodate different ways in which a video sequence can function semantically. This requires that the content be described at several levels of abstraction. In this chapter we propose a video metamodel called VIMET and describe an approach to modeling video content such that video content descriptions can be developed incrementally, depending on the application and video genre. We further define a data model to represent video objects and their relationships at several levels of abstraction. With the help of an example, we then illustrate the process of developing a specific application model that develops incremental descriptions of video semantics using our proposed video metamodel (VIMET)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/managing-multimedia-semantics/25971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_lt_IykaTRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
