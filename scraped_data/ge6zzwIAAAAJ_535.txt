It uses a four layer data model we have developed, and enables retrieval based on high level concepts, such as\\retrieve images of MOUNTAINS\", and\\retrieve images of MOUNTAINS and SUNSET\". This paper deals with some issues about query processing encountered in the implementation of the system. The contributions of this paper can be summarized in terms of processing the following four example queries (I1, I2,.., Ik are images). Q1:\\retrieve images similar to I1 based on color\". Q2:\\retrieve images similar to I1 based on color AND texture\". Q3:\\retrieve images similar to I1; I2;::; Ik based on color\". Q4:\\retrieve images similar to I1; I2;::; Ik based on color AND texture\".First a brief review of basic CBIR query processing literature is provided (processing of Q1). Processing of Q2 involves e cient evaluation of combining functions, a problem that has attracted research attention in recent times. Fagin has given an algorithm for evaluating combining functions 11]. In this paper we provide probabilistic analysis of the expected cost of his algorithm. Based on the insight gained, we propose a new multi-step query processing algorithm and prove that it performs better than Fagin's algorithm for certain combining functions. We then consider the problem of processing Query By Multiple Examples (QBME). This problem is encountered, when the user poses queries giving multiple example images and while processing high level concept de nitions. We categorize the previous work (of processing single feature QBME) and propose a new category of algorithms. We have presented techniques of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3a28262bf6239ce297c77ad7a9d869b672f1caf9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AmwknoQYpFsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
