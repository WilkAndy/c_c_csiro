However, with the constant launch of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (eg, Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure) and small companies (eg Rackspace, Ninefold), decision makers (eg application developers, CIOs) are likely to be overwhelmed by choices available. The decision making problem is further complicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application provisioning Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. To address this hard challenge, in our previous work we developed a semi-automated, extensible, and ontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection based on only design time constraints (eg, renting cost, datacentre location, service feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our approach to include the real-time (run-time) QoS (endto-end message latency, end-to-end message throughput) in the decision making process. Hosting of next generation applications in domain of on-line interactive gaming, large scale sensor analytics, and real-time mobile applications on cloud services necessitates optimization of such real-time QoS constraints for meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To this end, we present a real-time QoS aware multi-criteria decision making technique that builds over well known Analytics Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The proposed technique is applicable to selecting Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offers, and it allows users to define multiple design-time and real-time QoS constraints or requirements.
