Practical elections often lead to recounting of the submitted votes and raise questions about the validity of many submitted votes. There are even situations, when the opposition raises concerns about the validity of the whole election process due to insufficient transparency in the verification of the votes and in tallying. To solve this problem, the present paper proposes a new voting protocol based on the blockchain technology. There are several main advantages of the protocol. It does not rely on a trusted tallying authority. All votes are submitted with complete proofs of validity and are available for public access in an encrypted form. We propose a new encryption mechanism to guarantee that nobody can decrypt the votes, but everyone can verify the validity of the votes as well as the outcome of the tallying process by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6814805329826965371", "cites_id": ["6814805329826965371"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17327656", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e2fGUVcNk14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 23, "2022": 25, "2023": 4}}
