The satellite events provide venues for specialist groups to engage in focused discussions on specific sub-areas within service-oriented computing. The satellite events significantly helped to enrich the main conference both by expanding the scope of the scientific topics discussed at the conference and by attracting participants from the wider community. The selected scientific satellite events consisted of two tracks: a workshop track and a PhD symposium track. The ICSOC 2013 workshop track consisted of five workshops on a range of topics in the area of service-oriented computing. The workshops were held on December 2, 2013. Each workshop had its own chairs and Program \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-06859-6.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
