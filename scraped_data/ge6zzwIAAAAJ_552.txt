For most of complex network systems, this classification is based on the error location and describes the topology features of data errors. However, it is not enough to refelect the data features of data errors from network systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14197715872436989795&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yy-I_lxrCMUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
