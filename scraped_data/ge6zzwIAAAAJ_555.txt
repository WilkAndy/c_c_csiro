It provides a cloud-based, low-cost, distributed analytical system, with support for processing of large data sets, collaboration, and reproducibility of results (through publishing and sharing the underlying workflow definition). It includes an evergrowing collection of data sources, data manipulation tools and visualisations.When dealing with human genomic information, using public infrastructure has some important implications for the management of people\u2019s privacy. It is crucial that data is not simply placed \u201cunprotected\u201d in public cloud storage as this would put the data at risk of being unintentionally released, deliberately attacked by malicious third parties, or exposed by compromised services."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sehrish-Kanwal/publication/286439667_Secure_Genomic_Data_Processing_on_the_Cloud_using_TrustStore/links/5668f88108ae193b5fa13d0d/Secure-Genomic-Data-Processing-on-the-Cloud-using-TrustStore.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:38Wj29utEoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
