Services can now be delivered by means of virtual channels, eg, through Web portals or mobile apps, or even online communities, and citizens can exploit these channels to interact with public administration. In this new reality, governments can innovate in order to facilitate the access to services by reducing the red tape that usually characterizes the public service provision.Collecting, understanding and leveraging the characteristics and preferences of citizens is strategic to deliver services and applications of higher value. Only in this way, services and applications can target individual needs, e-Gov offerings can be extended to complex services delivering life-long assistance to citizens and the design of services and applications can be better tailored to citizen requirements. In order to realize this vision, e-Gov services and applications must undergo a personalization process that makes use of automatic user modeling and profiling techniques and delivers solutions that adapt to specific users profiles and follow the citizen along her several and multi-faceted interactions with public administration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-997/pegov2013_proceedings.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qXbBxoTSWuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
