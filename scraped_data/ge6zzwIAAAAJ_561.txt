GAT is based on an event-driven programming model and uses conditional guards to determine when activities are to be executed. One feature of the GAT model is that normal and exceptional situations are treated uniformly. In this paper, we present the design of an engine that executes interacting business processes described in GAT. The approach used is to translate GAT syntax into C# code that runs on top of the .NET framework. As well as discussing the architecture of this engine, we also describe the design decisions leading to the generated code and how available technologies can be used to support the operational GAT model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Surya-Nepal-2/publication/228912267_An_Event-Driven_Workflow_Engine_for_Business_Processes_across_Autonomous_Systems/links/0912f50be7992124ef000000/An-Event-Driven-Workflow-Engine-for-Business-Processes-across-Autonomous-Systems.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JXKVAT8edkMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
