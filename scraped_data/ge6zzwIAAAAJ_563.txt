This paper examines this problem, and proposes a set of solutions by first defining the compatibility criteria and then presenting a tool that enables application developers check those criteria at design time. The tool is designed and developed using standards such as SSDL and WS-BusinessActivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3609190032094205727&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HxfbPTZrFjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
