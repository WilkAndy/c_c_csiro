This paper addresses this problem by first describing the relationship between internal service states, messages and application protocols and then shows how this relationship transforms the problem of ensuring consistent outcomes into a correctness problem that can be addressed with established protocol verification tools."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3597469335820842258", "cites_id": ["3597469335820842258"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0c1a900828e9beb7ffaaf623e32a52b072948e61", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EjX2-0zH7DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
