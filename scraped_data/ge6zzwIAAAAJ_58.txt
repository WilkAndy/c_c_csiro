The proposed approach is realized using the Mashup Services System (MSS), a novel platform to support users to create, use, and manage mashups with little or no programming effort. The proposed approach relieves users from programming-intensive, error-prone, and largely nonreusable output process for creating and maintaining mashups. We describe the overall design of MSS and discuss and evaluate its main enabling technologies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11028786220594935785", "cites_id": ["11028786220594935785"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5492672/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6bdIdqIeDpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
