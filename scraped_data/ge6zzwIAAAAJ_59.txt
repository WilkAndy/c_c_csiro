Meanwhile, privacy protection is one of most concerned issues in big data and cloud applications, thereby requiring strong preservation of customer privacy and attracting considerable attention from both IT industry and academia. Data anonymization provides an effective way for data privacy preservation, and multidimensional anonymization scheme is a widely-adopted one among existing anonymization schemes. However, existing multidimensional anonymization approaches suffer from severe scalability or IT cost issues when handling big data due to their incapability of fully leveraging cloud resources or being cost-effectively adapted to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2577929058832531216", "cites_id": ["2577929058832531216"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6686016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EL_eD9KkxiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
