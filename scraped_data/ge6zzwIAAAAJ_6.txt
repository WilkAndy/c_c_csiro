Efficient and effective retrieval from large content collections forms an important component of the business models for content holders and this is driving a need for research in audio-visual search and retrieval. Current content management systems support retrieval using low-level features, such as motion, colour, texture, beat and loudness. However, low-level features often have little meaning for the human users of these systems, who much prefer to identify content using high-level semantic descriptions or concepts. This creates a gap between the system and the user that must be bridged for these systems to be used effectively. The research presented in this paper describes our approach to bridging this gap in a specific content domain, sports \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 226, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11612688743562624017", "cites_id": ["11612688743562624017"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/500141.500181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ETw6t-KOKKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 10, "2003": 27, "2004": 23, "2005": 27, "2006": 15, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 11, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
