Studies suggest that it is beneficial to use Collaborative Filtering (CF)-based techniques to facilitate Web service recommendations which can achieve high accuracy in predicting the QoS for unobserved Web services. With the QoS, location of users and Web services has been another significant factor in predicting the QoS values. The more factors that are available to the service providers, the more accurate predictions can be generated. However these factors are privacy sensitive and therefore it is risky to disclose them to any third party service provider. To address this challenge, in this paper we develop a privacy preserving protocol to predict missing QoS values and thereby providing Web service recommendations based on past \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1230576701056219185", "cites_id": ["1230576701056219185"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8362675/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MfhTX_3iExEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 16, "2021": 5, "2022": 12, "2023": 9}}
