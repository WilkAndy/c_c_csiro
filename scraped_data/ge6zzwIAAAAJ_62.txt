Emerging defence mechanisms are mainly designed and validated on vision domain tasks (e.g., image classification) on 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architectures; a defence mechanism that is general across vision, text, and audio domain tasks is demanded. This work designs and evaluates a run-time Trojan detection method exploiting STRong Intentional Perturbation of inputs that is a multi-domain input-agnostic Trojan detection defence across Vision, Text and Audio domains\u2014thus termed as STRIP-ViTA. Specifically, STRIP-ViTA is demonstratively independent of not only task domain but also model architectures. Most importantly, unlike other detection mechanisms, it requires neither machine learning expertise nor expensive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2392223242473854430", "cites_id": ["2392223242473854430"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9343758/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3lUWT13iMiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 17, "2023": 18}}
