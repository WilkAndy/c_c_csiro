However, due to the popularity of online social networks, cyber criminals are spamming on these platforms for potential victims. The spams lure users to external phishing sites or malware downloads, which has become a huge issue for online safety and undermined user experience. Nevertheless, the current solutions fail to detect Twitter spams precisely and effectively. In this paper, we compared the performance of a wide range of mainstream machine learning algorithms, aiming to identify the ones offering satisfactory detection performance and stability based on a large amount of ground truth data. With the goal of achieving real-time Twitter spam detection capability, we further evaluated the algorithms in terms of the scalability. The performance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2567657051471724725", "cites_id": ["2567657051471724725"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7937783/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tcD_-XsmoiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
