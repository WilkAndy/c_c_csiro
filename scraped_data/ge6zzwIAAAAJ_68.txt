RT-SANE  ( R eal- T ime  S ecurity  A ware scheduling on the  N etwork  E dge) supports batch and interactive applications, taking account of their deadline and security constraints. RT-SANE chooses between an  $mdc$  (in proximity to a user) and a cloud data center ( $cdc$ ) by taking account of network delay and security tags. Jobs submitted by a user are tagged as: private, semi-private and public, and  $mdcs$  and  $cdcs$  are classified as: trusted, semi-trusted and untrusted. RT-SANE executes private jobs on a user\u2019s local  $mdcs$  or pre-trusted  $cdcs$ , and semi-private and public jobs on remote  $mdcs$  and  $cdcs$ . A security and performance-aware distributed orchestration architecture and protocol is made use of in RT-SANE.
