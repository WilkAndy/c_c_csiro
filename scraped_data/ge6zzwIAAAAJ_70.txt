Users will be able to access applications and data from a \u201cCloud\u201d anywhere in the world on demand. In other words, the Cloud appears to be a single point of access for all the computing, networking, and storage needs of users. The users are assured that the Cloud infrastructure is robust and will always be available at any time. Given these promises, there are still many unanswered questions and research challenges that need to be investigated at greater length.The Cloud Computing and Scientific Applications (CCSA) event series has been promoting research and development activities focused on enabling and scaling scientific applications using distributed computing paradigms, such as cluster, Grid, and Cloud Computing.
