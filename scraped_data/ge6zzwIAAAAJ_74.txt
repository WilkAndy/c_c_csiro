The former aims to expand the applicable machine learning models of FL. The latter focuses on who holds the secret key when applying HE to FL. For the naive HE scheme, the server is set to master the secret key. Such a setting causes a serious problem that if the server does not conduct aggregation before decryption, a chance is left for the server to access the user's update. Inspired by the two challenges, we propose FEDXGB, a federated extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) scheme supporting forced aggregation. FEDXGB mainly achieves the following two breakthroughs. First, FEDXGB involves a new HE based secure aggregation scheme for FL. By combining the advantages of secret sharing and homomorphic encryption \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16804012100039491176", "cites_id": ["16804012100039491176"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9355600/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aD44OPnXM-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 24, "2023": 8}}
