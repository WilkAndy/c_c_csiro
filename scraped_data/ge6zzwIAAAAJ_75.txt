While dealing with big data streams in sensor networks, Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) must always verify the authenticity, and integrity of the data as the medium of communication is untrusted, as malicious attackers could access and modify the data. Existing technologies for data security verification are not suitable for data streaming applications, as the verification in real time introduces significant overheads. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Prime Number Based Security Verification (DPBSV) scheme for big data stream processing. Our scheme is based on a common shared key that is updated dynamically by generating synchronized pairs of prime numbers. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our DPBSV scheme show that it can significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12240526167655865020", "cites_id": ["12240526167655865020"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7345289/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vFoAR7IV36kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
