The novelty of the model is that it introduces the concept of engagement trust and combines it with the popularity trust to derive the social trust of the community as well as of individual members in the community. This enables the recommender system to use these different types of trust to recommend different things to the community, and identify (and recommend) different roles. For example, it recommendsmentors using the engagement trust andleaders using the popularity trust. We then show the utility of the model by analysing data from two types of social networks.
