In this paper, we propose a framework for building trust communities in social networks using social trust. We first introduce the concept of social trust and social capital, and describe the role they play in building trust communities. We then define a social trust model for social networks and the corresponding recommender system for building trust communities in social networks. The novel idea behind our social trust model is that we introduce the concept of engagement trust and combine it with popularity trust to derive a social trust of the community as well as of individual members in the community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17722709495074386376", "cites_id": ["17722709495074386376"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28509-7_23", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yPFZB2O28_UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 11, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
