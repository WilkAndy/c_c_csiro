Sub-tree data anonymization, achieving a good trade-off between data utility and distortion, is a widely adopted scheme to anonymize data sets for privacy preservation. Top-Down Specialization (TDS) and Bottom-Up Generalization (BUG) are two ways to fulfill sub-tree anonymization. However, existing approaches for sub-tree anonymization fall short of parallelization capability, thereby lacking scalability in handling big data on cloud. Still, both TDS and BUG suffer from poor performance for certain value of k-anonymity parameter if they are utilized individually. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines TDS and BUG together for efficient sub-tree anonymization over big data. Further, we design \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4523068629858461074", "cites_id": ["4523068629858461074"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6680880/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kiVtYfQqxT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
