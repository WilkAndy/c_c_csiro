However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features ( e.g. , requested permissions, API calls,  etc. ), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application\u2019s manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=160626122690352482", "cites_id": ["160626122690352482"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8782574/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YlWbiJuoOgIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 15, "2020": 40, "2021": 70, "2022": 61, "2023": 37}}
