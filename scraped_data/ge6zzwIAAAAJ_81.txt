However, with the constant launch of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (e.g., Amazon Web Service and Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g., Rackspace and Ninefold), decision makers (e.g., application developers and chief information officers) are likely to be overwhelmed by choices available. The decision-making problem is further complicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application provisioning QoS constraints. To address this hard challenge, in our previous work, we developed a semiautomated, extensible, and ontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection only based on design-time constraints (e.g., the renting cost, the data center location, the service feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15318334755572641421", "cites_id": ["15318334755572641421"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7124433/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jW5t2EyoldQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
