Edge computing has been introduced to extend the cloud computing architecture to the edge of the network, which analyzes most of the IoT data near the devices that produce and act on that data. Though edge computing solves the latency problem of data processing, it also brings issues to the data security and privacy preservation. One technique which is potential to provide scalable access control to support data security and privacy in edge computing is attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this paper, we propose a primitive named proxy-aided ciphertext-policy ABE (PA-CPABE), which outsources the majority of the decryption computations to edge devices.
