Being a hardware vulnerability, rowhammer bypasses all of the system memory protection, allowing adversaries to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data. Rowhammer attacks have shown to enable privilege escalation, sandbox escape, and cryptographic key disclosures.Recently, several proposals suggest exploiting the spatial proximity between the accessed memory location and the location of the bit flip for a defense against rowhammer. These all aim to deny the attacker's permission to access memory locations near sensitive data.In this paper, we question the core assumption underlying these defenses. We present PThammer, a confused-deputy attack that causes accesses to memory locations that the attacker is not allowed to access.
