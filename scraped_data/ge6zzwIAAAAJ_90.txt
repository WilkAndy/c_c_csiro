However, many of these devices lack a secure non-volatile memory (NVM) for storing keys because of cost constraints. Silicon physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offering unique device specific secrets to electronic commodities are a low-cost alternative to secure NVM. As a physical hardware security primitive, reliability of a PUF is affected by thermal noise and changes in environmental conditions; consequently, PUF responses cannot be directly employed as cryptographic keys. A fuzzy extractor can turn noisy PUF responses into usable cryptographic keys. However, a fuzzy extractor is not immediately mountable on (highly) resource constrained devices due to its implementation overhead.
