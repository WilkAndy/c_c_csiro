The objectives of this study are to use robust statistical methods to research the impact of at home telemonitoring on health care outcomes, acceptability of telemonitoring to patients, carers and clinicians and to identify workplace cultural factors and capacity for organisational change management that will impact on large scale national deployment of telehealth services. Additionally, to develop advanced modelling and data analytics tools to risk stratify patients on a daily basis to automatically identify exacerbations of their chronic conditions. A clinical trial is proposed at five locations in five states and territories along the Eastern Seaboard of Australia. Each site will have 25 Test patients and 50 case matched control patients. All participants will be selected based on clinical criteria of at least two hospitalisations in the previous year or four or more admissions over the last five years for a range of one or more chronic conditions. Control patients are matched according to age, sex, major diagnosis and their Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). The Trial Design is an Intervention control study based on the Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design. Our preliminary data indicates that most outcome variables before and after the intervention are not stationary, and accordingly we model this behaviour using linear mixed-effects (lme \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17201743029553144080", "cites_id": ["17201743029553144080"], "pub_url": "https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ECERiiXeuO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
