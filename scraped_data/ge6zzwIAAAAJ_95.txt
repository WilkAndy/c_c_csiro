There is an inherent risk of (a) data exposure (confidentiality), (b) data tampering (integrity) and (c) denial of access to data (availability). We provide a service-oriented solution for provisioning secure storage service in the hybrid cloud environment, called Trust Store. The system is suitable to facilitate individual as well as collaborative data storage and access. In this demonstration, we show how Trust Store can be used to store and retrieve files securely in the hybrid cloud environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11991091039481663793", "cites_id": ["11991091039481663793"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6123519/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MZGs1cTpaKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
