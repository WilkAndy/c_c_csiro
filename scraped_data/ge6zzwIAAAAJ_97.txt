Cloud computing provides powerful and economical infrastructural resources for cloud users to handle ever increasing data sets in big data applications. However, processing or sharing privacy\u2010sensitive data sets on cloud probably engenders severe privacy concerns because of multi\u2010tenancy. Data encryption and anonymization are two widely\u2010adopted ways to combat privacy breach. However, encryption is not suitable for data that are processed and shared frequently, and anonymizing big data and manage numerous anonymized data sets are still challenges for traditional anonymization approaches. As such, we propose a scalable and cost\u2010effective framework for privacy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15461060730335084339", "cites_id": ["15461060730335084339"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpe.3083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mz9datG4kNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
