Introducing the notion of hybrid clouds to the cloud computing paradigm brings out many challenges in resource provisioning for workflows. Hybrid clouds encounter the following two main obstacles in reaching their full potential: (1) customers' dissatisfaction due to the conflicting nature of the constraints (budget and deadline), and (2) exposure of customers' private data/jobs in hybrid cloud infrastructures. We believe that too little attention is paid to privacy issues for workflow scheduling under deadline constraint. Many algorithms exist to address the cost and time trade-off, however, they suffer from insufficient consideration of privacy. In this study, we present an algorithm that preserves privacy in scheduling of workflows, whilst still considering customers' \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ge6zzwIAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6908671928521602740", "cites_id": ["6908671928521602740"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6904266/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tDY-6YOI4F8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
