However, scheduling distributed applications' jobs (e.g, workflow tasks) on hybrid cloud resources introduces new challenges. One key problem is the danger of exposing private data and jobs in a third-party public cloud infrastructure, for example in healthcare applications. In this article, we tackle the problem of designing workflow scheduling algorithms to meet customers' deadlines, while not compromising data and task privacy requirements. Our work is different from most studies on workflow scheduling where the main goal is to achieve a balance between desirable, yet incompatible constraints, such as meeting the deadline and/or minimizing the execution time.
