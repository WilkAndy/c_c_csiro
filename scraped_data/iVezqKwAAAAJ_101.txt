Here, we develop cumulative trophic patterns for marine ecosystems, featuring sigmoidal cumulative biomass (cumB)\u2013trophic level (TL) and \u2018hockey-stick\u2019 production (cumP)\u2013cumB curves. The patterns have a trophodynamic theoretical basis and capitalize on emergent, fundamental, and invariant features of marine ecosystems. These patterns have strong global support, being observed in over 120 marine ecosystems. Parameters from these curves elucidate the direction and magnitude of marine ecosystem perturbation or recovery; if biomass and productivity can be monitored effectively over time, such relations may prove to be broadly useful \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12532274935265655218", "cites_id": ["12532274935265655218"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534715002207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:snkKoKeV660J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
