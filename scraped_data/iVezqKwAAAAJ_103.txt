Ecosystem models can be used to quantify trade-offs and focus discussion around objectives. Given large structural uncertainties inherent in ecosystem models, however, comparative approaches are recommended to identify results that are robust to model formulation. We developed ecosystem models of the continental shelf and slope of New South Wales, Australia, using two ecosystem modelling frameworks, Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim. The models were calibrated to emulate large-scale changes in ecosystem structure between 1976 and 1996, as predicted by data from fishery-independent trawl surveys. Calibrated models were projected forward under a range of \u201coptimal\u201d fishing efforts designed to achieve economic, conservation or biodiversity objectives.
