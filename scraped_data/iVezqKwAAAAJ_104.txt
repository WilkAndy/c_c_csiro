The models are based partly on original fieldwork conducted for this project by the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and by the PANGAS (Pesca Artesanal del Norte del Golfo de California\u2013Ambiente y Societad [Small-scale Fisheries in the Northern Gulf of California\u2013Environment and Society]) project (http://pangas. arizona. edu/), a consortium of academic and nongovernmental institutions in Mexico and the United States.In this report, we detail construction of two Atlantis models, one representing the northern gulf in the year 2008 and another representing it in 1985. The 2008 model was based on the best current data and utilized new biomass estimates from scuba transects and trawl sampling, estimates of fisheries catch from port-level surveys, log books and community interviews, as well as other published and unpublished data. Polygon geometry was designed to represent ecologically important gradients and boundaries, reflect stock assessment and catch data organization, and demark existing and proposed spatial management areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17296787596138700376", "cites_id": ["17296787596138700376"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3847", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WN46J62ICvAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
