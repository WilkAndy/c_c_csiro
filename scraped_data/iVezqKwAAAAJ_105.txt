The use of a fixed TL per species in the calculation of TL-based indicators has been questioned, given that species\u2019 TLs vary with ontogeny, as well as over time and space. We conducted a model-based assessment of the performance of fixed TL-based indicators vs. variable TL-based indicators for tracking the effects of fishing pressure. This assessment considered three TL-based indicators (the trophic level of the landed catch (TLc), the marine trophic index (MTI) and the trophic level of the surveyed community (TLsc)), three fishing scenarios that targeted specific model groups (the low TL scenario (LTL), the high TL scenario (HTL) and a scenario encompassing broad-scale exploitation (ALL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4585386010899544142", "cites_id": ["4585386010899544142"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/1/158/2669566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Tni2UUiQoj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 12, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
