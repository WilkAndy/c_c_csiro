Risk equivalency is implicitly required under the USA Magnuson-Stevens Act, while in Australia it is an explicit component of the Australian Commonwealth Government\u2019s Harvest Strategy Policy. Risk equivalency is well understood, but few fisheries have attempted to implement it. The Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) is the only Australian fishery that has explicitly done so, albeit in a semi-arbitrary manner. Assessments and associated harvest strategies are placed into tiers from data-rich to data-limited. There are also meta-rules that control how much catch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3387300241476057619", "cites_id": ["3387300241476057619"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783616302168", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E3rGeJ8bAi8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
