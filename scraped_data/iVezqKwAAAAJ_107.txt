We refute the statements by showing that the assumptions pertaining to size-spectrum models discussed by Froese et al. are realistic and consistent. We further show that the assumption about density-dependence being described by a stock recruitment relationship is responsible for determining whether a peak in the cohort biomass of a population occurs late or early in life. Finally, we argue that there is indeed a constructive role for a wide suite of ecosystem models to evaluate fishing strategies in an ecosystem context."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11383512687846057088", "cites_id": ["11383512687846057088"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/73/6/1651/2458714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gGQ3J3pc-p0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
