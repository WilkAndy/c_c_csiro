The most widely adopted marine indicator is mean trophic level (MTL) from catches, intended to detect shifts from high-trophic-level predators to low-trophic-level invertebrates and plankton-feeders,,. This indicator underpins reported trends in human impacts, declining when predators collapse (\u201cfishing down marine food webs\u201d) and when low-trophic-level fisheries expand (\u201cfishing through marine food webs\u201d). The assumption is that catch MTL measures changes in ecosystem MTL and biodiversity,. Here we combine model predictions with global assessments of MTL from catches, trawl surveys and fisheries stock assessments and find that catch MTL does not reliably predict changes in marine ecosystems. Instead, catch MTL trends often diverge from ecosystem MTL trends obtained from surveys \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 470, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16746333755184700097", "cites_id": ["16746333755184700097"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09528", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wdrqD9PtZugJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 36, "2012": 49, "2013": 43, "2014": 59, "2015": 39, "2016": 37, "2017": 39, "2018": 32, "2019": 31, "2020": 22, "2021": 38, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
