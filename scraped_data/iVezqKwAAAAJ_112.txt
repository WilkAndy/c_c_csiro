In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multi-species size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15281390418808371570", "cites_id": ["15281390418808371570"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19304005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cnkhI59nEtQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
