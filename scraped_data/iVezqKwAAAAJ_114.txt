To date however climate policy discourse has largely overlooked the conservation of existing C stored in mountain grasslands and shrublands. These ecosystems provide critical ecological goods and services to humanity yet are increasingly at risk from anthropogenic stressors including agricultural intensification, mining and climate change. The absence of a global estimate for these C stocks is likely to be one reason for their exclusion from climate change policy discussions, both on a political and scientific basis. This represents a missed opportunity in two respects: firstly, by conserving and restoring existing C stocks the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10395158082594405138", "cites_id": ["10395158082594405138"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EvsRQTMFQ5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
