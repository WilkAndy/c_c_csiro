A key challenge in developing and applying ecosystem models that are able to provide robust predictions for management is to accurately represent the structure and dynamics of food webs. Ecosystem models vary in complexity and formulation and there is no set method routinely used to evaluate the skill of a model to correctly represent food web characteristics. One approach for evaluation is the comparison of modelled food web attributes with measures of stable isotope composition of taxa. While this approach has been used in some studies, its full potential has not been realised. Critically, directly modelling the assumed underlying processes that give rise to stable isotope signatures in ecosystem models has only just begun to be explored \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=23502318469426765", "cites_id": ["23502318469426765"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-019-09552-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ta7E7zt_UwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
