Human responses to these changes are complex, but may result in reduced government investments in regulation, resource management, monitoring and enforcement. Moreover, a lack of peoples\u2019 experience of climate change may drive some towards attributing the symptoms of climate change to more familiar causes such as management failure. Taken together, we anticipate that management could become weaker and less effective as climate change continues. Using diverse case studies, including the decline of coral reefs, coastal defences from flooding, shifting fish stocks and the emergence of new shipping opportunities in the Arctic, we argue that human interests are better served by increased investments in resource management. But greater government investment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8142677052454693349", "cites_id": ["8142677052454693349"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13698", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5WlJMKOZAHEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
