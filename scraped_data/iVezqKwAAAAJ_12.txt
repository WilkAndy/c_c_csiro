While many of these are taking the form of generic modelling frameworks, no one approach defines end-to-end ecosystem modelling. There is a wide range of scales, resolutions, forcings, components and represented processes. Examples drawn from existing models can be used to give guidance on best practice approaches for creating end-to-end models. In particular, it is clear that defaulting to the finest resolution and greatest complexity in all the dimensions (e.g. spatial, temporal, taxonomic, process detail) is not beneficial. There is also a lot of value, during model development and implementation, in trying different model types, assumptions and formulations; there is no one \u201cbest\u201d model. Maintaining a diversity of approaches is important given that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 449, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=399625456498615509", "cites_id": ["399625456498615509"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796309003509", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1aTNQTzBiwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 17, "2012": 30, "2013": 42, "2014": 39, "2015": 46, "2016": 37, "2017": 39, "2018": 32, "2019": 56, "2020": 38, "2021": 24, "2022": 31, "2023": 10}}
