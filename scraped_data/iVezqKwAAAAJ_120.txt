Consequently, the quality and type of assessments can also vary substantially. However, all species, especially those that are targeted, need to be managed. Several jurisdictions have developed hierarchical tier systems that categorize stocks based on, for example, the data available for assessment purposes and/or the extent to which quantities on which management advice is based can be estimated. Four case\u2010studies (Australia's Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery, the USA west coast groundfishery, the USA Alaskan crab fishery and EU fisheries) are used to contrast the types of hierarchical tier systems available, and to assess the extent to which each system constrains risk to be equivalent among the tiers (termed risk equivalency). Only the Australian system explicitly aims to achieve risk equivalency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4398944845479710503", "cites_id": ["4398944845479710503"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J49axQcxDD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
