One such stressor is ocean acidification, a result of increasing carbon emissions. Most research on biological impacts of ocean acidification has focused on the responses of an individual species or life stage. Yet, understanding how changes scale from species to ecosystems, and the services they provide, is critical to managing fisheries and setting research priorities. Here we use an ecosystem model, which is forced by oceanographic projections and also coupled to an economic input-output model, to quantify biological responses to ocean acidification in six coastal regions from Vancouver Island, Canada to Baja California, Mexico and economic responses at 17 ports on the US west coast. This model is intended to explore one possible future of how ocean acidification may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3503672453398893456", "cites_id": ["3503672453398893456"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018301856", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kJMpeoiLnzAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
