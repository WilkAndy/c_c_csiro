Following its establishment in 1982, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has managed the ecosystems of the high seas of the Southern Ocean. CCAMLR pioneered the ecosystem approach to resource management, took action on the problem of sea bird by-catch, and has established measures to combat illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. CCAMLR is seen as an example of best practice in managing marine resources in international waters. At the same time, CCAMLR's challenges arise in the balance between \u2018fishing\u2019 and \u2018conservation\u2019 interests; for example in the current debates over climate change and marine protected areas in the Southern Ocean. In each of these examples, CCAMLR's consensus-based decision-making process has been a central element in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2032272340846495471", "cites_id": ["2032272340846495471"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16304389", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:78YBM-0UNBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
