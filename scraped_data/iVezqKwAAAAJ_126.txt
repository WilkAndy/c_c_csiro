Where a previous study evaluated quantitatively a theoretical situation in which all regulations are perfectly followed, this article compares a suite of recently proposed ecosystem-based management (EBM) policies against the expected benefits of full enforcement of current regulations. Policies evaluated include no-take marine protected areas (MPAs), breeding period closures, changes in hook size and fishing effort, and gear-specific spatial closures. No-take MPAs yield ecological benefits over a wide range of MPA sizes and characteristics, but do not increase overall catch. Seasonal closures are effective at reducing overfishing for the depleted leopard grouper \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3128073927716355908", "cites_id": ["3128073927716355908"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X12000607", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RL-x_KkmaSsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
