These have been evaluated using simulation frameworks, including management strategy evaluation (MSE), but few studies have considered the full spectrum from data-rich to data-limited strategies, in the context of the risk-cost-catch trade-off. This involves evaluating whether the cost of implementing a HS, the risk to the resource and catch taken from the resource have been appropriately balanced, given the value of the resource. HSs implemented for Australian Commonwealth fisheries were placed in eight tiers, ranging from data-rich to data-limited, and their performance evaluated using an MSE based on a full end-to-end ecosystem model. Generally, the risk to the resource increased as fewer data were available, due to biases in the assessments and slow response times \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10687337045212767647", "cites_id": ["10687337045212767647"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/3/670/2741995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n6XHLmsMUZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
