To date, there have been limited attempts to couple the two sets of processes in dynamic models for coral reefs, and these attempts are confined to reef systems in developed countries. We present an approach to coupling existing biophysical and socioeconomic models for coral reef systems in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. The biophysical model is multiscale, using dynamic equations to capture local-scale ecological processes on individual reefs, with reefs connected at regional scales by the ocean transport of larval propagules. The agent-based socioeconomic model simulates changes in tourism, fisheries, and urbanization in the Quintana Roo region. Despite differences in the formulation and currencies of the two models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3127843458892847403", "cites_id": ["3127843458892847403"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26268951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K1lWyA1VaCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
