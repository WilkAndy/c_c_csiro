This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the \u201c6-S\u201d selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 402, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5098266492912060240", "cites_id": ["5098266492912060240"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0912771107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UMdMEF2uwEYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 18, "2012": 29, "2013": 34, "2014": 25, "2015": 38, "2016": 51, "2017": 30, "2018": 35, "2019": 41, "2020": 34, "2021": 24, "2022": 23, "2023": 13}}
