The continued promulgation of a century\u2010old management approach (i.e., single species maximum sustainable yield), despite decades of scientific warnings regarding its flaws, highlights how fisheries management and science can be constrained by path dependency and psychological traps. Major disruptions to the functioning of fisheries created by climate and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (COVID\u201019) present an opportunity to take a step back and introduce alternative approaches more appropriate to the extant conditions in the majority of global fisheries. This reset point, in combination with a proliferation of cheaper technological options, provides the opportunity for fisheries in emerging economies to reach a sustainable position without \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12288476073541092492", "cites_id": ["12288476073541092492"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12537", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jMRNuuFviaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
