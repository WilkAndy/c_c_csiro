The Atlantis modelling framework is an end-to-end model that includes information and processes from the abiotic environment to the human component of a system. An application of Atlantis for the Benguela and Agulhas Currents was updated and validated against time series of biomass and catch (1990\u20132013). Five univariate skill metrics were used to evaluate model performance of biomass data of selected species. A sensitivity analysis, focused on the growth rate of small and large phytoplankton and large zooplankton, was conducted to evaluate the influence of these parameters on model outputs. A total of 26 alternative model parameterisations based on a variation of \u00b1 20% around the growth parameter of the selected groups were compared to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15173914500034369306", "cites_id": ["15173914500034369306"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380016305518", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GpeyyteSlNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
