The increasing awareness of the complexity of the interaction of human impacts has led to a demand for end-to-end (E2E) models that attempt to include all major processes in a single framework. These whole-of-system models are potentially very useful as numerical laboratories to explore the potential spectrum of responses from the interplay of anthropogenic effects. However, despite their limitations and early stage of development, the output of E2E models is under increasing social pressure to provide \u201csimple\u201d answers to highly complex problems. Here, we suggest some approaches that can be included in E2E models for considering the potential effects of complex interactions on community and ecosystem services. We show how assumptions and parameterizations made in existing E2E \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8794084460636165544", "cites_id": ["8794084460636165544"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/71/4/764/669093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qFUAUTndCnoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
