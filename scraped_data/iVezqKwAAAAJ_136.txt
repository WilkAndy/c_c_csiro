The future of coral reef systems at local, regional and global scales is highly uncertain, which poses a challenge to decision makers in designing appropriate strategies for managing human activities that affect reef resilience. Scenario analysis using simulation models can inform decision making by exploring possible futures under alternative management frameworks. Here, we use a spatially explicit, regional-scale simulation model for coral reefs in the Meso-American Reef system to explore the effects of multiple stressors and disturbances on reef state. Two complementary approaches to scenario analysis help to characterize potential reef responses to the combined impacts of climate and land-use change in the Meso-American Reef region.
