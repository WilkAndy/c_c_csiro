Understanding these trade-offs can help managers reconcile conflicting goals. An example is a set of bycatch reduction measures for the Critically Endangered vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus), in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita is an endemic species threatened with extinction by artisanal net bycatch within its limited range; in this area fisheries are the chief source of economic productivity.We analyze trade-offs between conservation of the vaquita and fisheries, using an end-to-end Atlantis ecosystem model for the Northern Gulf of California. Atlantis is a spatially-explicit model intended as a strategic tool to test alternative management strategies. We simulated increasingly restrictive fisheries regulations contained in the vaquita conservation plan: implementing progressively larger spatial management areas that exclude gillnets, shrimp driftnets and introduce a fishing gear that has no vaquita bycatch. We found that only the most extensive spatial management scenarios recovered the vaquita population above the threshold necessary to downlist the species from Critically Endangered. The scenario that excludes existing net gear from the 2008 area of vaquita distribution led to moderate decrease in net present value (US$ 42 million) relative to the best-performing scenario and a two-fold increase in the abundance of adult vaquita over the course of 30 years.Extended spatial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17723534009944457921", "cites_id": ["17723534009944457921"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042917", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wUJLW0ek9vUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
