Under the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), there is keen interest in providing insights into the evolution of exploited ecosystems using simple ecosystem indicators. Many nations have long-term scientific research surveys, originally driven by conventional approaches in fisheries assessment and management. The aim of this study is to address the practical concerns linked to current objectives of monitoring simple EAF indicators, using data from surveys that were not historically designed for the purpose. Based on the results of an expert survey designed to collect expert \u2026Jouffre, D., Borges, M. F., Bundy, A., Coll, M., Diallo, I., Fulton, E.
