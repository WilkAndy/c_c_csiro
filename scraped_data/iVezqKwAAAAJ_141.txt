We focused on the usage of the words in both the scientific literature and legal documents and show that the confusion stems from a misuse of the terms artisanal, small-scale, coastal and subsistence, and is further propagated by language barriers. Accepting the complexity and subtleties of each term, we developed a simple method based on rhetoric and within a transdisciplinary background, which allows the \u2018level\u2019 of artisanal fisheries between nations to be parameterised and compared."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2579596715935495632", "cites_id": ["2579596715935495632"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18309412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0HUZvYuRzCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
