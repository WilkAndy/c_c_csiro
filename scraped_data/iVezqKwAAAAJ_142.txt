While we have provided some information useful during model construction, this is not a comprehensive step-by-step recipe book on how to create a new model from scratch. We assume in many sections that you already have a somewhat operational Atlantis model that you want to use. The manual will also be useful for experienced users, because even experienced users often focus on the area of their interest and may not be thoroughly familiar with other aspects of the modelling tool. Finally, the manual will aim to provide starting points for developers of new Atlantis applications, but you will have to venture out and learn a lot more than what is covered in the manual."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13492635809977467189", "cites_id": ["13492635809977467189"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Asta-Audzijonyte-2/publication/324314797_Atlantis_User's_Guide_Part_I_General_Overview_Physics_Ecology/links/5acab4880f7e9bcd5198b335/Atlantis-Users-Guide-Part-I-General-Overview-Physics-Ecology.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NQFsOch4P7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
