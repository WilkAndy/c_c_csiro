While such models are appropriate for tactical issues such as quota setting, they typically omit explicit trophic interactions between different parts of the ecosystem. To successfully manage multiple fisheries in the same ecosystem, we need to understand how fishing one species may indirectly affect other species. In this paper, we used a simulation model of the southern Benguela ecosystem, built in the Atlantis framework, to explore fisheries interaction effects. We first measured the impact of fishing different stocks individually at FMSY, the hypothetical level of fishing effort which produces maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in a single-species modelling context. We then applied FMSY to all stocks simultaneously and compared the simultaneous yield with the sum of yields from the individual applications of F \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11540128281704283489", "cites_id": ["11540128281704283489"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/72/1/275/2804300", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YT1srYfFJqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
