The predictive accuracy of complex fisheries models developed to anticipate the effects of changing fishery regulations appears to depend on a solid understanding of the processes and feedback systems linking biological and physical information to resource user. Many fisher decisions are modelled in the human component of the models, including inertia, or location choice flexibility. We unpack a whole of ecosystem system model and explore how location choice flexibility in fleet behaviour (sticking to the same seasonal and spatial distribution of fishing) affects outcomes such as catches and income levels and variability. Our analysis shows that the interpretation is not straightforward, and the relationship \u2026van Putten, I. E., Gorton, R. J., Fulton, E. A., and Thebaud, O. 2013.
