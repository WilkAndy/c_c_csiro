It is the focus of major commercial and recreational fisheries and there is pressure to divert its freshwater inputs for agricultural and domestic uses. We used a spatial biogeochemical model to simulate the variability and evolution of this system on timescales from days to decades over the past half century. Like most tropical and subtropical estuaries, the Clarence River Estuary is strongly influenced by river discharge, sediment and nutrient loads. Given the high nutrient loads arriving from the upper catchment, plankton biomasses in the model were typically limited by flushing through the estuary channels. However, the longer residence times of the lagoons produced a profoundly different regime where higher zooplankton concentrations were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10765747667170245056", "cites_id": ["10765747667170245056"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v457/p43-66/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wDksw3aeZ5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
