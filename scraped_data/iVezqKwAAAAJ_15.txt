Many of the tools that will be needed to fulfil the requirements of these policies are still in an early stage of development. One such tool is trophic ecosystem modelling. These models have been put forward to aid system-level understanding and provide insight into the potential impacts of human activities. Despite this, there are many gaps in knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, little is known about the effect of the level of detail in a model on its performance. There has been some consideration of the effects of model formulation, as well as the effects of the physical, biological and chemical scope of multispecies and ecosystem models on their performance. A review of existing research indicates that there is a humped relationship between model detail \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 382, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6258062275383557896", "cites_id": ["6258062275383557896"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v253/p1-16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CH-Cmnsa2VYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 19, "2007": 10, "2008": 25, "2009": 23, "2010": 29, "2011": 29, "2012": 20, "2013": 25, "2014": 30, "2015": 28, "2016": 26, "2017": 20, "2018": 14, "2019": 17, "2020": 20, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
