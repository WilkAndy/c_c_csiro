While the effect of fishing on marine ecosystems has been widely explored, much less is known about the ecosystem effects of fish body size decrease. Here we used a marine ecosystem model to compare how fishing and small (< 0.1% yr-1) but continuous (50 yr) decreases in the average body sizes of 5 Australian demersal fish species affect ecosystem indicators, biomasses and diets of different species. We found that decreasing growth rate of the 5 species had similar and comparable impact as the introduction of fishing of these 5 species at fishing mortality rate of F= 0.2 yr-1. The same applied when impacts of decrease in size were compared to those of increasing fishing from F= 0.2 to F= 0.4. This suggests that declines in body size alone can lead to ecosystem responses similar in magnitude to those caused \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17094167687933885858", "cites_id": ["17094167687933885858"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v495/p219-231/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:on1CgvGuOu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
