However, species- or fishery-specific policies may lead to indirect consequences, positive or negative, for other species or fisheries. We use an Atlantis ecosystem model of the Northern Gulf of California to evaluate the effects of fisheries policies directed at reducing bycatch of vaquita (Phocoena sinus) on other species of conservation concern, priority target species, and metrics of ecosystem function and structure. Vaquita, a Critically Endangered porpoise endemic to the Upper Gulf of California, are frequently entangled by finfish gillnets and shrimp driftnets. We tested five fishery management scenarios, projected over 30 years (2008 to 2038), directed at vaquita conservation. The scenarios consider progressively larger spatial restrictions for finfish gillnets and shrimp driftnets. The most restrictive scenario resulted in the highest biomass of species of conservation concern; the scenario without any conservation measures in place resulted in the lowest. Vaquita experienced the largest population increase of any functional group; their biomass increased 2.7 times relative to initial (2008) levels under the most restrictive spatial closure scenario. Bycatch of sea lions, sea turtles, and totoaba decreased > 80% in shrimp driftnets and at least 20% in finfish gillnet fleets under spatial management. We found indirect effects on species and ecosystem function and structure as a result of vaquita management actions. Biomass and catch of forage fish declined, which could affect lower-trophic level fisheries, while other species such as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=544269657446811395", "cites_id": ["544269657446811395"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Awckql6ijQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
