We do so by comparing the original project plan to the actual project development and highlight the changes which can be more directly related to stakeholder engagement aided by the application of a logic model for program evaluation. The impact can be summarised into four broad classes: a) change in the actual project development; b) a measurable change in the network of interactions both stakeholders (which includes researchers); c) changes in how the computer model was developed and run; and d) changes in attitudes among stakeholders (including researchers). We discuss these changes, the way they have been detected and some lessons we learnt which may benefit future Management Strategy Evaluation projects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3917213727845930420", "cites_id": ["3917213727845930420"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/21335", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tFWKlSG9XDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
