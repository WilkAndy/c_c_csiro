The importance of the fisheries has led to progressive fisheries management and extensive monitoring of the ecosystem. However, fisheries management is mainly built on single species stock assessment models, and multi-species or ecological models are essential for building capacity around ecosystem-based fisheries management. This paper describes the first end-to-end model for the Icelandic waters using the Atlantis modeling framework. The modeled area is 1,600,000\u202fkm2, and covers the area from Greenland through Icelandic waters to the Faroe Islands. The ocean area was divided into 51 spatial boxes, each with multiple vertical layers. There were 52 functional groups in the model: 20 fish groups (8 at a species level), 5 groups of mammals, 1 seabird group, 16 invertebrates, 5 primary producers, 2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10063539318570950053", "cites_id": ["10063539318570950053"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783618301620", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pR2Z-rDfqIsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 7}}
