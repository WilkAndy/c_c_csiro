Predictive modeling can show how management can influence those dynamics and structures and the ecosystem services these systems provide. Many nations and intergovernmental organizations are advocating for ecosystem-based management, often with a specific emphasis to evaluate various future management strategies. Atlantis is an end-to-end ecosystem model that is well suited for this task and has so far been developed for more than 30 diverse marine ecosystems worldwide. To provide a better understanding of the current modeling work, elicit wider interest, and foster collaboration within the Atlantis community, the first international Atlantis Summit was convened in December 2015. The main outcomes from this workshop included a clearer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13688398593715493669", "cites_id": ["13688398593715493669"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380016301776", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JVteKv_19r0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
