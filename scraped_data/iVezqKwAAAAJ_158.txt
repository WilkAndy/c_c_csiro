However there are currently relatively few fishery and ecosystem models which take into account EBFM-related issues and associated ecological considerations. One such model is Atlantis, which has been used extensively in Australia to inform fishery management plans. Atlantis is a series of submodels (biological, geophysical, fishing, assessment, and management) and as a whole simulates a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) procedure which allows for qualitative comparisons of different management choices. We have parameterized Atlantis for the Northeast United States Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NEUS LME), including the major functional groups from an ecosystem perspective. We have also parameterized and simulated the physiographic dynamics of the ecosystem, as well as the most important fleets. Our goal was to recreate, at least in approximate terms, the biomass, catch, and effort trends in the NEUS LME from 1964 to the mid 2000s. Here we document this Atlantis application for the NEUS LME and describe the various levels of calibration to establish a reference base for future utilizations of this particular application of the Atlantis model that will evaluate different management strategies and their tradeoffs. Our preliminary results demonstrate that Atlantis can reasonably approximate time series and spatial distributions for the majority of main processes and state variables of the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3113292177233477941", "cites_id": ["3113292177233477941"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3963", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NQEBgr2iNCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
