To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (\u00b14% SD) under low emissions and 17% (\u00b111% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 \u00b0C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 362, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11280427427855918922", "cites_id": ["11280427427855918922"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1900194116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Sufst_ogjJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 13, "2020": 76, "2021": 109, "2022": 115, "2023": 46}}
