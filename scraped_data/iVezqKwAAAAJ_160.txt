Fisheries management is highly dependent on the stability or predictability of targeted fish populations. Oceanic changes occurring as a result of climate change will see continuing and potentially irreversible deviations from the conditions of fisheries past. These changes present challenges to fisheries management at all scales \u2013 from local to international \u2013 relating to food security, sustainability, and ecological integrity. Areas of measurably warmer ocean, or \u2018hotspots\u2019, are a very clear indicator of direct climate change effects. RFBs with hotspots in their areas of competence were chosen for this study. Three levels of institutional engagement were developed: Awareness of climate change; Learning about climate change; Action taken by the institutions. While 94% of institutions demonstrated awareness of climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4754423436321313490", "cites_id": ["4754423436321313490"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20309301", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0lK54ewa-0EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
