Bottom-up control of fish production has now been demonstrated in many regions of the world ocean (Ware, 2000) supporting the general approach of tracing pathways involved in the translation of primary production to fishery yields. Our ability to estimate primary production was revolutionized by Steeman-Nielsen's (1951) development and application of the 14C method, paving the way for elaboration of simple models of energy flow from the base of the food web through fish production.Earlier estimates of fishery production potential based on energetic principles were based on estimates of primary production over all phytoplankton size classes, inferred ecological transfer efficiencies from laboratory experiments and other observations, and observed or assumed levels of the mean trophic level of the catch. The general strategy was laid out by Kestevan and Holt (1955). Graham and Edwards (1962) provided an estimate of potential global fish yield of 115 kkt (106 mt) for bony (teleost) fishes supporting \u2018conventional\u2019fisheries using this method. In contrast, their estimate of potential yield based on extrapolations of catch histories in space and time was less than half this value at 55 kkt. Schaefer (1965), applying somewhat higher estimates of transfer efficiencies, estimated the potential yield to be on the order of 200 kkt. Ricker (1969) followed with a projection of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10999449551360721096", "cites_id": ["10999449551360721096"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Rosenberg-8/publication/296331458_Fishery_production_potential_of_large_marine_ecosystems_A_prototype_analysis/links/570d0af008aec783ddcda817/Fishery-production-potential-of-large-marine-ecosystems-A-prototype-analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yICv4RblpZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
