This provides an overview of how these models interact, the different roles they cover, how they fit into a full decision making process and what we learnt about the stakeholders involved in our project via their use. When modelling is explicitly used to address socio-ecological issues, the key determinant of success is whether the models, their results and recommendations are taken up by stakeholders; such uptake in turn depends on addressing stakeholders\u2019 concerns, on engaging them in the project, on ensuring they feel ownership of the decision process at large, and that they understand and trust the modelling effort. This observation has guided our approach and has resulted in treating \u2018building a model\u2019as the catalyst, rather than the final aim, of the process. In other words, extensive interactions in order to introduce, showcase, discuss and tune the model used for final decision making have represented both a requirement and an opportunity to ensure (i) model relevance,(ii) its acceptance,(iii) that all information available in the stakeholder team was accounted for and (iv) that stakeholders holding different levels of understanding of modelling, what it does and what it can provide to decision-making could develop an informed opinion on its use. To fulfil these roles we developed five broad classes of models: conceptual models, toy-models, single system models, shuttle-models and a full-system model. In conceptual models the main drivers of a system are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6863877446058599793", "cites_id": ["6863877446058599793"], "pub_url": "https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworks2011/765/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cWUjuitkQV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
