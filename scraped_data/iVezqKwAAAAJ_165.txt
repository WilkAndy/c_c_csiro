Several approaches for future projection exist but these have never been compared systematically to assess their variability. We conducted standardized ensemble projections including 6 global fisheries and marine ecosystem models, forced with 2 Earth-system models and 4 emission scenarios in a fished and unfished ocean, to derive average trends and associated uncertainties. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (\u00b14%) under low and 17% (\u00b111%) under high emissions by 2100, primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production. These climate-change effects were slightly weaker for larger animals and in a fished ocean. Considerable regional variation ranged from strong biomass increases in high latitudes to strong decreases in mid-low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to differences among ecosystem or Earth-system models were similar, suggesting equal need for model improvement. Our ensemble projections provide the most comprehensive outlook on potential climate-driven ecological changes in the ocean to date. Realized future trends will largely depend on how fisheries and management adapt to these changes in a changing climate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15664925811517909796", "cites_id": ["15664925811517909796"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/467175.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JGtffAf_ZNkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
