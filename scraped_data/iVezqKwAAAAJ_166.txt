Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socio-ecological systems. The models were used to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13011078497617467793", "cites_id": ["13011078497617467793"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064518301139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kVk2O_WikLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
