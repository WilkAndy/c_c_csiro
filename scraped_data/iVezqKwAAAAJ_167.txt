Using an ecosystem modelling approach, we explored the trade-offs between invertebrate catches and their impacts on the associated ecosystem on the south coast of Wellington, New Zealand. We simulated exploitation of lobster (Jasus edwardsii), abalone (Haliotis australis, H. iris), and sea urchin (Evechinus chloroticus) over a range of depletion levels\u2014from no depletion to local extinction\u2014to estimate changes in target catches and associated effects on other species groups, trophic levels, and benthic and pelagic components. Exploitation of lobster showed the strongest ecosystem effects, followed by abalone and urchin. In all three fisheries, the current exploitation rate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7038389952196919944", "cites_id": ["7038389952196919944"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/72/5/1380/772875", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iEJg215irWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
