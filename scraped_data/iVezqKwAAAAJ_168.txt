Using generalized additive models (GAMs) fitted to outputs from a multi-ecosystem, multi-model simulation experiment, we investigated 14 major ecological indicators across ten marine ecosystems about their responses to fishing pressure under: (i) three different fishing strategies (focusing on low-, high-, or all-trophic-level taxa); and (ii) four different scenarios of directional or random primary productivity change, a proxy for environmental change. From this work, we draw four major conclusions: (i) responses of indicators to fishing mortality in shapes, directions, and thresholds depend on the fishing strategies considered; (ii) most of the indicators demonstrate decreasing trends with increasing fishing mortality, with a few exceptions depending on the type of fishing strategy; (iii) most of the indicators respond to fishing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8771069176159369374", "cites_id": ["8771069176159369374"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/77/4/1516/5575246", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nnhb0fEYuXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
