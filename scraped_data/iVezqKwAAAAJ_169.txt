Such changes could lead to new feeding interactions and alter stock productivity, introducing new levels of uncertainty in fisheries management. We use a marine ecosystem model parameterized for Southeast Australia to explore how reductions (up to 6% in 50 years) in size-at-age of fished species affect stock recovery after an implementation of a fishing moratorium. We show that reduction in body size can greatly elevate predation mortality and lower the post-fishing biomass of affected species. In our simulations, the recovery period after the fishing moratorium was characterized by two phases. In the initial readjustment phase, the ecosystem dynamics was largely determined by the rapid changes in the biomasses of recovering species and changes in body size had negligible effects. In contrast, fish body sizes had the major impact on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14034194589104977997", "cites_id": ["14034194589104977997"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/72/3/782/693470", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TbhPWJ95w8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
