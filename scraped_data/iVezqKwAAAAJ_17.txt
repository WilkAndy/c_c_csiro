Quantitative models to support fisheries decision\u2010making may be either strategic (\u2018big picture\u2019, direction\u2010setting and contextual) or tactical (focused on management actions on short timescales), with some strategic models informing the development of tactical models. We describe and review \u2018Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments\u2019 (MICE) that have a tactical focus, including use as ecosystem assessment tools. MICE are context\u2010 and question\u2010driven and limit complexity by restricting the focus to those components of the ecosystem needed to address the main effects of the management question under consideration. Stakeholder participation and dialogue is an integral part of this process. MICE estimate parameters through fitting to data, use statistical diagnostic tools to evaluate model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 337, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3070018595077009379", "cites_id": ["3070018595077009379"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2012.00488.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:469ohaXlmioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 16, "2015": 27, "2016": 45, "2017": 39, "2018": 35, "2019": 49, "2020": 36, "2021": 36, "2022": 37, "2023": 11}}
