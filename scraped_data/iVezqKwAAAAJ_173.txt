Each stage of the approach is controlled by a Graphical User Interface which allows a team of non-expert modellers to compare the outcomes of multiple model simulations and to decide what further simulation is needed. A distinguishing feature of the method is that it allows the goal of the management strategies to arise as a result of the interaction between the user and the model, rather than being defined a priori, as well as to change during the process in response to the information and the insight such modelling may provide. We envisage that a management team, rather than a single user, may also employ the method as an avenue for communication, in order to discuss the potentially conflicting aspects of different model outcomes along the path to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2118802133551741582", "cites_id": ["2118802133551741582"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815210000551", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jvqwh1B_Zx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
