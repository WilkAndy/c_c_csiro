Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological and socio-economic predictions with the modeller\u2019s experience and available knowledge of the modelled system largely determining the success of model calibration. Here we provide an overview of best practices when calibrating an Atlantis marine ecosystem model, a widely adopted framework that includes the parameters and processes comprised in many different ecosystem models. We highlight the importance of understanding the model structure and data sources of the modelled system. We then focus on several model outputs (biomass trajectories, age distributions, condition at age, realised diet proportions, and spatial maps) and describe diagnostic routines that can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15182892534644716080", "cites_id": ["15182892534644716080"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380019303308", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MLJtXlF4tNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
