Characterizing temporal variability in coral reef fauna is critical for predicting how reef ecosystems will be impacted by environmental change. Sponges are an ecologically important component of coral reefs, yet descriptions of temporal dynamics of multi-species sponge assemblages are scarce. We studied temporal changes in abundance and biodiversity of an Indonesian coral reef sponge assemblage over 13 yr (2005-2017). Mean (\u00b1SE) sponge abundance (sponge patches m-2) initially increased from 124.06\u00b18.46 to 183.73\u00b112.12 in 2005-2007 (p< 0.001), declined to 66.53\u00b110.62 in 2007-2014 (p< 0.001), and increased to 105.87\u00b115.42 in 2014-2017 (p< 0.001). These patterns in sponge abundance did not depend on water temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4192920063136942024", "cites_id": ["4192920063136942024"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v620/p63-76/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yMfiFpU-MDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
