We use a spatially explicit multi-scale model of a coral reef system to explore four aspects of model sensitivity and uncertainty: (i) sensitivity to initial conditions; (ii) sensitivity to parameter values; (iii) sensitivity to spatio-temporal resolution; and (iv) the effects of uncertainty about spatio-temporal variability of ecological processes on the shape of distributions of model predictions. We use reef community composition, visualized in multivariate space, as a response variable. This approach provides an easily interpretable representation of changes in reef community composition under different parameter conditions and spatio-temporal resolutions. It is also a useful means to visualize distributions of model outcomes under differing assumptions about the nature of variability in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6224066059897340256", "cites_id": ["6224066059897340256"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438001100384X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YAG_3hpTYFYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
