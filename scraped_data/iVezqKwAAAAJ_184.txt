Although stock assessments and indicators assist in evaluating lobster fisheries, ecosystem effects are largely unknown, hindering ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). We employed ecosystem models for the Cook Strait, New Zealand and western Scotian Shelf, Nova Scotia, Canada, to evaluate trade-offs between catches and ecosystem impacts in lobster fisheries from single- and multi-species perspectives. We ran simulations to independently determine exploitation rates that produced maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for lobster, and for all fished groups. We then ran simulations using these MSY exploitation rates simultaneously, and simulations to maximize multi-species MSY (MMSY). Our results indicate that current lobster exploitation rates in both regions are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7606267705152888968", "cites_id": ["7606267705152888968"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/1/146/2669549", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iOApmC3kjmkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
