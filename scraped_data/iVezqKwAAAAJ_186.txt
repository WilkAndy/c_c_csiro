This survey was repeated 20 years later with the same vessel and using similar protocols. Comparison of the survey results suggested that the overall fish biomass in the survey area had substantially decreased after 20 years. We have implemented an ecosystem model using the Atlantis framework to (1) emulate the evolution of the shelf ecosystems from 1976 to 1996 and (2) explore the effects of alternative fishing pressures on those ecosystems. We have been able to emulate the observed decline of most of the commercial groups of fish species in the Offshore Trawl Fishery, including sharks, and our results confirmed that fishing pressure was the most important cause of these observed changes.
