Nevertheless, it is a necessary step for considering many management issues pertaining to shelf and coastal systems. In this paper, we explore one method of modeling large areas with a focus at a range of scales. We develop an ecosystem model that can be used for strategic management decision support by modeling the waters off southeastern Australia using a polygon telescoping approach, which incorporates fine\u2010scale detail at the coastal zone, increasing in scale to a very coarse scale in the offshore areas. This telescoping technique is a useful tool for incorporating a wide range of habitats at different scales into a single model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11909816542547772598", "cites_id": ["11909816542547772598"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1939-7445.2011.00094.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:toShZgsrSKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
