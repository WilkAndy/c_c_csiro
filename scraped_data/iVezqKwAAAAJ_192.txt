We devised a novel approach to identify such species. We constructed annual interaction\u2010effect networks (IENs) of the simulated changes in biomass between species of the southeastern Australian marine system. Each annual IEN was composed of the species linked by either an additive (sum of the individual stressor response), synergistic (lower biomass compared with additive effects), or antagonistic (greater biomass compared with additive effects) response to the interaction effect of ocean warming, ocean acidification, and fisheries. Structurally, over the simulation period, the number of species and links in the synergistic IENs increased and the network structure became more stable. The stability of the antagonistic IENs decreased and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15513428945620685999", "cites_id": ["15513428945620685999"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r9T7r27FStcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
