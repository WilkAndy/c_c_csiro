However, there is currently little understanding of how accounting for unreported catches (e.g. small-scale and illegal fisheries, bycatch and discards) influences functional diversity trends in global fisheries. We explored how diversity estimates varied among reported and unreported components of catch in 2010, and found these components had distinct functional fingerprints. Incorporating unreported catches had little impact on global-scale functional diversity patterns. However, at smaller, management-relevant scales, the effects of incorporating unreported catches were large (changes in functional diversity of up to 46%). Our results suggest there is greater uncertainty about the risks to ecosystem integrity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9638962398833870048", "cites_id": ["9638962398833870048"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-10723-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4ATXeTt5xIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
