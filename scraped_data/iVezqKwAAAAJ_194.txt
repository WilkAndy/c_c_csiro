Ward et al.(2014) estimated that between 60.5 Pg C and 82.8 Pg of C was stored across 64 mountain countries in the year 2000 (excluding Antarctica). This C pool plays an important role in international-level carbon budgets and climate regulation, and has a substantial economic value (Ward et al., 2015). Likewise, any net sequestration of CO 2 by MGS over a period of time will also have an economic benefit to society through mitigating climate change.Ecological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=578356095499247764", "cites_id": ["578356095499247764"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800916305493", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lCDq-c27BggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
