Because EBM defines management strategies for entire systems, the approach accounts for interactions among ecosystem components and sectors, seeks to identify cumulative impacts of multiple sectors, and includes human responses as an integral part of the system (Levin et al., 2009).Integrating scientific information at a variety of scales to provide decision-makers with information concerning societal trade-offs requires computationally intensive, end-to-end modeling techniques. Of such techniques, Atlantis (Fulton et al., 2003; Fulton et al., 2004a) was identified by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (Plag\u00e1nyi, 2007) as one of the best ecosystem models, particularly for evaluating management strategies. The approach has been a cornerstone in the development of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA/NMFS) Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) approach for fisheries management (Levin et al., 2009; Levin and Schwing, 2011). Atlantis has been used to advise decision-making for nearly a decade in Australia and has been applied in multiple applications in the US as well (Brand et al., 2007; Horne et al., 2010; Link et al., 2010; Fulton et al. 2011)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14194146382973267594", "cites_id": ["14194146382973267594"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17357/noaa_17357_DS1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:im4Ed-68-8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
