It builds upon the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report, the three Special Reports of the Sixth Assessment cycle:\u2018Global Warming of 1.5 C. An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1. 5)\u2019;\u2018Climate Change and Land: An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL)\u2019;\u2018IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)\u2019, and the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.The report recognizes the interactions of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies, and integrates knowledge more strongly across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences than earlier IPCC assessments. The assessment of climate change impacts and risks as well as adaptation is set against concurrently unfolding non-climatic global trends eg, biodiversity loss, overall unsustainable consumption of natural resources, land and ecosystem degradation, rapid urbanisation, human demographic shifts, social and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 859, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16200025026143361999,8944092054547703390", "cites_id": ["16200025026143361999", "8944092054547703390"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sina-Ayanlade/publication/362431678_Climate_Change_2022_Impacts_Adaptation_and_Vulnerability_Working_Group_II_Contribution_to_the_Sixth_Assessment_Report_of_the_Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change/links/62ea52343c0ea87887793180/Climate-Change-2022-Impacts-Adaptation-and-Vulnerability-Working-Group-II-Contribution-to-the-Sixth-Assessment-Report-of-the-Intergovernmental-Panel-on-Climate-Change.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z5u2C-4M0uAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 353, "2023": 445}}
