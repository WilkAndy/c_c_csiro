SIMA is built upon an integrated system of biophysical production data, catchment and coastal-marine models, visualisation, reporting and risk-based decision support tools. This communication briefly describes the SIMA architecture and components and provides examples of applications of how it can be used to inform policy and management decisions, and discusses challenges and key learnings and considers future developments and applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4596179842908514464", "cites_id": ["4596179842908514464"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1755876X.2019.1636606", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oGhfLDfpyD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
