The history of commercial fishing in South East Australia is relatively recent and thus easier to document. Our aim is to reconstruct such history and to use this information to understand general patterns and consequences of fishing exploitation. Intense exploitation of marine resources arrived in South East Australia with European colonization in the early 1800s, and unregulated sealing, whaling and oyster dredging resulted in the first documented significant impact on local marine populations. Exploitation extended to demersal resources in 1915 when the trawl fishery developed. Between the early 1800s and the 1980s, some of the exploited stocks collapsed, but fishing moved further offshore and in deeper waters as technology improved and new resources became available or were discovered. This phase of fisheries expansion masked the unsustainable nature of some fishing industries, such as trawling and whaling, and postponed the need for management regulations. From the 1990s onward, an increasing awareness of the depleted nature of some fisheries led to the establishment of management strategies aiming at a more sustainable exploitation of target stocks and, from the mid-2000s onwards, management strategies were revised and improved to better address the effect of fishing on multiple components of marine ecosystems. This led to the recovery of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13185488413892339051", "cites_id": ["13185488413892339051"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00145/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a-UUTNpD_LYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
