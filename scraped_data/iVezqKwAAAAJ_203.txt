Ensuring a participatory process is very important (in our experience, perhaps the most important part of the approach), by working closely with all major user or interest groups in the system to elicit their understanding, objectives and options. Without the participatory angle, there is a significant risk of the work being ignored or used inappropriately. Successful and effective participatory engagement can, however, be quite challenging and involves skills and time commitments not necessarily appreciated by many scientists. Fortunately, robust methods for this kind of work do exist. In this chapter, based on experience primarily gained in fisheries and multiple-use coastal management, we will describe the good and the bad of one such approach\u2013management strategy evaluation.Natural resource management, such as fisheries, is inherently complex, as it involves a resource that is a national (or even global) public asset, yet (often) entrusted to a few owners (Gordon 1954; Beddington et al. 2007). This means that individual business objectives, such as maximising profits, need to be traded against the medium-term impacts of fishing on the ecosystem and inter-generational equity for a sustainable environment (Grafton et al. 2007; Costello et al. 2008). Defining objectives and trade-offs for fisheries management is, therefore, often extremely complex and politically sensitive (Gislason et al. 2000; Mardle and Pascoe 2002; Hilborn 2007). The complexity and sensitivity only increase as more cross-sectoral and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9184266565408903473", "cites_id": ["9184266565408903473"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=F9UlDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA19&dq=info:MdGx6ccRdX8J:scholar.google.com&ots=tE7IdQoxnR&sig=qK4Vj26cNYTpM09h-xGkesyUzbg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MdGx6ccRdX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2}}
