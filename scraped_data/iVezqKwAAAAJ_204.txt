It brought a group of scientists, from across a range of disciplines, together to consider what science could contribute to thinking about Australia\u2019s possible futures. In a 5-day workshop, participants considered four broad topics: whether it is possible to define what a \u201csocially sustainable\u201d Australia might look like; how Australia could be resilient to future shocks; how mathematical models could be used to help understand social, economic and environmental systems and how they might develop in the future; and, what scenarios for Australia\u2019s future emerge from these discussions. Constructive conclusions emerged for the first three topics, but those charged with developing the scenarios struck some interesting problems (Raupach et al, 2013). They agreed on a range of, sometimes contradictory, assumptions that Australians seem to make and a range of key factors that might affect the nation. But they had difficulty agreeing on what particular issues the scenarios should focus on. Some members of the group felt that our main aim should be to lay out the potential challenges of the future from the perspectives of scientists (especially challenges associated with bio-physical processes like climate change and energy generation) so that Australians could see clearly what they might face. Others agreed that this was important, but thought that something more was needed. They observed that people learn best when allowed to explore information and situations for themselves. They argued that we need a way to help Australians from all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17662175637925706733", "cites_id": ["17662175637925706733"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d933fa9119ff0babcc34313bc4c88336c808e5bb", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7bseGyqnHPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
