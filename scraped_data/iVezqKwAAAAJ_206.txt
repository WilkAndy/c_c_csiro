It forms part of a broader collaborative study between CSIRO and the NSW Department of Primary Industries on ecologically sustainable development of the regional marine and estuarine resources of NSW.This component of the study aimed to develop tools that could help address issues emerging along the NSW coast, particularly related to the ecological impacts of fisheries and the potential role of specific harvest strategies or conservation strategies. The tool that was adopted for these purposes was the Atlantis model incorporating:(i) a deterministic ecosystem model incorporating physical, biogeochemical, and higher trophic level components and processes;"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10818075158864337882", "cites_id": ["10818075158864337882"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43472164/Ecologically_sustainable_development_of_20160307-7362-18rdror.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2huWVQqGIZYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
