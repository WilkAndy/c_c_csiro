To this end an ecosystem model of a generalised temperate bay, Bay Model 2 (BM2), was constructed. It is a trophically diverse biogeochemical model built using the functional groups from another ecosystem model, the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model (IGBEM) and the general framework from a model of Port Phillip Bay (PPB), Australia. BM2 captures the essential features of real marine systems, it is also capable of reproducing realistic levels of biomass and conforms with known ecological relationships. The model\u2019s performance is not as good for some of the poorly known groups (like infauna) or when environmental conditions undergo extreme change. Despite this, the overall performance of BM2 indicated, it is as capable of representing systems as accurately as more physiologically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 215, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17060522129035750267", "cites_id": ["17060522129035750267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380003004253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e-vdX3wmw-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 15, "2011": 16, "2012": 12, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 20, "2017": 15, "2018": 16, "2019": 14, "2020": 19, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
