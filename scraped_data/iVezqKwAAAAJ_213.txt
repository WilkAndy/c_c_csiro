However, the extent to which fishing\u2010induced evolution is shaping ecosystems remains debated. This is in part because it is challenging to disentangle fishing from other selective forces (e.g., size\u2010structured predation and cannibalism) in complex ecosystems undergoing rapid change. Changes in maturation size from fishing and predation have previously been explored with multi\u2010species physiologically structured models but assumed separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales. To assess the eco\u2010evolutionary impact of fishing and predation at the same timescale, we developed a stochastic physiologically size\u2010structured food\u2010web model, where new phenotypes are introduced randomly through time enabling dynamic simulation of species' relative maturation sizes under different types of selection \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14760426560780399476", "cites_id": ["14760426560780399476"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dHOOwMCR18wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
