In the case of socioeconomically and biologically important coral reef ecosystems, models have been used to address important questions regarding the effects of human impacts on their ecological dynamics and to inform management approaches. However, few of the models integrate benthic and fish dynamics with the influence of external anthropogenic stressors, and virtually none is available as a user-friendly platform for non-scientist managers to easily access. We propose a new ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous stressors on coral reef ecosystems which includes a dynamic representation of benthic and fish spatial processes, linked by their ecological feedbacks. SEAMANCORE is a two-dimensional model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=451793584749226226", "cites_id": ["451793584749226226"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380018301996", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8ijHIt8XRQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
