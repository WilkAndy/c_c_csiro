The results of this study should improve effectiveness and efficiency of spatial management, through development of better performance assessment methods. More importantly, is should lead to greater uptake of spatial management approaches to achieve ESD for marine resources and ecosystems. An important outcome of the project has been that our model (Atlantis-SM) and what we have learned from its development and application, provides a \"transportable\" framework for developing performance measures. The basic approach, both the telescoping treatment of habitats in and around spatial closures and the management strategy evaluation framework for representing the estimation of indicators, can be applied to other systems via new implementations of the Atlantis framework. However, even without going that far, it is possible to take the lessons learnt in this case to other systems. In particular it contributes to the policy debate around the implementation of EBM. It highlights the potential for monitoring for EBM performance to be far from simple. Monitoring schemes with small spatial coverage or infrequent temporal repetition (on the order of 3-5 years or more) had no power to rapidly detect changes at the broader system level. In addition, the finding that there is likely to be system specific reference points is particularly important, as the tendency within the literature has been to try and find generic rules and approaches for universal application and broad scale comparisons.
