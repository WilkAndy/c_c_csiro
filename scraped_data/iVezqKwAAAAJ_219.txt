Using expert knowledge elicitation, we explored interactions among seven variables representing Earth system processes relevant to food production, identifying many interactions little explored in Earth system literature. We found that green water and land system change affect other Earth system processes strongly, while land, freshwater and ocean components of biosphere integrity are the most impacted by other Earth system processes, most notably blue water and biogeochemical flows. We also mapped a complex network of mechanisms mediating these interactions and created a future research prioritization scheme based on interaction strengths and existing knowledge gaps. Our study improves the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16629988675252310886", "cites_id": ["16629988675252310886"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00940-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZtMuN5eWyeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
