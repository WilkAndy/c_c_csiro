MSY is not being advocated as a target reference point but enables a level of consistency across species and/or jurisdictions with different reference points. MSY estimates were obtained for 290 species/stocks that comprised 84% of annual landings. 75% of the estimates were computed using methods applied specifically for this study, aided by an assessment framework, and supporting software. The catch-MSY method was used extensively given the lack of formal assessments for many species, and the limitations of taking this approach are discussed. The results indicated that potential production could be more than double the current national catch (an increase over current catches of about 124%), but potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=466778119162711705", "cites_id": ["466778119162711705"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20310034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mU6e7TlUegYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
