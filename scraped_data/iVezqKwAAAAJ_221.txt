In addition, climate change and ocean acidification are fundamentally changing ocean conditions. Effective conservation will entail synthesizing information across a broad range of disciplines, dealing with nonstationary complexity and a high degree of uncertainty. Modeling is a valuable tool for synthesizing and analyzing this complexity, as well as simulating alternative scenarios that would be impossible to test empirically. We provide several examples of how socioecological frameworks and two-way dynamic feedbacks can be incorporated into marine conservation models and decision support.
