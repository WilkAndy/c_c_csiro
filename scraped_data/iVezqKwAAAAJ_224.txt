Both models contain jack mackerel as a modelled group. These models were used to explore the plausibility of a range of alternative spawning biomass estimates for the stock.Both models indicated that values of 20,000-\u201030,000 t are implausibly low given the ecology captured in the models. The simulations run at this level are either numerically impossible(leading to numerical instability in Atlantis, or an imbalance in EwE) that could only be remedied by substantial restructuring of the models. Such large scale restructuring is not consistent with existing data sets. Although as these data sets are now more than a decade old only further diet data collection could test for sure whether such large scale changes have in fact occurred (though associated shifts in top predator biomasses have not been observed so shifts of sufficient magnitude are still unlikely). In contrast spawning biomasses of 130,000-\u2010170,000 t are plausible given existing data sets and ecological understanding of the system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3391396830203133413", "cites_id": ["3391396830203133413"], "pub_url": "https://www.afma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-02/Simulation%20analysis%20of%20jack%20mackerel%20stock%20sizes%202013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5b2k3HKpEC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
