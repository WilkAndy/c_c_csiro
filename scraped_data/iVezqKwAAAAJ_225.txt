For industries, such as fisheries, and societies to remain viable despite the change they will need to adapt to it, as they have adapted to many other changes through time. There are wide range of research projects into the mechanisms that assist or hinder adaptation.Simulation models, such as Atlantis, that consider the many interacting components of socio-ecological systems can appear complex, but they are an important tool for synthesising information, clarifying system understanding, laying out potential outcomes and highlight contradictory, uncertain or missing information. A number of simulation studies have already been based on south east Australia and a new set of simulations have been done using strategies and scenarios defined by stakeholders in the system. Some of the major findings from the modelling so far are that:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9506919134188530707", "cites_id": ["9506919134188530707"], "pub_url": "http://www.cakex.org/sites/default/files/documents/Atlantis-SEAP%20Report%20-%20Appendix%203%20-%20Results%20%26%20Barriers%20to%20adaptation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E-yrLZVc74MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
