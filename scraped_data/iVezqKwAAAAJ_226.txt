However, there has been a gradual shift over the past decade from a primary focus on target species and resources to a broader concern about impacts on other parts of the ecological systems in which fisheries operate. This broader focus has come to be known as ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM)(Pikitch et al. 2004) or the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF)(Garcia et al. 2003). Pikitch et al.(2004) state that the overall aim of EBFM is to sustain healthy marine ecosystems and the fisheries they support, with the more specific aims of (1) avoiding degradation of ecosystems,(2) minimizing the risk of irreversible change,(3) obtaining long term socioeconomic benefits from fishing, and (4) adopting a precautionary approach to uncertainty.This broader EBFM focus has arisen from concerns about a number of wider impacts of fishing. First among these has been bycatch, the taking and discarding of species other than target species (or other commercially valuable species). It has been estimated that fishing results in the annual discarding of around 27 million metric tons of bycatch (Alverson et al. 1996), and concerns have been raised about the impacts of this both on individual"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10726242419953781430", "cites_id": ["10726242419953781430"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rZACECFPe1AC&oi=fnd&pg=PA182&dq=info:tkoSoKZE25QJ:scholar.google.com&ots=WBWJC5QbR6&sig=yunK2zNpRYEDCyYMkAxW-6CEBHo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tkoSoKZE25QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
