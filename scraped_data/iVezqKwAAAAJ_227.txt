The Westernport Bay and catchment region is an ideal place for development of such tools: it is undergoing extensive urban development and significant change in catchment land practices; it provides important marine and coastal habitats for supporting biodiversity, conservation, recreation and commercial use; and it also provides catchment and storage of water for domestic and industrial use. In combination with those of the Mornington Peninsula, its unique attributes have also been recognised through the declaration of a UNESCO Biosphere for the region.In order to develop decision support tools for such a region, it is necessary to use a wellorganised framework. This involves establishing the key issues through stakeholder engagement, the collection of data and background information, and initial modelling, to ascertain knowledge gaps and to scope scientific capability for providing decision support."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6638597593999391269", "cites_id": ["6638597593999391269"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/savinam_x2005a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JboYxVYJIVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
