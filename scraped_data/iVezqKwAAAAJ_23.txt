However, the UN Sustainable Development Goals separate marine and terrestrial food production sectors and ecosystems. To sustainably meet increasing global demands for fish, the interlinkages among goals within and across fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture sectors must be recognized and addressed along with their changing nature. Here, we assess and highlight development challenges for fisheries-dependent countries based on analyses of interactions and trade-offs between goals focusing on food, biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate that some countries are likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks will be context-dependent, and will need to directly address the trade-offs among Sustainable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 194, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16667047529967582991", "cites_id": ["16667047529967582991"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0258-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D_9ENmw_TecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 18, "2019": 28, "2020": 39, "2021": 39, "2022": 53, "2023": 15}}
