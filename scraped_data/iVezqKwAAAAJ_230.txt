We aimed to evaluate the association between antimicrobial timing and mortality in patients presenting to the ED with septic shock.Post\u2010hoc analysis of 1587 adult participants enrolled in the Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) multicentre trial of early goal\u2010directed therapy for whom the time of initial antimicrobial therapy was recorded. We compared participants who had initiation of antimicrobials within the first hour (early) or later (delayed) of ED presentation. A propensity score model using inverse probability of treatment weighting was constructed to account for confounding baseline covariates. The primary outcome was 90\u2010day mortality.The median (interquartile range) time to initiating antimicrobials was 69 (39\u2013112) min with 712 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12275866442378140926", "cites_id": ["12275866442378140926"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1742-6723.13634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_lwWMH2jXKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
