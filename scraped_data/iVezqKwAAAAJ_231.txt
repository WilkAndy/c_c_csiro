It is important to allow for uncertainty when presenting model results, because it reduces the risk of errant or non-representative results. It is crucial that model results are presented as an envelope of what is likely, rather than presenting only one instance. We perturbed the initial conditions of the Chatham Rise Atlantis model and analysed the effect of this uncertainty on the model\u2019s dynamics by comparing the model outputs resulting from many initial condition perturbations. At the species group level, we found some species groups were more sensitive than others, with lower trophic level species groups generally more sensitive to perturbations of the initial conditions. We recommend testing for robust system dynamics by assessing the consistency of ecosystem indicators in response to fishing pressure under perturbed initial conditions. In any set of scenarios explored using complex end-to-end ecosystem models, we recommend that associated uncertainty analysis be included with perturbations of the initial conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10052050710385992040", "cites_id": ["10052050710385992040"], "pub_url": "https://peerj.com/articles/9254/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aCHF8NwOgIsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
