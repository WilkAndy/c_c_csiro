Dietary (isotope) and archaeological evidence indicates fish were a significant part of the diet of people in Africa and Eurasia in the Mid-Palaeolithic (Hu et al., 2009), with the earliest South African middens more than 150,000 years old. Tunas and other such pelagic fish have been exploited for at least forty-two thousand years (O\u2019Connor et al., 2011) and fish hooks carved from Trochus shell have been found from Timor to Okinawa, indicating the widespread use of such fishing gear by 23000 BP (Fujita et al., 2016). Written evidence of the importance of seafood to humanity dates to 4000 BC in Egypt (Chimits, 1957), with examples of texts on fishing methods and management found in all major ancient human cultures (Radcliffe, 1921; Costa-Pierce 2002). This love of seafood has not dwindled through time and today the total annual global fish production stands at more than 167 million tonnes of fish, with 146.3 million tonnes for human consumption and more than half of that from aquaculture (FAO, 2016). It is a major source of dietary protein, with more than 3 billion people dependent upon it. Fish has been the major source of animal protein for human consumption since 1960 and this per capita consumption is growing globally, trebling in the last fifty years (B\u00e9n\u00e9 et al., 2015). The affluent industrialised nations now consume at least 26.8 kg per capita annually; consumption is slightly lower in developing nations (at 20 kg per capita annually) and even the citizens of the poorest and food-deficit nations have doubled their consumption of seafood over the last thirty \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7098920742651390248", "cites_id": ["7098920742651390248"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=hqRyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA296&dq=info:KGljws1uhGIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_2biKcO50S&sig=FbNHZMfs_9Ig5nOSwK0R19na-lU", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KGljws1uhGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
