However, much of fishery science has been developed from a single-species perspective. Management schemes based on single-species reference points often ignore the trophic link among species and the technical interaction between gears, essentially disconnecting management objectives from the context of an ecosystem\u2014or socioecological system\u2014where fisheries operate. Using the Gulf of Thailand fishery as an example, we demonstrate how aggregate production models can be used to estimate system-level fishery reference points for multispecies fisheries. Our results show that the multispecies maximum sustainable yield changes with ecosystem state\u2014the systemic productivity level due to species composition and ecological (trophic/habitat, etc \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1505190750676925763", "cites_id": ["1505190750676925763"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/79/7/2138/6698554", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qz1NTQOD4xQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
