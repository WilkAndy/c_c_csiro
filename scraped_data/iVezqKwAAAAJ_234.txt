The current Research Topic explores futures for our oceans and coastal areas with a strong focus on effects of climate change, but also covering fishing, mass mortality events, and cumulative impacts from multiple stressors and human activities. It provides future visions for different timescales and regions, and what can be done to ameliorate negative impacts or outcomes. The geographic scope covers regions from the coast and enclosed seas to the open oceans, and from the Arctic to Southern Ocean. Together these 20 articles paint a stark picture of the changes expected in our oceans but also present assessment methods, management paths, policies, and actions necessary to alleviate and deal with future problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12868774045140419854", "cites_id": ["12868774045140419854"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.606538/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DoVc988Rl7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
