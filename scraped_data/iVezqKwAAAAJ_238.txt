These areas see the greatest ranges of human activities and are simultaneously the location of many ecological processes\u2013such as production, nutrient cycling and critical life history phases. This means that the areas with the greatest role in supporting the overall system can be those most directly under pressure. Robust management is required to prevent untoward impacts degrading the value and function of these systems. Such management can not simply deal with direct impacts, but must also give consideration to indirect effects and trade-offs between components of the systems and objectives of different user groups. Models of many forms are very helpful in teasing out these issues and allowing for an informed decision making process. We will present a brief outline of how the many different modelling efforts underway on Ningaloo fit together as an information jigsaw; and how that is being built on to form a whole of ecosystem model, which is being constructed using the InVitro modelling framework. To illustrate the potential of the approach, a hypothetical example will be posed-drawing on existing ecological components (eg whale sharks, reefs and their associated fauna) and prototype human components (eg tourists or contaminant plumes)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14807725972278005925", "cites_id": ["14807725972278005925"], "pub_url": "https://ningaloo-atlas.org.au/sites/default/files/Ningaloo%20Research%20Program%20progress%20report%202008.pdf#page=93", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pdD0LFGcf80J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
