In particular, questions have been raised by stakeholders about the possibility of a separate stock off the east coast of Tasmania. The information considered includes genetic analyses as well as the spatial distribution of spawning, schooling and eggs.Evidence from genetic studies is limited but suggests that sub-populations of jack mackerel Trachurus declivis may exist in the SPF. A \u2018sub-population\u2019as defined by Richardson (1982) is a self-sustaining genetic unit of population whereas a \u2018stock\u2019is the fish available to a fishery."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11164482934569085105", "cites_id": ["11164482934569085105"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9da1986611c2ab4a5ac96c4aa22faae514bae359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sajmtxM28JoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
