There may be still some resistance and that stigma goes back to very early times when EwE models were in formative stages both in terms of capturing ecosystem dynamics and validating the data and predictions. But the tide has turned and we are seeing fisheries and environment managers turning to ecosystem scientists and modellers for strategic advice. In Australia, in particular EwE and Atlantis (Fulton et al. 2004), have been used mostly to inform management strategies as in Fulton et al.(2007) rather than as a tool to synthesise large amounts of data. We discuss some examples where EwE models have been used in Australia and how their results are being reported in high-profile science publications and raising both the profile and the legitimacy of these models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12684313232926346517", "cites_id": ["12684313232926346517"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tommaso-Giarrizzo-2/publication/269279253_Assessing_the_impact_of_hydroelectric_dams_on_Amazonian_rivers_using_Ecopath_with_Ecosim_a_case_study_of_the_Belo_Monte_Dam/links/548631c70cf268d28f044d81/Assessing-the-impact-of-hydroelectric-dams-on-Amazonian-rivers-using-Ecopath-with-Ecosim-a-case-study-of-the-Belo-Monte-Dam.pdf#page=205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FY1cVK67B7AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
