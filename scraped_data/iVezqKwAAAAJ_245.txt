We use them as learning tools when reality itself is too difficult to handle [Boschetti et al., Chapter 8 in Volume 2; Perez, Chapter 10 in Volume 2]. To be useful, they must reproduce the aspects of the world we are interested in with sufficient accuracy to let us ignore many complicating factors without being led catastrophically astray. Scientific models are distinguished from other models in that they must conform to scientific understanding of real-world processes and the laws of nature (eg conservation of mass and energy), and as such are internally consistent. This constraint does not exist for the intuitively formed models used to guide day-to-day behaviour and participation in society, which derive from \u2018world views\u2019. World views are a form of intuitive (subconscious) model, described by Cocks [Volume 2, Chapter 13] as,\u2018\u2026 a coherent system of fundamental beliefs that describe some reality of interest\u2026 a thinking tool, a cognitive technology, which provides a first-stop mental model when seeking understanding (What\u2019s happening?) or when making decisions (What-to-do?)\u2019. Defined in this way, world views are synonymous with \u2018narratives\u2019, which Raupach [Volume 2, Chapter 14] describes as strongly, even viscerally, held beliefs about the way the world works or ought to work.People get their world views (or narratives) from many sources\u2014parents, peers (eg friends, sporting teams, ethnic groups), education, experience and religion. Peer group pressure is a major determinant of behaviour [1] and in the modern age self-reinforcement of personal views and prejudices through the internet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5489785770233370438", "cites_id": ["5489785770233370438"], "pub_url": "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/65944/2/01_Raupach_Living_scenarios_for_Australia_2012.pdf#page=161", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RhfBZxKjL0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2}}
