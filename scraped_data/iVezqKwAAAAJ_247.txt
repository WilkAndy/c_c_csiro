This has lead many governments to adopt policies of sustainable ecosystem-based resource management within their jurisdictions, which has motivated the development of a diverse range of scientific tools. One of the tools being utilised is the ecosystem model Atlantis (Fulton et al. 2004). This paper describes the application of Atlantis as a tool for exploring various impacts (including sewage treatment plants, industrial waste, multispecies commercial fisheries and recreational angling) on aquatic ecosystems in the Clarence estuary. We also use the model to evaluate management strategies for achieving conservation goals and sustainable use of natural resources (eg spatial zoning and fishing closures).While Atlantis has been applied to a significant number of continental shelf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2415356172560247834", "cites_id": ["2415356172560247834"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2415356172560247834&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GiyAT6QRhSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
