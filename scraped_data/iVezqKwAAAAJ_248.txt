Achieving this goal requires a complex intersection of science and management, and a recognition of the interconnections among people, place, and fish that govern these tightly coupled socioecological and sociotechnical systems. The World Fisheries Congress (WFC) convenes every four years and provides a unique global forum to debate and discuss threats, issues, and opportunities facing fish populations and fisheries. The 2021 WFC meeting, hosted remotely in Adelaide, Australia, marked the 30th year since the first meeting was held in Athens, Greece, and provided an opportunity to reflect on progress made in the past 30 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9560183951612178352", "cites_id": ["9560183951612178352"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-023-09765-8", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
