One of the little explored outcomes of human-induced change involves the decreasing body sizes of fishes. We use a marine ecosystem model to explore how a slow (less than 0.1% per year) decrease in the length of five harvested species could affect species interactions, biomasses and yields. We find that even small decreases in fish sizes are amplified by positive feedback loops in the ecosystem and can lead to major changes in natural mortality. For some species, a total of 4 per cent decrease in length-at-age over 50 years resulted in 50 per cent increase in predation mortality. However, the magnitude and direction in predation mortality changes differed among species and one shrinking species even experienced reduced predation pressure. Nevertheless, 50 years of gradual decrease in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9862911404805704333", "cites_id": ["9862911404805704333"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2012.1103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jcqXrqoZ4IgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 16, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 18, "2020": 24, "2021": 29, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
