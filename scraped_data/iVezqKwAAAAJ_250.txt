Achieving this goal for mixed fisheries requires better understanding of the effects of competing fishing fleets on shared resources and economic performance. Proposed management strategies that promote either specialisation or diversification of catches may result in unintended consequences for ecosystem\u2010based management. Here, we ask the following questions: does increased or decreased competition among fleets lead to better ecological and socio\u2010economic fishery outcomes? How effective are currently proposed management strategies for achieving these outcomes? We integrated fleet dynamics into a multispecies size\u2010spectrum model and parameterised this model to represent Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Mixed Fishery.
