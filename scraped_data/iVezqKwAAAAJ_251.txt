It is a three-dimensional model of Puget Sound that simulates every component of the marine ecosystem, from bacteria to killer whales. Atlantis produces forecasts of changes in the system under different scenarios. This report describes the model and all of its inputs, and provides details on the data that were used to build the model. It also provides the results of our initial calibration efforts, this essential first step being critical to making sure the forecasts produced by the model are reliable for fishery managers and decision-makers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2704210586837936516", "cites_id": ["2704210586837936516"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/40463", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hGlTgjNJhyUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
