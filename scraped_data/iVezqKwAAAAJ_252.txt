Increased dominance of algae and, in some cases, sponges has been documented on many coral reefs around the world, but how these organisms benefit from non-colonized substrate on the reef is unclear. In this study, we described the temporal dynamics of benthic organisms on an Indonesian coral reef across two time periods between 2006 and 2017 (2006\u20132008 and 2014\u20132017), and investigated the effects of colonizable substrate on benthic cover of coral reef organisms at subsequent sampling events. In contrast with other Indonesian reefs where corals have been declining, corals were dominant and stable over time at this location (mean \u00b1 SE percentage cover 42.7 \u00b1 1.9%). Percentage cover of turf algae and sponges showed larger interannual variability than corals and crustose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5060886490205155812", "cites_id": ["5060886490205155812"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/interannual-variability-and-decadal-stability-of-benthic-organisms-on-an-indonesian-coral-reef/9DF2B04C9822F28CB92F2DBFE765FC32", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5HFA-XLhO0YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
