The framework is built around the Baltic implementation of the spatially-explicit end-to-end Atlantis model, linked to the highresolution coupled physical-biological model HBM-ERGOM and the fisheries bio-economic Fishrent model. We investigate ecosystem responses to changes in human-induced pressures by simulating several eutrophication scenarios relevant to Baltic Sea management plans. We present the structure and calibration of the Baltic Atlantis and its operational linkages to the other models. Using the results of eutrophication scenarios, and focusing on the relative changes in fish and fishery production, we discuss the robustness of the model linking with respect to the underlying assumptions, strengths and weaknesses of the individual models. Finally, we describe possible framework expansion to account for spatial impacts and economic consequences, by linking to the individual-fishing-vessel based DISPLACE model. We conclude that the proposed model integration forms a robust framework for management strategy evaluation that is of strategic importance to stakeholders from around the Baltic Sea."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14357776207233596939", "cites_id": ["14357776207233596939"], "pub_url": "https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/ASCExtendedAbstracts/Shared%20Documents/M%20%20-%20Social,%20economic,%20and%20ecological%20impact%20assessment%20across%20marine%20sectors/M1215.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C762xGMRQccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
