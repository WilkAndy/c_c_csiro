As such it provides a practice-oriented reflection on collaboration between modelling projects grounded in a discussion of model outputs and extension activities.The Ningaloo Destination Modelling (NDM) project was one of five research projects within the Ningaloo Collaboration Cluster, a program of research that was funded by the CSIRO\u2019s Wealth from Oceans Flagship. The NDM project was also funded by the Sustainable Tourism CRC, and collaborated with a number of organisations including two Shires, state agencies, utility providers, tourism businesses and the Gascoyne Development Commission to gather data and refine model features and dynamics. The Ningaloo Collaboration Cluster focussed on the Ningaloo Coast, encompassing the Shires of Carnarvon and Exmouth, in the northwest of Western Australia. Beginning 900 km north of Perth, the Ningaloo Coast is a remote tourism destination with a resident population of approximately 8000. It attracts between 170 000 and 200 000 tourists a year. The growth of tourism and tourism development opportunities relies on the attraction of the region\u2019s remoteness and a delicate ecosystem linked to a fringing coral reef that is over 300 kilometres long. Thus inappropriate tourism development and visitor growth could jeopardise the future of tourism and alienate locals who place a high importance on the natural environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17506541590776103584", "cites_id": ["17506541590776103584"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/16812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oMLPu9K68_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
