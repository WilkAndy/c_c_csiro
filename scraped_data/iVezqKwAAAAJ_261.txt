Significant contributions are being made by a variety of university and government researchers. There are at least fifty stand alone research projects currently underway. Many of these have been organised under umbrella organisations such as the WA Marine Science Institute (WAMSI), CSIRO\u2019s Wealth from Oceans Flagship and its associated cluster (a joint CSIRO and multiple Universities Research Program). Research varies from bathymetry through studies of fish species to the social science of visitor behaviour. One of the significant activities is the development of models of various types that will serve as a major integrating output. While there is an \u201call encompassing\u201d model (InVitro) there are also activities to incorporate qualitative modelling and \u201cuser friendly\u201d modelling of components.The intent is that these efforts will result in informed decision makers and managers who will have tools that they will regularly use to reach intelligent decisions that enable them to manage the uncertainties associated with what is a complex socio-ecological system. To help ensure that adoption happens, CSIRO\u2019s Wealth from Oceans Flagship created a small \u201cclient outreach\u201d project, the purpose of which was to monitor the decision support needs of government and to help match these with the outcomes of the modelling. Initially this was considered to be a relatively simple process of maintaining and developing key links with decision makers and with the modellers and in a relatively straightforward way act as knowledge brokers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14649904603553516450", "cites_id": ["14649904603553516450"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/40486504/syme.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ossqUJ7qTssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
