The biological and technical interactions in mixed fisheries distinguish them from single-species fisheries, which makes them challenging for their assessment and management. The present knowledge synthesis reviewed pertinent policy documents and academic databases for twenty-three mixed fisheries worldwide; aiming to characterize attributes of mixed fisheries, provide overviews on their assessment and management, assess current research progress, and identify key factors that impact management effectiveness. Mixed fisheries were found to exhibit varying characteristics worldwide, rendering the implementation of universal management solutions unlikely. While mixed fisheries stock assessment and management are mostly based on single-species approaches, additional mixed fisheries considerations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23308249.2023.2213769", "cites_per_year": {}}
