Nevertheless, decadal-scale prediction is a rapidly developing field with an increasing number of applications to help guide ocean stewardship and sustainable use of marine environments. Such predictions can provide industry and managers with information more suited to support planning and management over strategic timeframes, as compared to seasonal forecasts or long-term (century-scale) predictions. The most significant advances in capability for decadal-scale prediction over recent years have been for ocean physics and biogeochemistry, with some notable advances in ecological prediction skill. In this paper, we argue that the process of \u201clighting the grey zone\u201d by providing improved predictions at decadal scales should also focus on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/80/1/16/6960601", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KoELxG8lCEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
