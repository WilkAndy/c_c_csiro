Feedback and change are basic features of ecosystems, something global change has highlighted. Changes in the physical environment will see shifts in species ranges, community compositions, and ultimately the form and function of ecosystem and the human societies that exploit them. What these shifts will be depends on which of the competing (and potentially counteracting) mechanisms dominate through space and time. Moreover, changes are unlikely to be simple or linear; there will be winners, losers, and surprises. It also means that management will be complex and non-stationary, presenting management, scientific, and statistical challenges.Fulton, E. A. 2011.
