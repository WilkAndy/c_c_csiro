Of particular concern are the recent rapid changes occurring in coral reef systems. With ongoing degradation from both local and global stressors, future reefs are likely to function differently from current coral-dominated ecosystems. Determining key attributes of future reef states is critical to reliably predict outcomes for ecosystem service provision. Here we explore the impacts of changing sponge dominance on coral reefs. Qualitative modelling of reef futures suggests that changing sponge dominance due to increased sponge abundance will have different outcomes for other trophic levels compared with increased sponge dominance as a result of declining coral abundance. By exploring uncertainty in the model outcomes we identify the need to (1) quantify changes in carbon flow through sponges, (2) determine the importance of food \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=270164409267778262&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
