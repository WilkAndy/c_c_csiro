End-to-end models that integrate physical, biogeochemical and behavioural processes are fundamental tools for supporting such assessments. We have developed an implementation of the Atlantis end-to-end ecosystem model for East Antarctica, specifically the southern Kerguelen Axis (Prydz Bay and southern Kerguelen Plateau, 50 E to 110 E, from the coast to 55 S). The Kerguelen Axis region is the most important location for primary production in East Antarctica, supports high value toothfish and icefish fisheries (on the northern Kerguelen Plateau), and is an important foraging area for marine mammals and birds.Atlantis (Fulton et al. 2004, 2011) is a modelling framework that was developed to support management strategy evaluation and includes dynamic, integrated representations of the biophysical system, human use and adaptive management. The Atlantis biophysical submodel is based on a system of irregular spatial polygons or \u2018boxes\u2019 in which ecological components are represented as either biomass pools or age-structured populations. The East Antarctic implementation of Atlantis currently comprises the biophysical submodel with 43 functional groups across the full spectrum of trophic levels (from bacteria to whales), 11 depth layers and 24 polygons (boxes). It also includes seasonal sea ice that provides habitat and nutrient cycling functions. For simplicity, the southern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/148336954.pdf#page=420", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jrFFDmfIFZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
