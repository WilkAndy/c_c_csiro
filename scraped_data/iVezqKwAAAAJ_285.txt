Both model types are very complex and thus it is not currently possible to let either model feed into the other. A reduction in complexity is needed to circumvent the challenge of combining complex models. The primary input into the mixed fisheries model in the North Sea (Fcube) is the catch and effort data aggregated by fleet and m\u00e9tier (Ulrich et al. 2012). It has been suggested that the partial F from the m\u00e9tiers could be used in the multi species model SMS, to constrain the F on the individual species. However, the m\u00e9tier system currently contains 18 m\u00e9tiers distributed across 10 countries and 20 fleet types, giving rise to 105 distinct fisheries entering the mix fish models. Thus, an aggregation of m\u00e9tiers is needed if the partial mortality rates from the mixed fisheries models are to be transferred to the multi species models.In the current study we applied principal component analysis to the catchability of each m\u00e9tier and fleets used in the mix fisheries models to investigate if fleets and m\u00e9tiers could be aggregated into a more manageable number of groups, while still contain the same information on catch composition and catchability of each species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00334/44526/44233.pdf#page=73", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NAnyTY1afnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
