The project was developed at the request of the Resource Assessment Group for the SPF (SPFRAG). The focus was to improve the harvest strategy for the fishery to make it fully compliant with the Commonwealth Harvest Strategy Policy (HSP).The study used a new variant of the Atlantis ecosystem model (Atlantis-SPF). Findings on the effects of fishing the four SPF target species on other parts of the food chain are clear. Both singly and in combination, depleting these target species has only minor impacts on other parts of the ecosystem. Unlike some other regions which show higher levels of dependence on similar species, such as in Peru and the Benguela systems (Smith et al., 2011), the food web in southern and eastern Australia does not appear to be highly dependent on SPF target species. None of the key higher trophic level predators in SE Australia, such as seals, penguins and tunas, has a high dietary dependence on these species. Studies using other ecosystem models such as Ecosim in the same region have reached similar conclusions (Goldsworthy et"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6ad8cfcc7b8a3edfd7ebf6367cfd3fc059af13c0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ELbXYsHtubQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
