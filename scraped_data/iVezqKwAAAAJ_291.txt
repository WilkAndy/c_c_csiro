We concluded that a set of 'living scenarios' could support a richer national conversation, but there are many challenges in developing such scenarios. A review of horizontal, vertical and archetype scenario approaches stressed engaging in dialogue and making assumptions explicit. Our workshop invited a small group of Australians to engage in short, intimate conversations through four scenario archetypes in order to explore a process and develop broad narratives for further exploration as living scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/36439", "cites_per_year": {}}
