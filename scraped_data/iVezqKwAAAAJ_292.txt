Furthermore, parameters that can change by orders of magnitude over various scales in time and space (diet, growth, life-history traits and behavioural responses), particularly under environmental or anthropogenic stress, require continued reassessment. Fundamental to most ecosystem models is a network budget analysis of energy, carbon or mass flow, which rely on thorough understanding of organic matter processing and predator-prey relationships. However, in ocean research, logistics multiply the cost constraints associated with undertaking traditional labour intensive methods such as stomach content analysis and recording biometrics.Biochemical tracer techniques now provide an established and cost effective means to evaluate multiple biological processes that operate over different scales and interact with different physical and chemical processes (Young et al. 2014). Measurements of bulk stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes, lipid and fatty acids, trace elements and amino acids now routinely provide food web, growth, life-history and physiological data integrated over time and space (eg, Post 2002, Parrish 2013, Bustamante et al. 1998). They are increasingly being used to define food web components (trophic positions and diet matrices), dominant basal food sources, and scalable measures for ascertaining ecosystem health.
