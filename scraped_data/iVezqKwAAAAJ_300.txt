It has been the focus of some of the greatest acts of collaborative science the world has seen to date (eg, the IPCC reports and model comparisons). There have been physical models (see the review in Randall et al., 2007), predictions of shifts in species distributions (Ling et al., 2009; Heikkinen et al., 2006) and models of economic impacts (eg, Hallegatte, 2009). The work on ecosystems has largely been through the use of the output of global climate models as drivers for multispecies or trophic models (Field et al., 2006). While these studies have all produced insights into potential effects of climate change one significant facet that has typically been lacking is feedback. Ecosystems involve links, direct and indirect pathways between their many ecological, physical, chemical and human (social and economic) components. Feedback and change are at the core of ecosystems. While this has always been true (and is one of the major drivers for using ecosystem models to explore fisheries issues), global climate change has made it clear that the non-stationary nature ecosystems, and their dynamics, needs to be addressed explicitly.The bulk of existing \u201cecological\u201d or \u201cecosystem\u201d climate models include plankton, typically phytoplankton, and any links to higher trophic levels (if they exist at all) are unidirectional. While these models are useful for understanding the potential distribution of future production and some of the implications for fish groups it is not enough if science is to provide insight into the dynamics of more complex species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andres-Cisneros-Montemayor/publication/285323131_Ecopath_25_Years_conference_Extended_Abstracts/links/5b59f3190f7e9bc79a668177/Ecopath-25-Years-conference-Extended-Abstracts.pdf#page=93", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tvbaq1H_MY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
