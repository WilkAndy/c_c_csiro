Ecosystem models are one tool used to consider these issues. The CSIRO Division of Marine Research has developed a number of ecosystem models using different underlying premises in an effort address a number of management issues. Two of the models are discussed here-Atlantis and In Vitro.Atlantis is a biogeochemical marine ecosystem model that tracks the nitrogen and silica flow through the main functional groups (benthic and pelagic, invertebrate and vertebrate, sedentary and highly mobile) and detritus types (labile detritus, refractory detritus and carrion) found in temperate ma-rine ecosystems. The primary producer and invertebrate consumer groups are represented by aggregate biomass pools, while the vertebrate groups are represented using age-structured models. The main processes considered in Atlantis are production, consumption, waste production, migra-tion, recruitment, habitat dependency, and mortality (both natural and due to human activities). The human activities accounted for include nutrient pollution, coastal habitat degradation due to devel-opment, and fisheries. Of these three submodels, the harvesting submodel is the most elaborated, allowing for multiple fleets-each with differing gear selectivity, habitat association, target, byproduct and bycatch groups, effort dynamics and management structures. All of these anthropogenic and biological components are implemented in a three dimensional spatially-resolved geography.
