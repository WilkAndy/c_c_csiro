Marine ecosystem management is increasingly expected to take into account a wide range of ecological and socio-economic factors. Decision making is helped by end-to-end ecosystem models that allow exploration of alternative management scenarios given a complex range of interacting factors.2. We present Atlantis\u2013a spatially structured largely deterministic end-to-end marine ecosystem model written in C, available for all major operating systems, based on dynamically interacting physics, biology, fisheries, management, assessment and economics submodels. A detailed installation guide and example application files are also provided. 3. One of the main features of Atlantis is its modularity. At the simplest level Atlantis can have uniform forcing of oceanographic processes, a single primary producer and a consumer. At the most complex level Atlantis can be used with a range of environmentally driven ecological responses, complex and habitat-dependent food web, dynamic assessment, management and fishing effort driven by market forces and human behaviour. The combination chosen should be guided by the available data and the questions to be answered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Asta-Audzijonyte-2/publication/334686973_Atlantis_A_spatially_explicit_end-to-end_marine_ecosystem_model_with_dynamically_integrated_physics_ecology_and_socio-economic_modules/links/5d42ecb1299bf1995b5d642d/Atlantis-A-spatially-explicit-end-to-end-marine-ecosystem-model-with-dynamically-integrated-physics-ecology-and-socio-economic-modules.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0R1je1fEteEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
