This requires simulation of both the ecosystem and the management process. The addition of an Atlantis model for the southern Benguela ecosystem would have several immediate benefits. These include increased understanding of the relative strengths of different ecosystem modelling techniques, the potential of Atlantis to model upwelling systems, and the usefulness of Atlantis in conjunction with stock assessment models for long-term fisheries management.The approach taken over the course of the project will consist of two key parts. Firstly, the model will be designed, configured and parameterised. Secondly, the model will be used to explore alternative management strategies with regard to biological outcomes. Particular issues to be explored include the degree of compatibility between the ecosystem-level MSE approach and a suite of single-species management plans, and the bioeconomic implications of ecosystem states."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.maram.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/302/workshop/IWS2011/MARAM%20IWS_DEC11_P_LTL_BG4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SanEg_g_HQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
