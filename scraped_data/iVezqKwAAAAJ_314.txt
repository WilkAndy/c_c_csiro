CCAMLR is globally acknowledged as successfully executing ecosystem-based management in the high seas surrounding Antarctica and for practicing rational use of the living marine resources. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources has addressed the problems of IUU fishing and of sea bird by-catch by adopting a range of conservation measures. The implementation of these measures have resulted in a significant decrease in IUU fishing and a close to zero seabird by-catch rate. In each of these examples CCAMLR\u2019s consensus-based decision-making process has been a central element in shaping outcomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/CM%20Doccuments/CM-2014/Theme%20Session%20G%20contributions/G5214.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zFZ1BR5NYQIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
