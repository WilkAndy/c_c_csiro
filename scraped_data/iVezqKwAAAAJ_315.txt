This is despite significant, recent advances in our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, of species\u2019 responses to environmental drivers, and of the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic marine and sea ice ecosystems (Constable et al. 2014, Figure 1). But the Southern Ocean is large and challenging to observe\u2013either directly or remotely. The really big unknowns for the ecosystems research community and for managers are: How do we reliably detect change on large scales? Are we likely to encounter big surprises in terms of future changes in Southern Ocean ecosystems? And how do we design robust management strategies for marine living resources in the face of climate change? We present a summary of the ecosystem modelling toolkit that has been developed at the ACE CRC, AAD and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nipr.ac.jp/symposium2014/program/abstract/OB_Melbournethomas_00175_01.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
