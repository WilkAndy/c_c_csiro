Percent of species in California Current Ecosim food web model (solid lines) and Atlantis ecosystem model (dashed lines) that exhibit changes in biomass of> 20%(either positive or negative) when forage groups are depleted below unfished levels. A value of 1.0 on the x-axis represents abundance of the forage group when it is not fished, while a value of 0.4 represents depletion of a focal forage group to 40% of unfished abundance. Focal forage groups are as follows: euphausiids--green triangles; forage fish--blue diamonds; mesopelagic fish--purple crosses; mackerel--black squares; sardines in Ecosim--orange circles. Vertical lines of the same colors represent abundance of each forage group that leads to maximum sustainable yield in the two models (only position on the x-axis is relevant, y-position is for graphical clarity only)......................................... 755"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://swfsc-publications.fisheries.noaa.gov/publications/CR/2013/2013Kaplan2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rMXA8-fAPqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
