ITQs are an economic instrument introduced in conjunction with a total allowable catch which is aimed at resolving the problems created by open access in wild fisheries. ITQs were proposed as a means to promote efficiency and there is growing empirical evidence that ITQs meet a number of economic and some social objectives. Even though improved stock status arises mainly from the total allowable catch levels implemented together with ITQs, such improvements have also been attributed to increased environmental stewardship resulting from the allocation of individual fishing rights.We define environmental stewardship as a set of normative values which private individuals may hold with respect to the marine ecosystem. Environmental stewardship entails perceived duties and obligations to carefully manage and use marine resources. In this paper we do not debate the success or otherwise of ITQs in meeting sustainability objectives, but discuss the premise that this success may in part be a consequence of a change in fishers\u2019 environmental stewardship. In particular, we question whether ownership of a use right per se creates particular attitudes and behaviours towards resource use that would not be observed from the same individuals if the rights were not owned by them."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.per.marine.csiro.au/staff/Fabio.Boschetti/papers/PropertyRights.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H7Z72V9vR6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
