During the historical years of the model runs actual recorded values were used. During the projected period alternative time series reflecting potential changes due to altered production levels were constructed. These alternative time series were put together by considering the increase in release during past production shifts (a non-linear function due to increasing efficiency and the introduction of new technologies) and applying corresponding increases in step with the'painted'production scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16974906831604436401&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
