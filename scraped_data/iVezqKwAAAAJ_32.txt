Engine power has often been estimated from subsets of the developed world, leading to inflated results. We disaggregated data into three sectors, artisanal (unpowered/powered) and industrial, and reconstructed the evolution of the fleet and its fishing effort. We found that the global fishing fleet doubled between 1950 and 2015\u2014from 1.7 to 3.7 million vessels. This has been driven by substantial expansion of the motorized fleet, particularly, of the powered-artisanal fleet. By 2015, 68% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. Although the global fleet is dominated by small powered vessels under 50 kW, they contribute only 27% of the global engine power, which has increased from 25 to 145 GW (combined powered-artisanal and industrial fleets). Alongside an expansion of the fleets, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7054728432494552913", "cites_id": ["7054728432494552913"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1820344116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UaevvSFu52EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 35, "2021": 48, "2022": 44, "2023": 9}}
