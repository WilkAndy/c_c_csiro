Winds drive ocean currents by transferring momentum to this layer. The important quantity in this process is the wind stress, which is a quadratic function of wind speed. The data used in this project were produced by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project. NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. The wind-stress dataset covers the period 1965 to 1997 and contains the following fields from which the velocity vector (speed and direction) were calculated:. zonal wind stress. meridional wind stress"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15006636407800138218&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
