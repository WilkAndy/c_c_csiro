Many hold that the most responsible strategy is ecosystem-based management (EBM), wherein factors such as ecological interactions, socio-economic forces and human impacts are explicit components of monitoring, assessment and policy. While EBM has been variously defined by many authors, some concepts are pervasive across all definitions: it is spatially discrete; it is adaptive; it incorporates dynamics, interactions and uncertainty associated with physical, chemical and biological constituents; it emphasizes sustainability; and it considers human objectives, activities and impacts to be essential components (Arkema et al., 2006). Because accounting for spatially explicit trends, processes and relationships is a main component of EBM, it follows that the spatial characteristics of marine ecosystems should be identified in order to provide a context for identifying stakeholders, defining objectives, conducting research, and implementing policies focused on sustainable management of species, goods and services (Juda, 1999; FAO, 2003, NOAA, 2004).The six member countries of PICES are all moving toward EBM of marine resources (section 2), and must therefore, identify and characterize discrete areas of marine waters at scales relevant to scientists, managers, policy makers and stakeholders. This challenge is complicated by several factors. First, abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems are inherently dynamic in space and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.pices.int/publications/scientific_reports/Report37/Chapter4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:99k9bOpNMLMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
