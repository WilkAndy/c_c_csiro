The Simplex method of minimising the sum of squares was used to fit the model to the benthos observations, with some parameters constrained to a biologically meaningful range. For the seagrass, macroalgae and mangrove habitats there was considerably less information available from which to estimate madel parameters. For these habitats the base-case parameters for the habitat equations were determined from expert information and heuristic fitting to available data on historical cover and distributions. The pessimistic and optimistic parameterisations were determined by considering the extremes of the relevant parameters in the literature and by exploring the dynamics of the system in the parameter space around the base case results. The pessimistic parameters were selected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8362995724892033632&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
