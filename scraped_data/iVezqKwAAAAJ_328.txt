These records contained information on the timing, route and intensity of the cyclone, though prior to the advent of GPS and automated monitoring, some of this information was approximate at best. The final footprint of the cyclone used by the Catastrophe agents in NWS-InVitro was constructed by mapping a polygon over each leg of a cyclone's route, with the track as the centreline and a width of 30km on either side of that central track. These footprints and an intensity index were stored in the Cyclone. data and Disaster. data files for use in NWS-InVitro."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4086692676327608023&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
