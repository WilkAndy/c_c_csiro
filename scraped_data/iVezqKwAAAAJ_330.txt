These models are calibrated for the major species groups and are detailed in Sections 3 and 15 in the companion model specification report (Gray et al. 2006). The selection of the parameters for each species was done by running the historical period of the model over a range of values of these parameters, and comparing the initial biomass of the simulation to a range of species biomass that was thought to occur in nature. Parameters were selected at three levels within this range of biomass to give the optimistic, base-case and pessimistic specifications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1119154395819337702&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
