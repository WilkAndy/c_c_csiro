One of the ways we can continue to unravel and understand marine ecosystem dynamics is via ecosystem modeling. We used one such model, ATLANTIS, to help explore the dynamics of the Northeast United States (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). We have parameterized ATLANTIS for the NEUS LME by including major functional groups across a range of biota, the physiographic dynamics of the ecosystem, and the major fishing fleets. The objectives of this work were to describe the application of this ATLANTIS NEUS model; briefly highlight modeling skill; note areas for further improvement, data gaps, major lessons learned, and how our understanding of the ecosystem was enhanced as we executed the modeling process; and note how these model outputs could inform living marine resource \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14529812024474379596", "cites_id": ["14529812024474379596"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661110001321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TKX-0w1DpMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 12, "2014": 12, "2015": 13, "2016": 15, "2017": 10, "2018": 10, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
