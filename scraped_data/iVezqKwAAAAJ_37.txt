Here we use the Framework on Ocean Observing (FOO) to begin developing ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) for the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). An eEOV is a defined biological or ecological quantity, which is derived from field observations, and which contributes significantly to assessments of Southern Ocean ecosystems. Here, assessments are concerned with estimating status and trends in ecosystem properties, attribution of trends to causes, and predicting future trajectories. eEOVs should be feasible to collect at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and are useful to the extent that they contribute to direct estimation of trends and/or attribution, and/or development of ecological (statistical or simulation) models to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5528863114270857564", "cites_id": ["5528863114270857564"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796316300756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XNnfkbV3ukwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 15, "2018": 23, "2019": 24, "2020": 26, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
