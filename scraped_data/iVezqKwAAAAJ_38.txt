Here, we describe the effects of ocean acidification on an upwelling system that already experiences inherently low pH conditions, the California Current. We used an end\u2010to\u2010end ecosystem model (Atlantis), forced by downscaled global climate models and informed by a meta\u2010analysis of the pH sensitivities of local taxa, to investigate the direct and indirect effects of future pH on biomass and fisheries revenues. Our model projects a 0.2\u2010unit drop in pH during the summer upwelling season from 2013 to 2063, which results in wide\u2010ranging magnitudes of effects across guilds and functional groups. The most dramatic direct effects of future pH may be expected on epibenthic invertebrates (crabs, shrimps, benthic grazers, benthic detritivores, bivalves), and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1708229726664980022", "cites_id": ["1708229726664980022"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13594", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NvagxOLZtBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 20, "2019": 13, "2020": 25, "2021": 22, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
