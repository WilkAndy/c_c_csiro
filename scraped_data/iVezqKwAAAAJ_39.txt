We focus on expertise relevant to any complex problem, especially contributory expertise, divided into \u2018knowing-that\u2019and \u2018knowing-how.\u2019We also deal with interactional expertise and the fact that much expertise is tacit. We explore three questions. First, in examining \u2018when is expertise in research integration and implementation required?,\u2019we review tasks essential (a) to developing more comprehensive understandings of complex problems, plus possible ways to address them, and (b) for supporting implementation of those understandings into government policy, community practice, business and social innovation, or other initiatives. Second, in considering \u2018where can expertise in research integration and implementation currently be found?,\u2019we describe \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10252892454279391858", "cites_id": ["10252892454279391858"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0380-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ciqbcV2XSY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 17, "2021": 34, "2022": 47, "2023": 17}}
