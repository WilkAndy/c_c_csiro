We explored the interaction effects of fishing, ocean warming, and ocean acidification over time on 60 functional groups of species in the southeastern Australian marine ecosystem. We tracked changes in relative biomass within a coupled dynamic whole\u2010ecosystem modeling framework that included the biophysical system, human effects, socioeconomics, and management evaluation. We estimated the individual, additive, and interactive effects on the ecosystem and for five community groups (top predators, fishes, benthic invertebrates, plankton, and primary producers). We calculated the size and direction of interaction effects with an additive null model and interpreted results as synergistic (amplified stress \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13708399805084004091", "cites_id": ["13708399805084004091"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01937.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:--4QFf4EPr4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 16, "2016": 15, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
