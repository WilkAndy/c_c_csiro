The same cannot be said for ecosystem models. As ecosystem models become more popular more needs to be known about the effects of model formulation on model behaviour and performance. The impact of the form of the grazing response function and mortality terms used in a biogeochemical ecosystem model are considered here. We show that in the large and inter-linked webs used in ecosystem models, model behaviour is far more sensitive to the form of the grazing term than to that of the mortality terms that close the modelled food web. When using biogeochemical ecosystem models in shallow marine ecosystems, the most dynamic and sophisticated functional responses describing grazing require more parameters and validation than the simpler Holling disk equation, but usually still lead to the same \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9479570192614035298", "cites_id": ["9479570192614035298"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380003002680", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yg8kgt0yjoMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 10, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
