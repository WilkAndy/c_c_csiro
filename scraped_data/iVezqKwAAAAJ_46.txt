They can provide system understanding, learning, a platform for stakeholder engagement, projections of system behaviour and an environment for virtual testing of alternative management strategies. However, rarely is a single numerical model suitable for all these purposes. Our experience is that a suite of models of different size, complexity and scope can be more effective and can better address the needs of environmental management projects. Models of different complexity can address different needs, but can also be combined as a flexibly sculpted tool kit \u2013 as they require very different development effort they can be deployed at different stages during a project. Using rapidly deployed qualitative, or simple quantitative, models stakeholders can be exposed to models very early in the project, eliciting feedback \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1105786704727888488", "cites_id": ["1105786704727888488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901114002342", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aNKnNCaLWA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 10, "2018": 18, "2019": 12, "2020": 19, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
