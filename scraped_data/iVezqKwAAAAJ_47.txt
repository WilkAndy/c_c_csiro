However, spatially simplified models may be incapable of reproducing important dynamics observed in nature. To consider this issue the effect of spatial structure on the output of two trophic ecosystem models (Bay Model 2 (BM2) and the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model (IGBEM)) was considered using a theoretical approach known as \u2018deep\u2013shallow model\u2019 comparison. This involved comparing simulation runs of 1-, 3-, and 8-box versions of the ecosystem models (the \u2018shallow\u2019 models) with a 59-box version that was used to represent the real world (the \u2018deep\u2019 model). The results indicate that simpler spatial configurations (geometries) can result in less short-term variation, changes in predicted spatial patterns and trophic self \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17850366209943628955", "cites_id": ["17850366209943628955"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380003005416", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m2xTHn49ufcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
