We used a range of ecosystem models to explore the effects of fishing low\u2013trophic level species on marine ecosystems, including marine mammals and seabirds, and on other commercially important species. In five well-studied ecosystems, we found that fishing these species at conventional maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels can have large impacts on other parts of the ecosystem, particularly when they constitute a high proportion of the biomass in the ecosystem or are highly connected in the food web. Halving exploitation rates would result in much lower impacts on marine ecosystems while still achieving 80% of MSY."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 646, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17197665525676202502", "cites_id": ["17197665525676202502"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1209395", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Blrpr61hqu4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 35, "2013": 51, "2014": 82, "2015": 72, "2016": 57, "2017": 64, "2018": 51, "2019": 67, "2020": 59, "2021": 46, "2022": 34, "2023": 15}}
