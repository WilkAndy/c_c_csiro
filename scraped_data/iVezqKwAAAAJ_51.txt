At the same time, increasing fisheries exploitation is impacting on marine ecosystems. Here, using increased benthic\u2010invertebrate mortality as a proxy for effects of ocean acidification, the potential impact of the two stressors of fishing and acidification on the southeast Australian marine ecosystem to year 2050 was explored. The individual and interaction effects of the two stressors on biomass and diversity were examined for the entire ecosystem and for regional assemblages. For 61 functional groups or species, the cumulative effects of moderate ocean acidification and fishing were additive (30%), synergistic (33%), and antagonistic (37%). Strong ocean acidification resulted in additive (22%), synergistic (40%), and antagonistic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9213447719854768744", "cites_id": ["9213447719854768744"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02453.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aIKT4uK93H8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 14, "2014": 8, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
