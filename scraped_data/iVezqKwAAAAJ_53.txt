However, institutional structures and practices to support interdisciplinary research are still developing and a shared understanding on how best to develop effective interdisciplinary researchers (particularly at early career stages) is lacking. Barriers to interdisciplinary approaches, which include diverse disciplinary \u2018languages\u2019, research time constraints and limited guidance on how to achieve interdisciplinarity in practice, further challenge this understanding. To help overcome these barriers, this paper provides practical advice for early career researchers and their mentors, as well as senior researchers and lab leaders, in the form of 10 tips: \u2018Develop an area of expertise\u2019; \u2018Learn new languages\u2019; \u2018Be open-minded\u2019; \u2018Be patient\u2019; \u2018Embrace complexity\u2019; \u2018Collaborate widely; \u2018Push \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3179214210651009105", "cites_id": ["3179214210651009105"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42532-019-00018-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UTC6-nrWHiwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 19, "2021": 25, "2022": 26, "2023": 10}}
