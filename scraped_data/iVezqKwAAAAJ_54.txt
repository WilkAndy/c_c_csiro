Repeated failures of single-species management have led us to a new paradigm \u2014 managing at the ecosystem level. Ecosystem management involves a complex array of interacting organisms, processes and scientific disciplines. Accounting for interactions, feedback loops and dependencies between ecosystem components is therefore fundamental to understanding and managing ecosystems. We provide an overview of the main types of ecosystem models and their uses, and discuss challenges related to modelling complex ecological systems. Existing modelling approaches typically attempt to do one or more of the following: describe and disentangle ecosystem components and interactions; make predictions about future ecosystem states; and inform decision making by comparing alternative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5009739385884487866", "cites_id": ["5009739385884487866"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01298-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:urDtwG0rhkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 19, "2022": 38, "2023": 21}}
