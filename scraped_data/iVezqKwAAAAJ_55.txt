Ranking the ecological relative status of exploited marine ecosystems. \u2013 ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 769\u2013786.           A set of simple, data-based ecological indicators was used to rank exploited ecosystems regarding fishing impacts with respect to their status, trends, and ecosystem EAF attributes. Expected theoretical changes in indicators with respect to increasing fishing impacts were considered, and ecosystems were compared by examining the mean values of indicators in the most recent three years for which data were available and over time (1980\u20132005 and 1996\u20132005). Systems were classified into nine potential categories according to whether they were most, moderately, or least impacted, and whether they were becoming more or \u2026Coll, M., Shannon, L.
