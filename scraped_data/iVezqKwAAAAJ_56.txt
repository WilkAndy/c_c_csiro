These data have traditionally derived from stomach content analysis, but new and complementary forms of ecological data are increasingly available from biochemical tracer techniques. Extensive opportunities exist to improve the empirical robustness of ecosystem models through the incorporation of biochemical tracer data and derived indices, an area that is rapidly expanding because of advances in analytical developments and sophisticated statistical techniques. Here, we explore the trophic information required by ecosystem model frameworks (species, individual, and size based) and match them to the most commonly used biochemical tracers (bulk tissue and compound-specific stable isotopes, fatty acids, and trace elements \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9282683680779192618", "cites_id": ["9282683680779192618"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-marine-121916-063256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KskoO6C30oAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 24, "2020": 13, "2021": 11, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
