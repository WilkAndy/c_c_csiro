Applying a suite of data\u2010limited methods to global catch data, combined through an ensemble modeling approach, we provide quantitative estimates of exploitation status for 785 fish stocks. Fifty\u2010three percent (414 stocks) are below BMSY and of these, 265 are estimated to be below 80% of the BMSY level. While the 149 stocks above 80% of BMSY are conventionally considered \u201cfully exploited,\u201d stocks staying at this level for many years, forego substantial yield. Our results enable managers to consider more detailed information than simply a categorization of stocks as \u201cfully\u201d or \u201cover\u201d exploited. Our approach is reproducible, allows consistent application to a broad range of stocks, and can be easily updated as new data become available.
