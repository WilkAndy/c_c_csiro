Exciting new developments include temporal-spatial and end-to-end modelling, as well as novel applications to environmental impact analyses, in both aquatic and terrestrial domains. A wide range of plug-ins have been added to extend the diagnostic capabilities of EwE, and the scientific community is applying EwE to a diversified range of topics besides fishing impact assessments, such as the development of scientific advice for management, the analysis of conservation issues, and the evaluation of cumulative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5731284386681386423", "cites_id": ["5731284386681386423"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-015-9386-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t_XitsiciU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 12, "2017": 15, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
