There is a pressing need for robust predictions of potential futures of coral reef and associated human systems under alternative management scenarios. Understanding and predicting the dynamics of coral reef systems at regional scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers is imperative, because reef systems are connected by physical and socioeconomic processes across regions and often across international boundaries. We present a spatially explicit regional\u2010scale model of ecological dynamics for a general coral reef system. In designing our model as a tool for decision support, we gave precedence to portability and accessibility; the model can be parameterized for dissimilar coral reef systems in different parts of the world, and the model components and outputs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3705445760621968268", "cites_id": ["3705445760621968268"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/09-1564.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jHtZeEljbDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
