To date, the IndiSeas programme (Indicators for the Seas) has focussed on assessing the ecological impacts of fishing at the ecosystem scale using ecological indicators. Here, we explore fisheries \u2018Management Effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018Governance Quality\u2019 and relate this to ecosystem health and status. We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem\u2010based perspective, using objective and evidence\u2010based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods.
