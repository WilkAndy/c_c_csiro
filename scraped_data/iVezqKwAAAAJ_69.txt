Decreases or increases in fish population growth rate driven by environmental change, including ecosystem and climate change, affect the harvest that can be taken sustainably. If not acted on rapidly, environmental change could result in unsustainable fishing or missed opportunity for higher catches. Using simulation models of harvested fish populations influenced by environmental change, we explore how long fisheries managers can afford to wait before changing harvest regulations in response to changes in population growth. If environmental change causes population declines, delays greater than five years increase the probability of population collapse. Species with fast and highly variable population growth rates are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3521815307016722879", "cites_id": ["3521815307016722879"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/11-0419.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v9lDw1wA4DAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
