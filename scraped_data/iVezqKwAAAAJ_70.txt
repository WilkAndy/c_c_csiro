Two biogeochemical marine ecosystem models were constructed as the foundation of a study considering many aspects of model simplification. The models use a trophic web that is resolved to the level of functional groups (feeding guilds), and includes the main pelagic and benthic guilds from primary producers to high-level predators. Both models are process based, but the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model (IGBEM) is highly physiologically detailed, while Bay Model 2 (BM2) uses simpler general assimilation equations. Both models compare well with real systems under a wide range of eutrophication and fishing schemes. They also conform to general ecological checkpoints and produce spatial zonation and temporal cycles characteristic of natural systems. The performance of IGBEM is not consistently better than that of BM2, indicating that high levels of physiological detail are not always required when modelling system dynamics. This was reinforced by a section of the study that fitted BM2, IGBEM and an existing ecosystem model (ECOSIM) to Port Phillip Bay. The predictions of all three models lead to the same general conclusions across a range of fishing management strategies and scenarios for environmental change. Models that are less resolved or use simpler formulations have lower computational demands and can be easier to parameterise and interpret. However, simplification may produce models incapable of reproducing important system dynamics.
