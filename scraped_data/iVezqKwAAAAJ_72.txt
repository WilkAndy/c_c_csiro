In the marine environment, indicators have been developed to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing to support an ecosystem approach to fisheries. However, very little work on the performance and robustness of ecological indicators has been carried out. An important aspect of robustness is that indicators should respond specifically to changes in the pressures they are designed to detect (e.g. fishing) rather than changes in other drivers (e.g. environment). We adopted a multi-model approach to compare and test the specificity of commonly used ecological indicators to capture fishing effects in the presence of environmental change and under different fishing strategies. We tested specificity in the presence of two types of environmental change: \u201crandom\u201d, representing interannual climate variability and \u201cdirectional\u201d, representing climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15650708533804202116", "cites_id": ["15650708533804202116"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18300104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hPiSkH18MtkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 26, "2020": 14, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
