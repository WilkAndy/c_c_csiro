In this study, we used a multi-model ecosystem simulation approach to explore the combined effects of fishing and primary productivity on different components of the food-web across a suite of ecosystems and a range of model types. Simulations were carried out under different levels of primary productivity and various fishing scenarios. In addition to exploring synergistic, additive or antagonistic combined effects of multiple stressors, we included a fourth category \u201cdampened\u201d, which refers to less negative or less positive impacts compared to additive ones, and in contrast to previous studies, we explicitly considered the direction (positive or negative) of the combined effects. We focused on two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17377614138957463307", "cites_id": ["17377614138957463307"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380017302661", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C39dJP2vKfEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
