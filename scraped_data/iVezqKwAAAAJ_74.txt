Invertebrates play important and diverse functional roles in marine ecosystems, yet the ecosystem effects of their exploitation are poorly understood. Using 12 ecosystem models distributed worldwide, we analysed the trade\u2010offs of various invertebrate fisheries and their ecosystem effects as well as ecological indicators. Although less recognized for their contributions to marine food webs, our results show that the magnitude of trophic impacts of invertebrates on other species of commercial and conservation interest is comparable with those of forage fish. Generally, cephalopods showed the strongest ecosystem effects and were characterized by a strong top\u2010down \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7094295203567245287", "cites_id": ["7094295203567245287"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5xdihOb_c2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 18, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
