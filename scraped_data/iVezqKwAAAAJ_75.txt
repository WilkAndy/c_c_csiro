They also must build management plans that respond to the dynamic oceanography and productivity of the region. New management tools, such as spatial closures or climate-triggered fishing policies, could help address some of these issues, but a modeling framework is needed against which to test such potential policies. To address this need, an ecosystem model was constructed of the Northern California Current Ecosystem, which extends from the US-Canada border to Point Conception, California, and out to the 1,200 m isobath.Presented here are the coupled biological-oceanographic model and documented assumptions, parameterization, and data sources. Later versions will include the fisheries and will be used to evaluate management strategies. The model structure, Atlantis, includes the trophic dynamics of 54 functional groups in the food web, using nitrogen as a common currency between groups. Functional groups include habitat-forming species such as kelp, corals and sponges, as well as phytoplankton, detritus, and consumers such as fish and zooplankton."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1938376305510995425", "cites_id": ["1938376305510995425"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/3525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4VUE2_p-5hoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
