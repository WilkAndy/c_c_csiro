However, current growth in population and increased accessibility of coastal resources through technology have resulted in overcrowded and often conflicted spaces. The recent global move towards development of national blue economy strategies further highlights the increased focus on coastal resources to address a broad range of blue growth industries. The need to manage sustainable development and future exploitation of both over-utilised and emergent coastal resources is both a political and environmental complexity. To address this complexity, we draw on the perspectives of a multi-disciplinary team, utilising two in depth exemplary case studies in New Zealand and within the Myanmar Delta Landscape, to showcase barriers, pathways and actions that facilitate a move from Business as Usual (BAU) to a future aligned with the Sustainable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9654999947923407802", "cites_id": ["9654999947923407802"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-021-09636-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:usNjWkxz_YUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 10, "2022": 29, "2023": 21}}
