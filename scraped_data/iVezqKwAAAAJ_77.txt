In the present paper multiple-use MSE is focused on four sectors: oil and gas, conservation, fisheries, and urban and industrial development. A selection of cross-sectoral development scenarios, management strategies and computer representations, provided by the relevant interest groups, is represented. These include prospective future sectoral activities and their impacts, and the sectoral response to alternative management policies and strategies. The agent-based modelling software InVitro is well placed for analysing prospective social and ecological impacts of multiple-use management strategies in a risk-assessment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8404096581260243964", "cites_id": ["8404096581260243964"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475408000517", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_HMXWFBZoXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
