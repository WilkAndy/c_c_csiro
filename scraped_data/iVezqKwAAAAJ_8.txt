Here, simulation models of two marine systems off southeastern Australia (a large marine embayment, and an EEZ-scale regional marine ecosystem) are used to evaluate the performance of a suite of ecological indicators. The indicators cover species, assemblages, habitats, and ecosystems, including quantities derived from models such as Ecopath. The simulation models, based on the Atlantis framework, incorporate the effects of fishing from several fishing gears, and also the confounding impacts of other broad-scale pressures on the ecosystems (e.g. increased nutrient loads). These models are used to provide fishery-dependent and fishery-independent pseudo-data from which the indicators are calculated. Indicator performance is quantified by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 526, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4577205547933107507", "cites_id": ["4577205547933107507"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/62/3/540/665354", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MwWA3DGAhT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 14, "2007": 23, "2008": 14, "2009": 31, "2010": 45, "2011": 37, "2012": 32, "2013": 32, "2014": 44, "2015": 29, "2016": 37, "2017": 27, "2018": 37, "2019": 45, "2020": 27, "2021": 24, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
