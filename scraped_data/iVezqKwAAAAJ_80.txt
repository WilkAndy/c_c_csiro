However, progress towards implementing and operationalizing it has been slow. We take a pragmatic approach to EBM. Our simple definition is balancing human activities and environmental stewardship in a multiple-use context. In this paper, we present case studies on the development and implementation of EBM in Australia. The case studies (Australia\u2019s Ocean Policy, the Great Barrier Reef, New South Wales (NSW) marine estate, Gladstone Harbour, and South Australia and Spencer Gulf) span different spatial scales, from national to regional to local. They also cover different levels of governance or legislated mandate. We identify the key learnings, necessary components and future needs to support better implementation. These include requirements for clearly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7662354700864412989", "cites_id": ["7662354700864412989"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/7/1990/3958176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PV0R6AAnVmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
