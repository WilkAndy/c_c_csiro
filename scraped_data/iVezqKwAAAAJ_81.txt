Decision\u2010making is helped by end\u2010to\u2010end ecosystem models that allow exploration of alternative management scenarios given a complex range of interacting factors. We present Atlantis \u2013 a spatially structured largely deterministic end\u2010to\u2010end marine ecosystem model written in C, available for all major operating systems, based on dynamically interacting physics, biology, fisheries, management, assessment and economics submodels. A detailed installation guide and example application files are also provided. One of the main features of Atlantis is its modularity. At the simplest level Atlantis can have uniform forcing of oceanographic processes, a single primary producer and a consumer. At the most complex level, Atlantis can be used with a range of environmentally driven \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6454383560674802040", "cites_id": ["6454383560674802040"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eHkk0qaTklkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 15, "2023": 9}}
