Solutions proposed to increase the sustainability of agriculture, aquaculture, and capture fisheries have typically approached development from single sector perspectives. Recent work highlights the importance of recognising links among food sectors, and the challenge cross\u2010sector dependencies create for sustainable food production. Yet without understanding the full suite of interactions between food systems on land and sea, development in one sector may result in unanticipated trade\u2010offs in another. We review the interactions between terrestrial and aquatic food systems. We show that most of the studied land\u2013sea interactions fall into at least one of four \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6340292081819268528", "cites_id": ["6340292081819268528"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13873", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sDUPXQ4-_VcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
