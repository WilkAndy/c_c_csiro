The ultimate effectiveness of spawning area closures is unknown, as spawning-related determinants of catch rate have not been studied. A simulation model, based on existing biological and fisher information, was constructed to examine the most important determinants of the spawning season catch rates using the protogynous aggregative spawner Plectropomus leopardus (Family Serranidae, Subfamily Epinephelinae) as a test case. Model output indicated that spawning season catches rose as long as catchability of spawners was equal to or greater than that of nonspawners. Greatest increases in catch were produced by fish moving from habitats inaccessible to fishers into regularly fished locations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6897348457032123653", "cites_id": ["6897348457032123653"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f99-046", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BQV9weBNuF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
