The EAF was expected to meet some aspirations for biodiversity conservation, but health was principally linked to sustainable use rather than lower levels of human impact. Consequently, while policies including EAF concepts identified objectives for fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, the wording often reflected unresolved societal and political debates about objectives and gave imprecise guidance on addressing inevitable trade\u2010offs. Despite scientific progress in making trade\u2010offs and consequences explicit, there remain substantial differences in interpretations of acceptable impact, responses to uncertainty and risk, and the use of management measures by groups accountable for fisheries management and biodiversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14971991912913211751", "cites_id": ["14971991912913211751"], "pub_url": "https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.12489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z5E23VEzx88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
