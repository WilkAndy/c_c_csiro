Indicators to measure performance against objectives have been suggested, tested, and refined but with a strong bias towards ecological indicators. In this paper, current use and application of indicators related to the human dimension in EBFM research and ecosystem models are analysed. It is found that compared to ecological counterparts, few indicators related to the human dimension are commonly associated with EBFM, and they mainly report on economic objectives related to fisheries. Similarly, in the most common ecosystem models, economic indicators are the most frequently used related to the human dimension, both in terms of model outputs and inputs. The prospect is small that indicators mainly related to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13329674313488904263", "cites_id": ["13329674313488904263"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18309126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R7AnGyqE_LgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 9, "2021": 20, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
