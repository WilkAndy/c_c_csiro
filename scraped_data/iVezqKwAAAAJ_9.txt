Strategies to reduce these impacts while addressing the growing need for food security  include increasing selectivity (, ): capturing species, sexes, and sizes in proportions that differ from their occurrence in the ecosystem. Increasing evidence suggests that more selective fishing neither maximizes production nor minimizes impacts (\u2013). Balanced harvesting would more effectively mitigate adverse ecological effects of fishing while supporting sustainable fisheries. This strategy, which challenges present management paradigms, distributes a moderate mortality from fishing across the widest possible range of species, stocks, and sizes in an ecosystem, in proportion to their natural productivity , so that the relative size and species composition is maintained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 521, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2574736867358776009", "cites_id": ["2574736867358776009"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1214594", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yZoFEYpNuyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 19, "2013": 34, "2014": 61, "2015": 60, "2016": 66, "2017": 59, "2018": 51, "2019": 55, "2020": 41, "2021": 29, "2022": 28, "2023": 13}}
