Cephalopod ecology, however, is still poorly understood as observational studies often give highly uncertain and variable results due to the peculiarities of cephalopod behaviour and biology, and their responsiveness to external drivers. This review evaluates our representation of cephalopods in ecosystem models and the insights given by these models on the role of cephalopods in our oceans. We examined ecosystem models from 13 regions to analyse the representation of cephalopods and compared their results to local trophic studies. Our analysis indicated that most ecosystem models inadequately include cephalopods in terms of model structure and parametrization; although some models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14083524699257621173", "cites_id": ["14083524699257621173"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-019-09554-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tcqwpBi7csMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 11, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
