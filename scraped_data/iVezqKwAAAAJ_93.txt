Reducing consumption of animal-source foods is frequently presented as key to improving the sustainability of food systems. 2 Fish and seafood can have a lower environmental impact and in many cases are considered more efficient than terrestrial animal production (albeit with wide variation) depending on the type of production or capture method, 3 yet remain largely absent, or insufficiently articulated in the sustainable diets literature, rendering their future role in healthy diets unclear. 4 This absence of specific consideration of fish and seafood extends to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1859288271884571720", "cites_id": ["1859288271884571720"], "pub_url": "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(19)30018-X/fulltext", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SNS6FNWEzRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 17, "2023": 6}}
