ITQs are an example of incentive-based fisheries management in which fishing rights can be privately owned and traded. ITQs are aimed at resolving the problems created by open-access fisheries. ITQs were proposed to promote economic efficiency, and there is growing empirical evidence that ITQs meet a number of economic and social fisheries management objectives. Even though improved stock status arises as a consequence of the total allowable catch levels implemented together with ITQs, the effect is difficult to separate from the improvement attributable to existing and new management changes. However, stock status improvements have also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14803785602949314012", "cites_id": ["14803785602949314012"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26269588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3PXVcpKccc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
