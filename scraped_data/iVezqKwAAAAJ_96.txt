The majority of the biomass estimates came directly from a large-scale visual survey program; therefore, data were collected in the same way for all three models, enhancing comparability. Model outputs\u2013such as net system production, size structure of the community, total throughput, production, consumption, production-to-respiration ratio, and Finn\u2019s cycling index and mean path length\u2013indicate that the systems around the unpopulated French Frigate Shoals and along the relatively lightly populated Kona Coast of Hawai\u2019i Island are mature, stable systems with a high efficiency in recycling of biomass. In contrast, model results show that the reef system around the most populated island in the State of Hawai\u2019i, O\u2019ahu, is in a transitional state with reduced ecosystem resilience and appears to be shifting to an algal-dominated system. Evaluation of the candidate indicators for fishing pressure showed that indicators at the community level (e.g., total biomass, community size structure, trophic level of the community) were most robust (i.e., showed the clearest trend) and that multiple indicators are necessary to identify fishing perturbations. These indicators could be used as performance indicators when compared to a baseline for management purposes. This study shows that ecosystem models can be valuable tools in identification of the system state in terms of complexity, stability, and resilience and, therefore, can complement biological metrics currently used by monitoring programs as indicators for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8744252917668320584", "cites_id": ["8744252917668320584"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063797", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SBXLF7PTWXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
