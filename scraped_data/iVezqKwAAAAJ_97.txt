However, testing of fundamental assumptions such as system structure or process formulations is rarely done. In this study, we compare the output of three different ecosystem models (Atlantis, Ecopath with Ecosim, and OSMOSE) applied to the same ecosystem (the southern Benguela), to explore which ecosystem effects of fishing are most sensitive to model uncertainty. We subjected the models to two contrasting fishing pressure scenarios, applying high fishing pressure to either small pelagic fish or to adult hake. We compared the resulting model behaviour at a system level, and also at the level of model groups. We analysed the outputs in terms of various commonly used ecosystem indicators, and found some similarities in the overall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14595784763892375395", "cites_id": ["14595784763892375395"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2989/1814232X.2015.1013501", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yx_dNemkjsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
