Mounting conservation concerns have prompted researchers to propose new management regulations, restricting fishing and protecting sensitive species. Compliance with existing regulations is poor. Rules that are currently in place, if followed, may go a long way towards achieving the ecological goals of management.2.\u2002We conduct a review of existing fisheries regulations in this area. Then, using a spatially explicit marine ecosystem model (Atlantis), we estimate the benefits of compliance with existing fisheries regulations.3.\u2002Under a full compliance scenario, we find large increases in protected species biomass within 25\u2003years and a slowed rate of ecosystem degradation because of fishing. However, full compliance costs the fishing industry about 30% of its annual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "iVezqKwAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15987146576525867231", "cites_id": ["15987146576525867231"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02064.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3zjtmRvB3d0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
