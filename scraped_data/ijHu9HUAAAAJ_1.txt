In this paper the basic relationships are discussed in the context of vertical transfer in the lower atmosphere, and the required corrections to the measured flux are derived.If the measurement involves sensing of the fluctuations or mean gradient of the constituent's mixing ratio relative to the dry air component, then no correction is required; while with sensing of the constituent's specific mass content relative to the total moist air, a correction arising from the water vapour flux only is required. Correspondingly, if in mean gradient measurements the constituent's density is measured in air from different heights \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 5034, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=219245098429727544", "cites_id": ["219245098429727544"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49710644707", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OEOmYkHqCgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 16, "1991": 13, "1992": 30, "1993": 32, "1994": 26, "1995": 48, "1996": 55, "1997": 44, "1998": 42, "1999": 62, "2000": 60, "2001": 62, "2002": 72, "2003": 87, "2004": 112, "2005": 146, "2006": 199, "2007": 193, "2008": 210, "2009": 178, "2010": 221, "2011": 226, "2012": 238, "2013": 261, "2014": 282, "2015": 266, "2016": 258, "2017": 245, "2018": 210, "2019": 222, "2020": 220, "2021": 239, "2022": 228, "2023": 87}}
