Mass balance equations for the time dependence of H2O and CO2 mol fractions within the leaf chamber were used to describe instrument function. Measurements for each run were fitted to an exponential function to estimate average rates of CO2 assimilation and transpiration during the measurement period. Stomatal conductances and intercellular CO2 mol fractions were also computed. Linear data analysis used in the LI\u20106200 produced similar results for assimilation rates, stomatal conductances and intercellular CO2 concentrations compared to a more rigorous nonlinear analysis, provided humidity within the chamber was kept constant during the measurement period. Instrument performance for CO2 fluxes was confirmed by injecting pure CO2 at steady rates from a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1882459330267294339", "cites_id": ["1882459330267294339"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1989.tb01236.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g6qzhMnWHxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
