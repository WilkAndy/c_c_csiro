These measurements provided estimates of transfer velocities for NH3 and water vapour in the air and for NH3 in the water (gNw). Ammonia fluxes were controlled by transport processes in both the atmosphere and the water. Diurnal variations of gNw appeared to be caused by changes in the relative strength of mechanical and buoyancy mixing forces in the turbid water. Stable stratification of the subsurface water layer until early afternoon was attributed to absorption of shortwave radiation, which caused gNw to decrease relative to that for neutrally stratified water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=556369853783668893", "cites_id": ["556369853783668893"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698184903809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nfiCKm-fuAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
