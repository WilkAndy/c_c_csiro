This method of fertilizer application resulted in fairly even distribution of applied nitrogen (N) within the soil profile down to the bottom of the plough layer and along the field in the direction of flow. At physiological maturity (76 days after fertilization) the data suggest that 57 kg of the applied N per hectare was recovered in the plant tops and the bulk of this (42 kg) was in the grain. Less than 2 kg N was lost as ammonia (NH,) and c. 2 kg N was emitted as nitrous oxide (N2O) during the first 23 days after fertilizer application, when most of the N not recovered by the sunflowers was lost. Slightly more than half of the N2O emitted was lost during the 11 days after fertilization, when NH+4 was being nitrified; the remainder was lost after a second irrigation by which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17772783103039722235", "cites_id": ["17772783103039722235"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9850684", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-1K_ZhGcpfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
