During the 3 complete years of the study, the annual balance of calcium was positive, the annual balance of magnesium was negative, and there was either a net gain or net loss of sodium and potassium depending on the amount of stream-flow. The order of mobility is sodium > potassium > magnesium > calcium, in accord with physicochemical properties. More calcium than sodium is returned annually from plant to soil by litter fall and leaching (biogeochemical cycling), yet the rate of loss of calcium in stream-water is less than one-twentieth that of sodium. The ecosystem is described as 'tight' in respect to calcium (the annual geochemical balance is con- sistently small relative to the amount cycled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3795812095455793029", "cites_id": ["3795812095455793029"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/bt9780189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hQ_GX_1urTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 2, "1980": 3, "1981": 2, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
