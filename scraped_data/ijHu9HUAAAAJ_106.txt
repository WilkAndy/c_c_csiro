Quantifying thisimportant source presents special difficulties because the animalsconstitute moving, heterogeneously distributed, intermittent, pointsources. There are two general approaches: one, from the bottom up,involves direct measurements of emissions from a known number ofanimals, and the other, from the top down, infers areal emissions ofCH4 from its atmospheric signature. A mass-balance methodproved successful for bottom-up verification. It permits undisturbedgrazing, has a simple theoretical basis and is appropriate for fluxmeasurements on small plots and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10528765870798717689", "cites_id": ["10528765870798717689"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1002604505377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-cI2lMawHZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
