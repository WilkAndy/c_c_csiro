The aircraft data were recorded during low-level flightsat 6 m above ground level and grid flights at altitudes of between 15 and 65 m, allin unstable atmospheric conditions. The low-level flights revealed an inadequate temperaturesensor response time, a correction for which was determined from subsequent work ina wind tunnel. Aircraft and ground-based measurements of mean wind speed, wind directionand air temperature agree to within 0.2 m s-1, 4\u00b0 and 0.9 \u00b0C respectively.Comparisons between aircraft and ground-based observations of the standarddeviations of vertical velocity, horizontal wind speed, air temperature and specifichumidity have slopes of 0.96, 0.97, 0.92 and 0.99 respectively but the observed scatter isroughly twice the random error expected due to the averaging length of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10037144239804717841", "cites_id": ["10037144239804717841"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026002301152", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ERvrzIEZS4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
