The study involved: a) the calculation of a range of physiologically-based vegetation indices from ASTER, HyMap, Hyperion and MOD43B NBAR imagery over the flux tower site; b) comparison across scales between HyMap, Hyperion and MODIS for the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the Red\u2013Green ratio; c) analysis of relationships between tower-based flux and light use efficiency (LUE) measurements and seasonal and climatic constraints on growth; and d) examination of relationships between fluxes, LUE and time series of NDVI, NDWI and Red\u2013Green ratio.
