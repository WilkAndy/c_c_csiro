This paper reports the use of micrometeorological and lysimetric methods to measure soil evaporation (Es) in the canopy of a wheat crop over a period of 7 weeks as the crop matured and green leaf area index (L) declined from 3.8 to 0.2. Simultaneous measurements of total canopy evaporation (E) were made by eddy correlation. The within-canopy micrometeorological methods employed a variance ratio approach and an inverse Lagrangian analysis. The pooled micrometeorological and lysimetric data conformed very well to the relationship E sE  = exp(\u22120.61L)  with an r2 value of 0.95. The relationship should be a useful empirical means for estimating daily or weekly Es in SVAT studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4969252429448660314", "cites_id": ["4969252429448660314"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007919469785567X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WsWIoMFU9kQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
