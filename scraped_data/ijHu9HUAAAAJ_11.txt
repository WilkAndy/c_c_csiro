These sites, independently managed and operated, voluntarily contributed their data to create global datasets. Data were quality controlled and processed using uniform methods, to improve consistency and intercomparability across sites. The dataset is already being used in a number of applications, including ecophysiology studies, remote sensing studies, and development of ecosystem and Earth system models. FLUXNET2015 includes derived-data products, such as gap-filled time series, ecosystem respiration and photosynthetic uptake estimates, estimation of uncertainties, and metadata about the measurements, presented \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 562, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5574411727586348629,12535836120017898798", "cites_id": ["5574411727586348629", "12535836120017898798"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0534-3;", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VU6Ohu5JXE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 23, "2021": 159, "2022": 249, "2023": 125}}
