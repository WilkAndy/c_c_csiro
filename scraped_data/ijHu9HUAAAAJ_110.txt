Combinations of leaf area index and stomatal sensitivity to humidity were assessed for their impact on water storage levels in two soils with differing water storage capacities. The model predicted that trees with low stomatal sensitivity to water vapour pressure deficit (vpd) or with high leaf area index (lai) will deplete soil water more rapidly than trees sensitive to vpd or with low lai. Trees with stomata insensitive to vpd would have to endure longer periods of severe water stress and would be less likely to survive then trees with stomata responsive to vdp. Differences in stomatal sensitivity to humidity resulted in no net annual change in soil water storage when soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12274531125417447952", "cites_id": ["12274531125417447952"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037837749190042H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EJL7egblV6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
