As part of the project objective of developing methodologies to detect, locate, and quantify potential leakage of the stored fluid into the atmosphere, we formulate an inverse atmospheric model based on a Bayesian probabilistic framework coupled to a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art backward Lagrangian particle dispersion model. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used for efficiently sampling the posterior probability distribution of the source parameters. Controlled experiments used to test the model involved releases of the injected fluid from one of the nearby wells and were staggered over 1 month.
