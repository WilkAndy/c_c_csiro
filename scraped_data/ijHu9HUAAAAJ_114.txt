In this work we use non-linear parameter estimation to determine the vertical profile of the Lagrangian time scale that simultaneously optimises agreement between modelled and measured vertical profiles of temperature, water vapour and carbon dioxide concentrations within a 40-m tall temperate Eucalyptus forest in south-eastern Australia. Modelled temperature and concentration profiles are generated using Lagrangian dispersion theory combined with source/sink distributions of sensible heat, water vapour and CO2. These distributions are derived \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7387350289956640599", "cites_id": ["7387350289956640599"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-008-9344-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V5c-6PIjhWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
