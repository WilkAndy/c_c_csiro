Plant, Cell Environ. 20 (1997) 537\u00b1557] published a paper that integrated nitrogen and light profiles separately for sun and shade leaves in a canopy, and combined these with a current biochemically based model of leaf photosynthesis. It was shown that this gave good agreement with the output of a multi-layered model with the same biochemical properties. Wang and Leuning [Wang, Y.-P., Leuning, R. A two-leaf model for canopy conductance, photosynthesis and partitioning of available energy. I. Model description and comparison with a multi-layered model. Agric, For. Meteor. 91 (1998) 89\u00b1111] repeated the comparison of the sun/shade model and a multi-layered model, but reported that the agreement was poor, and developed what was reported to be an alternative treatment, with a more robust approach. We show here that their alternative, while appearing to be more complicated, is mathematically identical with our sun/shade model, and that the discrepancy they reported was caused by their coding error. The issue of tuning of such models is discussed.\u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science BV All rights reserved."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1745678502122511718", "cites_id": ["1745678502122511718"], "pub_url": "https://userweb.weihenstephan.de/lattanzi/Lit/de%20Pury%20&%20Farquhar%201999.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zl0MQ1nlORgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
