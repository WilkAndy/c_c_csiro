The accuracy of these estimates of the flux are heavily dependent on the reliability of the measurements of the very small gradients of mean windspeed, temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations above the forest, and on the proper determination of the aerodynamic parameters of the forest; viz., the zero plane displacement d, the roughness length z0 or a friction coefficient Cf. d, z0 and Cf were determined from wind profiles under neutral conditions on the assumption that the logarithmic law is valid for measurements made \u201cclose\u201d to the roughness elements. It was further assumed that these parameters are independent of atmospheric stability, and that d may be identified with the height of the mean sink for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6694808190005329340", "cites_id": ["6694808190005329340"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002157178900134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vL2kBJS86FwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 3, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
