Good agreement was found between predicted and measured leaf temperatures on clear nights. Leaf temperatures were controlled mainly by loss of thermal radiation to cold skies and by gain of sensible and latent heat from surrounding air. Leaves with condensation on them were 1-2 \u00b0C warmer than dry leaves under otherwise similar ambient conditions. Free convection was unimportant relative to forced convection as a mechanism for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12948889831055214208", "cites_id": ["12948889831055214208"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1989.0044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gMa297Gys7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
