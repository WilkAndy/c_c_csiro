However, estimates of GPP at various flux stations indicate that the MODIS algorithm may (i) over-predict GPP at sites where limitation to growth by low-soil water content is not adequately captured by the reduction in stomatal conductance by vapor pressure and (ii) under-predict GPP in highly productive, evergreen, needle leaf forests, due to a reduced radiation-use-efficiency term. The objective of this paper is to determine if any systematic bias exists in the MODIS algorithm relative to eddy covariance (EC) estimates of GPP made over an evergreen, needle leaf temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, Canada, which is routinely water-stressed in summer months. Results indicate that 8-day GPP as predicted by the standard MODIS algorithm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1916802787576764276", "cites_id": ["1916802787576764276"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192307001700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dNf9yfrZmRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
