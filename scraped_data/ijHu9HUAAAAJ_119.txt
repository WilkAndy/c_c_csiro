Geosequestration offers a potentially effective greenhouse gas control measure and is being proposed at a significant scale in Australia and overseas.The greenhouse gas, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), is captured from a fossil fuel or industrial waste gas stream for subsequent storage. Alternative forms of sequestration, such as in the deep ocean or in solid carbonates, have also been considered but geosequestration appears to be the most promising."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12769687455009162865", "cites_id": ["12769687455009162865"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12769687455009162865&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cUaVaBULN7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
