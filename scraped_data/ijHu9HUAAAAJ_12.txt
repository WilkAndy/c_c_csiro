Despite the extremes of canopy structure, the two vegetation types have similar maximum hourly evaporation rates (E max) and maximum surface conductances (gsmax) (medians = 0.46 mm h-1 and 22 mm s-1). However, on a daily basis, median E max of coniferous forest (4.0 mm d-1) is significantly lower than that of grassland (4.6 mm d-1). Additionally, a representative value of ga for coniferous forest (200 mm s-1) is an order of magnitude more than the corresponding value for grassland (25 mm s-1). The proportional sensitivity of E, calculated by the Penman-Monteith equation, to changes in gs is >0.7 for coniferous forest, but as low as 0.3 for grassland. The proportional sensitivity of E to changes in ga is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 462, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1144033646883511010", "cites_id": ["1144033646883511010"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00323485", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4hqWXYps4A8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 10, "1995": 10, "1996": 10, "1997": 14, "1998": 21, "1999": 17, "2000": 17, "2001": 19, "2002": 10, "2003": 12, "2004": 20, "2005": 17, "2006": 16, "2007": 21, "2008": 26, "2009": 9, "2010": 12, "2011": 23, "2012": 19, "2013": 14, "2014": 29, "2015": 20, "2016": 10, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 19, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
