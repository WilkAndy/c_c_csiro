These methods include: a Eulerian second\u2010order closure model (EUL); a localized near\u2010field Lagrangian dispersion model (LNF); and a hybrid model (HEL) which uses the Eulerian second\u2010order turbulence model to calculate the flow statistics combined with the regression analysis used with the Lagrangian model. Model predictions were compared to heat flux profiles measured at five levels in the canopy, and to CO2 and water\u2010vapour fluxes measured close to the ground and above the forest. Predictions of sensible\u2010heat flux profiles by the LNF and HEL schemes were systematically better than results from the EUL analysis. This improvement was attributed to the redundancy in the measured profile (scalar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10192330801195636383", "cites_id": ["10192330801195636383"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1256/qj.02.108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n9aJxtxuco0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
