Inputs are the profiles of mean gas concentration and turbulence within and above the canopy. The analysis provides a bridge between chamber and cuvette measurements on soil and foliage elements and flux measurements on a field scale.Mass balance methods are appropriate for flux measurements in small ecosystems, tens of meters in lateral extent.
