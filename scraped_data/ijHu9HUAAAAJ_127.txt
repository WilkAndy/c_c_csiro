Yet, the usefulness of nonlinear, ecohydrological pulse response functions to predict regional-scale patterns of annual ANPP at decadal scales remains unclear. Here, we assessed how different pulse response (PR) models compete with simple linear statistical models to capture variability in yearly integrated values of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIint), a remotely sensed proxy of annual ANPP. We examined 24-year-long time series of NDVIint calculated from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI for 350,000 km2 of tropical grasslands in northern Australia. Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, PR models clearly outperformed statistical models when parameters were optimized for each site but all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11940060373515186679", "cites_id": ["11940060373515186679"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-010-9403-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9zEXCKads6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
