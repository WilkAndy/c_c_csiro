However, large-scale industrial storage sites will have a surface footprint of many tens of square kilometres. Atmospheric tomography can be used to determine the location and area of an unknown source using an array of instruments that measure atmospheric concentrations of the leaking gas or its tracer(s). We have completed a detailed simulation study that uses synthetic concentration perturbations downwind of a source at an unknown location within an array of point samplers to test the feasibility of using \u2018atmospheric tomography\u2019 to locate the source. The results of this simulation are extremely encouraging and suggest that the limiting factor in a tomographic method of leakage location detection is largely the need to gather enough wind directions to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17667624352337149003", "cites_id": ["17667624352337149003"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211004747", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S7wYyr0CMPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
