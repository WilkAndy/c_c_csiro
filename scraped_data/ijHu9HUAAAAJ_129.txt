The site is the onshore Otway Basin in western Victoria. The target reservoir is the gas producing Waarre Formation, which forms a proven reservoir/seal pair with the overlying Belfast Mudstone. The storage site is a tilted fault block containing the depleted Naylor gas accumulation which was produced through the Naylor\u20131 well and abandoned in 2002. The CO2CRC has drilled an injection well, CRC\u20131, 300 m downdip from Naylor\u20131. Up to 100,000 tonnes of CO 2 mixed stream (80% CO 2, 20% CH 4) will be injected, at super-critical state, into the Waarre Formation, unit C. The CO 2-rich gas will migrate updip and accumulate at the top of the structure around Naylor\u20131. Atmospheric tracer compounds, which are either introduced compounds injected with the CO 2 or naturally occurring isotopes of CO 2 will act as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6458550714200408567", "cites_id": ["6458550714200408567"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/aj/AJ07061", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:98HC26dhoVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
