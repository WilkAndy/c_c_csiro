Test leaves were subjected to a range of temperatures, humidities, photon irradiances and external CO2 mol fractions. An empiral function, gsw = g0 + g1 Ahs/(cs-I'), was able to account for steady- state stomatal conductances g*sw, over a wide range of environmental conditions and leaf photosynthetic capacities. In this equation, termed the stomatal constraint function, A is CO2 assimilation rate, hs and cs are relative humidity and CO2 mol fraction at the leaf surface respectively, I' is the CO2 compensation point, g0 is conductance at A = 0 and gl is an empirical coefficient. Equations describing the supply of CO2 through stomata and demand for CO2 in photosynthesis were solved simultaneously with the constraint \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 454, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8418056965669486358", "cites_id": ["8418056965669486358"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP9900159", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fn-7oTXy0nQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 6, "1992": 5, "1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 13, "1996": 12, "1997": 11, "1998": 18, "1999": 5, "2000": 11, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 20, "2004": 22, "2005": 13, "2006": 13, "2007": 15, "2008": 24, "2009": 21, "2010": 17, "2011": 24, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 16, "2015": 13, "2016": 16, "2017": 16, "2018": 23, "2019": 18, "2020": 7, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 9}}
