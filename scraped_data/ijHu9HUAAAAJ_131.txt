R. Raupach, which allows the identification of canopy sources and sinks from measurements of the mean concentration profiles and certain statistics of the turbulence in the canopy. Inverse Lagrangian analysis allows people to identify the sites of heat, vapor, and gas exchange in plant canopies, thus permitting study of the physiology of plants in the field in a non\u2010disturbing, continuous way and separation of the soil and plant contributions to the net canopy exchange. Practical considerations in the application of inverse Lagrangian analysis include selecting the appropriate number of source layers, appropriate instrumentation, the use of constraints, and the need for testing the fine detail of the analysis against independent flux measurements. The chapter outlines the methodology of the analysis and examines the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7993922450173194837", "cites_id": ["7993922450173194837"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronmonogr47.c21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VfKXZB0e8G4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
