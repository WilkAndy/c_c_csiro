Results are given of a study, conducted during the spring of 1995, on the analysis of a key parameter in the model, maximum canopy conductance (Gcmax), for six patches (with pasture, or wheat, oats or triticale crop) along a 100-km transect in south-east Australia. The latent heat flux of the region was estimated using Gcmax for the different patches, weighted by their area fractions in the region, and the results were compared with latent heat fluxes measured using instrumented aircraft flights."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10020536076582637508", "cites_id": ["10020536076582637508"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9780851996776.0175", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xM-xd3gYEIsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
