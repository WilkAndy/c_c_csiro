The correct Figure 2 is shown below, along with the corresponding amended text for paragraph 15. The rest of the paper is correct, and the senior author apologizes for the error.[2] Contour plots of the evaporative fraction, fE= lE/A, as predicted by the evaporation model, are shown in Figure 2 as a function of Qh and Lai \u00c2 100 for values of Da= 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 kPa. Increasing Da for any combination of Qh and Lai results in an increase in evaporative fraction; for example, fE is predicted to increase from 0.52 to 0.68 for Qh= 300 W m\u00c02 and Lai= 3 as Da increases from 0.5 to 2.0 kPa. The contour spacing decreases with increasing Da, indicating increasing sensitivity of fE to variations in humidity deficit and leaf area index at higher humidity deficits. Sensitivity of fE to Lai is greatest at low values of Qh and vice versa."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18231589230586491555", "cites_id": ["18231589230586491555"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helen-Cleugh/publication/251424148_A_simple_surface_conductance_model_to_estimate_regional_evaporation_using_MODIS_leaf_area_index_and_the_Penman-Monteith_equation_vol_45_W10419_2008/links/542134030cf203f155c61605/A-simple-surface-conductance-model-to-estimate-regional-evaporation-using-MODIS-leaf-area-index-and-the-Penman-Monteith-equation-vol-45-W10419-2008.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o_LxY8-dA_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
