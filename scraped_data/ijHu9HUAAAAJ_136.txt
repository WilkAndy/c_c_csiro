The anemometer determined the windspeed with a root-mean-square (rms) error of 5%, and the direction with an rms error of 5.6 \u00b0. A comparison between omnidirectional and sonic anemometers in the field gave practically identical results for the vertical sensible heat flux using eddy correlation procedures. Other turbulence statistics are also reported. The new instrument should be useful for measurements in canopies, where turbulence intensities are often large."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17210112722210462919", "cites_id": ["17210112722210462919"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00122294", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xxzJd1aa1u4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
