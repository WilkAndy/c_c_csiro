This figure incorrectly showed that photosynthesis of shaded leaves calculated by the model of de Pury and Farquhar (1997, hereafter dF97) was too highly relative to results from a multilayer model. This error resulted from a mistake in the computer code we used to calculate total radiation absorption and photosynthesis of sunlit and shaded leaves in our reconstruction of the dF97 model, and for sunlit leaves in WL98. The error did not apply to calculation of photosynthesis of shaded leaves in WL98 because the total absorbed radiation was not used in the calculations (see Appendix D of WL98). The mistake occurred in translating Eqs. B3b and B4 in WL98 to computer code, whereby the quantity \u03a8fk\u221a bYj \u00e1 kbg in the second term of the right-hand side of both equations was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5462336166112329186", "cites_id": ["5462336166112329186"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192399000398", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4v3kaM0dzksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
