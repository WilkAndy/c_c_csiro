The model for Gs has six parameters that represent canopy physiological processes and soil evaporation: gsx, maximum stomatal conductance; Q50 and D50, the values of solar radiation and atmospheric humidity deficit when the stomatal conductance is half its maximum; kQ and kA, extinction coefficients for visible radiation and available energy; and f, the ratio of soil evaporation to the equilibrium rate corresponding to the energy absorbed at the soil surface. Model parameters were estimated using 2\u20133 years of data from 15 flux station sites covering a wide range of climate and vegetation types globally. The PM estimates of E are best when all six parameters in the Gs model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 452, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12707308091226687983", "cites_id": ["12707308091226687983"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007wr006562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:74kD_WFtWbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 9, "2010": 11, "2011": 21, "2012": 13, "2013": 26, "2014": 20, "2015": 34, "2016": 29, "2017": 32, "2018": 38, "2019": 31, "2020": 36, "2021": 67, "2022": 55, "2023": 27}}
