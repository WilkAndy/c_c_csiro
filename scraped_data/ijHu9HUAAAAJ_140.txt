Ice then formed simultaneously throughout the supercooled region, releasing latent heat of fusion and raising the temperature of the ice-water-soil mixture to near 0 degrees. Only a small fraction (typically 3 percent) of the water froze at this time. Soil temperatures in the freezing zone remained constant for 1-6 h until the available water had changed phase but then temperatures declined steadily. Water movement to this layer from below prolonged the duration of the isothermal period. Heat released by the freezing of water accounted for more than half of the energy gained by the frozen zone. In dry soils, temperatures declined continuously and were several degrees lower than for moist soils at dawn. Implications on the survival of germinating seeds and the roots of young seedlings are considered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14130631806989214358", "cites_id": ["14130631806989214358"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU8603660", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lqJt28IWGsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
