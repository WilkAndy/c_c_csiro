The concentration profiles are related to the source-sink distributions through a matrix of linear equations, a'dispersion matrix', in which the coefficients are functions of the standard deviation of the vertical wind velocity, and TL, the Lagrangian time-scale. The Inverse Lagrangian analysis inverts the dispersion matrix to calculate the source/sink distributions from the mean concentration profiles and profiles of \u0192\u00d0w and TL. Thus the technique allows separate identification of, say, the respiration of CO2 at the soil(or paddy water) surface and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by plants in the canopy. The observations and the computational scheme required for such applications are relatively simple. The paper describes the use of the technique to infer sources of heat, water vapour and CO2 in a wheat crop."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14105335761958093711", "cites_id": ["14105335761958093711"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/agrmet1943/52/5/52_5_441/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j0MgaSQ4wMMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
