Ground cover and leaf area index were derived from the LiDAR dataset while chlorophyll content maps were generated from the hyperspectral imagery using 3D radiative transfer models and the structural information derived from the LiDAR. These maps were subsequently used to replace fixed parameters in land surface models (LSM). We used the LSM CABLE-SLI to demonstrate how spatial variability in biophysical parameters translates into changes in net ecosystem exchange."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4330906427011672249", "cites_id": ["4330906427011672249"], "pub_url": "https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/3d-spatial-distribution-of-biophysical-parameters-derived-from-hy", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uah8AXN4GjwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
