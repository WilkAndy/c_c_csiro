Owing to spatial continuity, remotely sensed (RS) data are often used to drive models to estimate spatially distributed ET (ETRS). The Terra/MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite data are commonly used together with ET models to estimate ETRS (Cleugh et al. 2007, Leuning et al. 2007, Zhang and Wegehenkel 2006). This is because MODIS, flying aboard NASA's TERRA and AQUA satellites, is high radiometric sensitive with high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution, and it is free of charge.The validation of ETRS is generally conducted at point/plot scale by using measurements from eddycovariance or Bowen-ratio energy balance methods. The point ET validation can evaluate the temporal variation of ETRS, but it cannot assess spatial patterns of ETRS. Some attempt has been made to validate ETRS against catchment scale estimates of ET based on water balance (Bastiaanssen et al. 2005), which, however focuses on only several catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13717738330845444991", "cites_id": ["13717738330845444991"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/2007/cleughha_xa.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f3vNC1UyX74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2}}
