The overarching objective of FLUXNET is to provide an infrastructure for the synthesis and analysis of long-term carbon, water and energy flux data that are being acquired world-wide by various regional flux networks. FLUXNET is a network of regional networks. Information compiled by the FLUXNET project will be used by the EOS validation community to validate remote sensing algorithms associated with the MODIS instrument on the Terra satellite. Products to be generated by the MODLAND group and validated by FLUXNET measurements include leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation, evaporation and net primary productivity (MODIS 12, 15, 16 and 17 activities). The overall FLUXNET strategy is summarized in the FLUXNET Overview provided on the Web page."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6795464160107961227", "cites_id": ["6795464160107961227"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6795464160107961227&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ixsiU6ZWTl4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
