Lack of energy closure by eddy covariance measurements is commonly observed for Euroflux and Ameriflux installations. Reasons for the underestimates of H+ \u03bb E may result from the way water vapor concentrations are determined using closed-path infrared gas analyzers. A comparison of open-and closed-path analyzers show that energy closure to better than 95% can be achieved with both systems when water vapor concentrations are expressed as mixing ratios in dry air, along with careful choice of the coordinate framework and the averaging periods used to calculate fluxes.
