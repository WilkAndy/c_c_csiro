Either eddy fluxes are underestimated or A is overestimated. Reasons for the imbalance are: (1) a failure to satisfy the fundamental assumption of one-dimensional transport that is necessary for measurements on a single tower to represent spatially-averaged fluxes to/from the underlying surface, and (2) measurement errors in eddy fluxes, net radiation and changes in energy storage in soils, air and biomass below the measurement height. Radiometer errors are unlikely to overestimate A significantly, but phase lags caused by incorrect estimates of the energy storage terms can explain why H+\u03bbE systematically underestimates A at half-hourly time scales. Energy closure is observed at only 8% of flux sites in the La Thuile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 433, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17506565680465434167", "cites_id": ["17506565680465434167"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819231100339X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N9YvjbvQ8_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 21, "2014": 24, "2015": 40, "2016": 50, "2017": 38, "2018": 45, "2019": 70, "2020": 46, "2021": 35, "2022": 40, "2023": 16}}
