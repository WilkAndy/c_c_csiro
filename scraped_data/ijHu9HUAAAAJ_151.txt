Both contributed to the code development and N. Vuichard contributed to the processing of the ERA-Interim data downscaling. Furthermore, the contribution of the co-author Frank Tiedemann was re-evaluated relative to the colleague Corinna Rebmann, both working at the same sites, and based on this re-evaluation a substitution in the co-author list is implemented (with Rebmann replacing Tiedemann). Finally, two affiliations were listed incorrectly and are corrected here (entries 190 and 193). The author list and affiliations have been amended to address these omissions in both the HTML and PDF versions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1040263676309486540", "cites_id": ["1040263676309486540"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00851-9", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
