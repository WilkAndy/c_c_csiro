Atmospheric techniques have been used to monitor Australia\u2019s first geosequestration project, the CO2CRC Otway Project, since its inception (Etheridge et al. 2011; Jenkins et al. 2011). These techniques have been developed to be sensitive (detecting small potential leakage signals against large and variable background CO2 concentrations and fluxes), specific (attributing variations to sources using chemical and isotopic fingerprints and dispersion modelling) and practical (continuous remote operation) (Leuning et al. 2008; Luhar et al. 2009). A recent stage of the Otway project involved periods of controlled releases of injected gas at the surface that could mimic leakage. This provided a test of the original atmospheric scheme, complemented by additional measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and carbon isotopes of CO2. Based on the experience at Otway and recent results from the new Arcturus baseline atmospheric station in Queensland, this presentation will consider the potential merits of atmospheric techniques for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from emerging energy technologies such as geosequestration and coal seam methane. \u00a9 2011 CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11446476228825934512", "cites_id": ["11446476228825934512"], "pub_url": "https://dspace101.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/9526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sGof7XsN2p4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
