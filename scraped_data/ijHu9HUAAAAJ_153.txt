Our aim was to shed light on the effect of local and regional vegetation on biogenic aerosol formation in a remote area largely free of anthropogenic influences. Previous work on aerosol precursors in native Australian forests is all but nonexistent: VOC emissions have been studied only on 15 of the 500\u2013800 Australian Eucalypt species. Formation events were most frequent when wind arrived from the agricultural/pasture lowlands dotted with native Eucalypt woodlands. However, the largest volumes of intermediate particles came from the native Eucalypt forest. The high limonene concentration observed at a pasture site suggested that Australian croplands and pastures could be a strong source of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5112346737102982846", "cites_id": ["5112346737102982846"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6475-3_202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vo6mYUW08kYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
