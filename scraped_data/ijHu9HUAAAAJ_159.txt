We present here a history of the development of our work in this domain. While we have principally focused on optimising the use of long term, fixed location, high precision monitoring, paired with both forward and inverse modelling techniques suitable either local or regional scales, we have also incorporated mobile ground surveys and flux calculations from plumes in some contexts. We initially developed leak detection methodologies for geological carbon storage at a local scale using a Bayesian probabilistic approach coupled to a backward Lagrangian particle dispersion model (Luhar et al. JGR, 2014), and single point monitoring with sector analysis (Etheridge et al. In prep.) We have since expanded our modelling techniques to regional scales using both forward and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.3404L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
