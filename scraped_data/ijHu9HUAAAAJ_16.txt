Fluxes were measured using micrometeorological methods and neural network analysis was used to fill gaps in the hourly flux time series. Productivity at Virginia Park is controlled by rainfall amount and timing during the wet season since this determines the leaf area index (Lai) of the C4 grass understorey which varies greatly compared to Lai of the trees. The savanna lost 99gCm\u22122 over the period July 2001\u2013March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002\u20132003 wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510gCm\u22122 from February 2001 to March 2004 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 388, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=327525554371216052", "cites_id": ["327525554371216052"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192305000079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tMIoo8GaiwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 12, "2007": 25, "2008": 33, "2009": 20, "2010": 17, "2011": 36, "2012": 24, "2013": 27, "2014": 26, "2015": 36, "2016": 24, "2017": 16, "2018": 21, "2019": 16, "2020": 21, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
