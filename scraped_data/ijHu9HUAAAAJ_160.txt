The measurements are used to develop atmospheric methods for operational monitoring of large scale CO 2 geological storage. Characterization of emission rates ideally requires concentration measurements upwind and downwind of the source, along with knowledge of the atmospheric turbulence field. Because only a single measurement location was available for much of the measurement period, we develop techniques to filter the record and to construct a'; pseudo-upwind'measurement from our dataset. Carbon dioxide and methane concentrations were filtered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.A53H..07L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
