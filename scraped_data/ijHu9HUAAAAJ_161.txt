If water and carbon fluxes are to be interpreted jointly (eg, to analyse water use effiency), they should be estimated in conceptually coupled approach that recognised the physiological role of stomatal control. In previous research using 16 flux towers world-wide (Yebra et al., 2013) we demonstrated that dry canopy canopy conductance (Gc) can be estimated from optical remote sensing and provides better ET estimates than alternative, more empirical approaches. Here we present a GPP estimation method that is explicitly coupled to ET by using the same satellite-based estimates of Gc and does not require vegetation class \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.B43H..06Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
