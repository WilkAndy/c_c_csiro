Diagnosing the climate controls over these fluxes is not simple but key to improving prediction and understanding of water and carbon cycle-climate interactions. We use a novel technique to investigate the variability of the fluxes from daily to multiannual timescales. We rank direct controlling factors of climate on water use and carbon uptake (changes in radiation, temperature, humidity) and indirect factors (disturbance triggered by changes in climate conditions). Direct climate impacts depend on the time scale under consideration but are generally strongest on the annual time scale. To investigate the spatio-temporal variability caused by disturbance we use NDVI and albedo. They provide information on status and dynamics of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.2709V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
