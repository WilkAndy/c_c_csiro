The aim was to assess optimal approaches in using optical remote sensing to estimate ET. The first two approaches directly regressed various MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) products with ET and evaporative fraction. In the third approach, the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation was inverted to obtain surface conductance (Gs), represented by days dominated by dry canopy conductance (Gc). The Gc values were then regressed against the MODIS vegetation products and used to parameterize the PM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.B22A..05Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
