Key properties of natural vegetation, such as projected cover, rooting depth and phenology, vary from catchment to catchment and within each catchment at various time scales. Furthermore, the increase in atmospheric CO2 will create environmental conditions in the future that are presently not observable anywhere in nature. It is therefore not helpful to base hydrological predictions on models that are either calibrated to reproduce observations from the past or use such observations as input. The present study tests an optimality-based approach of modelling the interactions between vegetation and the catchment water balance, which does not rely on calibration or prior knowledge about the vegetation at a particular site.
