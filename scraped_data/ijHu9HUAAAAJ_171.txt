The associated horizontal and vertical advective fluxes cannot be measured using instrumentation on the single towers typically used at micrometeorological sites. A common approach to minimize bias is to use a threshold in friction velocity, u*, to exclude periods when advection is assumed to be important, but this is problematic in situations when in canopy flows are decoupled from the flow above. Using data from 25 flux stations in a wide variety of forest ecosystems globally, we examine the generality of a novel approach to estimating nocturnal respiration developed by van Gorsel et al.(2007, Tellus, 59B, 307-403). The approach is based on the assumption that advection is small \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009EGUGA..11.2074V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
