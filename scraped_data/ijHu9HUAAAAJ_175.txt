Understanding of the dynamics that lead to a decoupling and knowledge of the characteristics of in-canopy flows is of particular importance when interpreting nocturnal exchanges of CO2 and trace fluxes.LF Richardson (1920) was the first to state that turbulence in the atmosphere should die away if the static stability exceeds the square of the mean shear. GI Taylor (1931) then was able to demonstrate that for certain idealized flows this would happen when local Richardson numbers exceed \u00bc. Later Miles (1961, 1986) and Howard (1961) generalized Taylor\u2019s results to a large class of inviscid stably stratified fluids in steady shear flows. Raupach et al.(1996) argued that the active turbulence near the top of a forest canopy is patterned on a plane mixing layer, which forms around the inflected mean velocity profile. The strong shear at canopy top allows for hydrodynamic instabilities to form. In the canopy, however, the different transport mechanisms of heat and momentum at leaf level, lead to wind speed profiles that approach the leaf surface value of zero much faster than air temperature approaches the leaf surface temperature (Belcher et al. 2008). When the atmosphere above the canopy is stably stratified, this difference in wind and temperature gradients results in supercritical Richardson numbers below the canopy top and a collapse of in-canopy turbulence. We discuss observed flow characteristics; show how they change in the transition from the convective to the stable boundary layer and how they can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/13120309/139191.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RtPqR4w7sWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
