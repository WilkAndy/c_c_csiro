The presence of advective transport is identified using the time series of CO2 concentrations. Given a continuous input of carbon (soil-, wood-and leaf respiration) into a control volume (CV) we expect concentrations in that control volume to increase through time if there is no flux through the upper lid and no advective transport. Time series measurements usually show a strong increase in carbon concentration once the atmosphere is stably stratified, but after this initially strong increase the temporal build-up of concentrations is slower and may even remain relatively constant. As this steady-state situation is not associated with fluxes through the top of the CV we can assume that advection is draining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B33E1661V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
