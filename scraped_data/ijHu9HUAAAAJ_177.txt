This presentation will briefly outline several innovative model evaluation techniques that demonstrate the increased depth of understanding projects such as Fluxnet can provide to the LSM community. Issues addressed include: efficiency of utilisation of information available to LSMs in predicting fluxes; the meaning of calibration in the context of systematic model bias, and; the appropriateness of vegetation type divisions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B33E1660A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
