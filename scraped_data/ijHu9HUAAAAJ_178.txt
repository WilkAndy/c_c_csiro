Such models require vertical profiles of the standard deviation of the vertical windspeed (\u03c3w) and the Lagrangian timescale (\u03c4L). While (\u03c3w) can be measured,(\u03c4L) cannot, and is usually either parameterised hypothetically or inferred from its Eulerian counterpart, and thus remains uncertain. In this work, we measure (\u03c3w) and infer (\u03c4L) from measured profiles of temperature and concentrations of H2O, CO2 and CH4, measured simultaneously by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study site is a 40-m tall temperate Eucalyptus forest in south-eastern Australia. Source/sink distributions of these quantities are derived from a multilayer Soil Vegetation Atmospheric Transfer (SVAT) model with multiple constraints:(1) day-time eddy flux measurements above the canopy of sensible \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B13B1182H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
