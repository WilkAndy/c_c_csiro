The potential escape of the geologically stored CO2 to the atmosphere is one of the main concerns of project operators, regulators, the carbon trade and the public. Although rates of escape large enough to endanger health and safety are extremely unlikely, low leak rates could reduce the effectiveness of geosequestration in controlling emissions. Monitoring geosequestration sites will be a requirement and atmospheric monitoring is part of an overall package, together with subsurface monitoring techniques. Atmospheric monitoring of a CO2 storage site will provide advantages such as relatively low cost and minimal intervention but also presents challenges because of the typically high and variable concentrations and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.H13F1652E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
