CLM3 has known biases in the surface energy partitioning as a result of deficiencies in its parameterizations. Such models however need to be robust for multi-decadal global climate simulations. Fluxnet now provides an extensive data source for investigating land processes since it encompasses a global range of ecosystem-climate interactions. Data from 22 Fluxnet sites are used to identify model deficiencies. Process-based knowledge from these observations can help to improve (a) physical processes and (b) reduce uncertainty of empirical parameters in the model. Including a prognostic aquifer and a new bare soil evaporation resistance formulation results in a significantly improved soil hydrology and energy partitioning. Terrestrial water storage increased by up to 300 mm in warm climates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B31E..08O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
