The predicted daily evaporation flux (ERS) compared well to measurements (the linear regression of modelled mean daily ERS versus measurements had a slope= 0.96, intercept= 0.04 mm/d and R 2= 0.99.) when the two parameters were optimised using measured E.We then used the model to estimate eight-day and annual average ERS at 1 km resolution for the entire the Murray\u0153Darling Basin (MDB) from 2001 to 2005. The two parameters in the Gs model were optimised using steady-state water balance estimates (precipitation minus run-off) in the gauged catchments in three precipitation zones of the MDB, and the calibrated evaporation model was then used to estimate evaporation (ERS) and run-off from gauged and ungauged catchments in the MDB. Mean annual ERS estimates compared well with water balance estimates, indicated by a root mean square error (RMSE) of 80.9 mm/yr and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (CE) of 0.66. Reasonable agreement was obtained between the estimated mean annual run-off (RRS)(rainfall minus ERS) and the measured run-off (RMSE= 65.9 mm/y, and CE= 0.79)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30775172/HydrologicalClimateChangeProgram07_WFHC_File_Standard.pdf#page=71", "cites_per_year": {}}
