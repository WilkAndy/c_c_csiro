The potential escape of the geologically stored C02 to the atmosphere is one of the main concerns of project operators, regulators (including carbon accounting) and the public. Although rates of escape large enough to endanger health and safety are extremely unlikely, low leak rates could reduce the effectiveness of geosequestration in controlling emissions. Monitoring geosequestration sites will be a requirement and atmospheric monitoring will be part of an overall package, together with geophysical, geochemical, and hydrological techniques. Atmospheric monitoring of a C02 storage site will provide advantages such as relatively low cost and minimal intervention but also presents challenges because of the typically high and variable concentrations and fluxes of C02 in the atmosphere. Our modelling of hypothetical leaks from C02 storage and dispersion into the atmosphere suggests that identifying and quantifying emissions to the atmosphere may be possible with a combination of atmospheric techniques. These include the continuous and precise monitoring of C02, naturally occurring tracers such as C02 isotopes, and introduced tracers, together with the measurement and modeling of transport and C02 fluxes, over several special scales. An atmospheric monitoring strategy incorporating these techniques has been deployed at the C02CRC's Otway Basin Pilot Project in Victoria. This is Australia's first geosequestration project and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20963649", "cites_per_year": {}}
