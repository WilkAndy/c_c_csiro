The measured size range was 0.34\u201340 nm. Daytime aerosol formation took place on 52% of days with acceptable data. This is approximately twice as often as in a pine forest in Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4, southern Finland. Possible reasons are the lack of a cold, dark winter which would suppress precursor concentrations and photochemical reactions; weather that is generally drier and sunnier than in Finland; and weaker anthropogenic influence which leads to lower average background concentrations of aerosols. Average growth rates (GR) for 1.3\u20133 nm and 3\u20137 nm particles were the same as in Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 but the 7\u201320 nm particles grew 50% faster in Tumbarumba than in Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4. Also, unlike in Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6475-3_177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d_8D6_rKKFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
