Here we present measurements collected from an agricultural soil in Victoria, Australia. Measurements of the isotopic composition of nitrous oxide (including the relative fractionation of 14N15N16O and 15N14N16O (SP)), N2O flux, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) concentration, and soil moisture, were collected during a 2 week field campaign. Soils were treated with either 10 atom% 15N ammonium or nitrate, and then irrigated. Nitrate treatments were observed to emit 7-15% of the applied nitrogen as nitrous oxide, whilst the ammonium treatments emitted 0.4-0.6%. The nitrate treatments also showed a decrease in the SP as the soil dried.
