Cleugh et al. developed a satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) algorithm based on the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, which uses surface meteorological measurements and surface conductance estimated via MODIS NDVI and LAI. The algorithm is applied to the globe using ECMWF daily met data, 16-day albedo and NDVI from MOD43C1, MOD15 8-day LAI in 2001. Ecosystem-level measurements of latent heat flux at eddy covariance flux towers offer opportunities for validating the MODIS ET products. Here, we report results for such comparisons at several sites varying widely in biome type and land use. Preliminary comparison shows good agreement between modeled and measured ET across various fluxtowers in 2001."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUSM.H34B..06M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
