This study was designed to investigate the extent of spatial variability of N2O emissions in an irrigated, grazed pasture and the contributing mechanisms. 100 minichambers (15 cm diameter) were placed over~ 1 ha of irrigated dairy pasture in southeastern Australia to measure N2O fluxes. Soil properties (soil moisture, bulk density, pH, mineral N, total N and C) under each chamber were measured. Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil variables were analysed using geostatistics to discern the spatial patterns and to examine effects of soil properties on N2O emissions. The experiment was conducted twice, in February and in April 2004, soon after two separate events of urea application with follow-up irrigation. The spatial variation of N2O fluxes was huge, ranging from 20 to 900 ngN-N2O m-2 s-1 and the N2O fluxes showed spatial autocorrelation below 77 and 74m, respectively. The average N2O fluxes from the 100 minichambers were 160 and 143 ng N-N2O m-2 s-1 for the two experiments. Fluxes were most strongly correlated with soil nitrate (NO3-). The soil NO3-concentration was the dominant variable contributing to the spatial variability of N2O fluxes, accounted for 60% the variability observed because soil water and C were close to the optimum condition for denitrification. The average minichamber fluxes were compared with fluxes measured by automatic chambers installed at the site as well as by micrometeorological techniques. Average fluxes from the mini chambers compared well with those of the large auto \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/galballyie_x2005c.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vxqUaif8PPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
