The algorithm uses monthly values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI) derived from the MODIS nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function \u2013 adjusted reflectance product (MOD43B4) to scale Priestley-Taylor potential evapotranspiration derived from the climate surfaces. The EVI is associated with evapotranspiration through its relationship with leaf area index. The GVMI allows separation between surface water and bare soil when EVI is low and provides information on vegetation water content when EVI is high. The model was calibrated using observed AET data from seven sites in Australia, including two forests, two open savannas, a grassland, a floodplain and a lake.
