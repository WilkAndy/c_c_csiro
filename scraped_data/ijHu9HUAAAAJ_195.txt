Over tall canopies many sites report (H+ \u03bb E)/(Rn-G)\u2248 0.7 whereas 100% closure is commonly achieved over short canopies. This observed failure of closure can be redressed to a large extent by proper consideration of averaging and coordinate rotation periods. At the majority of sites, coordinates are aligned by rotating post-facto into a frame that sets the mean vertical velocity/line {w}= 0 over the averaging period T. The covariance of a scalar c then reduces to the eddy covariance:/line {wc}=/line {w}~/line {c}+/line {w'c'}=/line {w'c'}. At other sites, coordinates are aligned with the long term wind field or other criteria and then/line {w}!= q 0 over the period T. At these sites the vertical mean advective component of the covariance,/line {w}~/line {c} is often ignored because it is noisy and may exceed/line {w'c' \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUFM.B51A0182F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
