This model is a modified version of gsc=a1A hs/cs first proposed by Ball, Woodrow & Berry (1987, in Progress in Photosynthesis Research, Martinus Mijhoff, Publ., pp. 221\u2013224), in which hs is relative humidity. Inclusion of the CO2 compensation point, \u03c4, improved the behaviour of the model at low values of cs, while a hyperbolic function of Ds for humidity response correctly accounted for the observed hyperbolic and linear variation of gsc and ci/cs as a function of Ds, where Ci is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1709, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11214464660700134064", "cites_id": ["11214464660700134064"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00370.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sPozLzHIoZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 7, "1996": 21, "1997": 25, "1998": 38, "1999": 37, "2000": 38, "2001": 43, "2002": 51, "2003": 39, "2004": 70, "2005": 50, "2006": 63, "2007": 52, "2008": 61, "2009": 62, "2010": 60, "2011": 72, "2012": 78, "2013": 76, "2014": 64, "2015": 65, "2016": 97, "2017": 79, "2018": 79, "2019": 89, "2020": 78, "2021": 71, "2022": 96, "2023": 32}}
