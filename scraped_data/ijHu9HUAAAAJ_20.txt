Trace gas fluxes measured with an open\u2010path analyser require the concurrent measurement of sensible and latent heat fluxes to correct for density fluctuations in trace gas concentration caused by these fluxes. A closed\u2010path analyser eliminates the corrections due to sensible heat flux, but not for water vapour, provided temperature fluctuations are completely removed without significantly reducing fluctuations in the trace gas mixing ratio. Theory for the design of heat exchangers and for the attenuation of concentration fluctuations during air flow through tubes is used to provide design criteria for closed\u2010path systems. Spectral transfer functions are used to estimate flux losses caused by flow through the sampling tube and gas analyser. Other factors considered include cross\u2010sensitivity of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 272, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5953892322636022984", "cites_id": ["5953892322636022984"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.1996.tb00076.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yESluYV5oFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 7, "1998": 10, "1999": 7, "2000": 14, "2001": 13, "2002": 11, "2003": 18, "2004": 20, "2005": 15, "2006": 12, "2007": 17, "2008": 14, "2009": 5, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 20, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
