The validity of transpiration rates measured by ventilated chambers (VCs) was assessed using two techniques which could be applied both with and without the VC in place. The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, applied to single leaves of the Eucalyptus species, provided one set of transpiration estimates for both VC positions. A second set was obtained using a leaf energy budget method which utilized paired leaves, one of which was prevented from transpiring, while the other behaved normally. Temperature differences between the two leaves and boundary layer conductances measured in situ were used to estimate transpiration rates for normal leaves through solution of leaf energy budget equations. Transpiration rates within the VC were reduced by up to 30% around midday relative to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6978863257572792584&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
