Considerable consistency is found in the value of those whole-canopy features of most importance to this interaction, namely solarreflection coefficient, through-canopy radiation absorption, aerodynamic roughness, the symptoms of near-surface K-theory failure, the canopy store for rainfall interception and the magnitude and environmental response of their bulk stomatal (surface) resistance. Typical values of these parameters and functions are given with a view to their potential use in climate simulation models. Attention is drawn to the fact that this similar micrometeorological response can generate different timeaverage surface-energy partitions when interacting with different climates and, in particular, alters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/W-Shuttleworth/publication/247605209_Micrometeorology_of_Temperate_and_Tropical_Forest_Discussion/links/0c9605351a48d8e4be000000/Micrometeorology-of-Temperate-and-Tropical-Forest-Discussion.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RXTUg4sxX4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
