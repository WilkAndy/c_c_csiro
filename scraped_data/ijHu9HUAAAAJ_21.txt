Typically, measurements are made in a finite sampling volume rather than at a single point, and the maximum frequency response of the sensors is less than the highest frequencies of the turbulent eddies responsible for the heat and mass transport. Both of these cause a loss of the high-frequency component of the covariances used to calculate fluxes. Errors also arise in calculating fluxes of trace gas quantities using open-path analyzers because of spurious density fluctuations arising from the fluxes of heat and water vapor. This chapter gives the reader an overview of how these sources of error can be eliminated or reduced using some model assumptions and additional measurements.
