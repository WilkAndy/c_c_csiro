This method showed negligible \ufb02uxes of CO2, consistent with the bareness of the experimental site, whereas the eddy covariance measurements indicated large downward \ufb02uxes of CO2. These apparently con\ufb02icting observations are in quantitative agreement with the results of a recent theory which predicts that whenever there are vertical \ufb02uxes of sensible or latent heat, a mean vertical velocity is developed. This velocity causes a mean vertical convective mass \ufb02ux (= p_cW for CO2, in standard l10talZl\ufb02). The eddy covariance technique neglects this mean convective \ufb02ux and measures only the turbulent \ufb02ux p [. w\u2019; Thus, when the net \ufb02ux of CO2 is zero, the eddy Qvariance method \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14945265379657386422&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tgls7K0_aM8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
