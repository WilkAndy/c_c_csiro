The original theory for one-dimensional flow over homogeneous terrain is extended to three-dimensional flow over inhomogeneous terrain. Thc cuations are rel-atively simple when concentrations are expressed as mixing ratios per unit of dry air. Advective mass fluxes are written as products of fluxos of dry air and gradients in mixing ratio, while turbulent eddy fluxes requires the covariance of wind speeds and mixing ratios. Theory developed by WPL for one dimensional flows is applicable for the vertical eddy flux."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/leuning_x2004a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xsUMRFXYK4kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
