Their sources can be anthropogenic such as industry and traffic or biogenic such as oceans, deserts, and vegetation. Aerosol particles can cool the climate directly by reflecting sunlight back to space and indirectly by forming cloud droplets. The contribution of biogenic aerosols to cooling the climate is still unclear\u2013largely because the amount of particles produced in forests is unknown. Forests have an important role as sources of new particles because they produce BVOCs (Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds) such as mono-and sesquiterpenes that undergo rapid reactions with atmospheric oxidants. The oxidation products have low volatility and readily take part in aerosol formation by condensing on small, pre-existing inorganic nuclei and possibly even by nucleating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/sunitm_x2006b.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x-UP2DinDN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
