Emphasis is on basic and applied scientific research relevant to practical problems in agriculture, forestry, and natural ecosystems. Articles must appeal to an international audience. The oretical models should be tested against experimental data. Special issues devoted to single topics are also published. Typical topics include canopy micrometeorology (eg, the characterization of radiative transfer, turbulence, evapotranspiration, and the exchange of trace gases and energy within and above managed and natural ecosystems), aerobiology (eg, the dispersion of pollen, pathogens, insects, and pesticides), biometeorology (eg, the effect of weather and climate on plant distribution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12452572741210860449&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
