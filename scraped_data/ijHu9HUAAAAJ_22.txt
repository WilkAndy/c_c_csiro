Eddy covariance was employed to measure fluxes of heat, water vapor and CO2. The flux-gradient method was used to determine CH4 fluxes from measured profiles of CH4 concentrations, with the required eddy diffusivity estimated using a modified aerodynamic approach or CO2 as a reference scalar. When the paddy was drained, net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere during daytime was 23% less, and nighttime CO2 emissions were almost twice as great, than when the paddy was flooded. The mean daily CO2 uptake on the drained days was 14.5gm\u22122, <50% of the mean for the flooded days. These differences in the CO2 budget were mainly due to increased CO2 emissions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 266, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9865097161782167810", "cites_id": ["9865097161782167810"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192300000927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Aom94pnd54gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 8, "2003": 8, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 8, "2007": 10, "2008": 6, "2009": 12, "2010": 15, "2011": 9, "2012": 12, "2013": 21, "2014": 13, "2015": 15, "2016": 20, "2017": 14, "2018": 19, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
