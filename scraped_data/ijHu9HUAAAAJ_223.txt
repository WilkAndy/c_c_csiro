This failure to close the energy balance is less common close to the surface over short roughness but is still sometimes seen, especially in complex topography. These observations cast doubt on the results obtained from long term flux studies where daily and annual net ecosystem exchange is usually the small difference between large positive and negative fluxes over 24 hours. In this paper we investigate this problem by examining some fundamental assumptions entailed in analysis of surface exchange by the eddy flux method.In particular, we clarify the form and use of the scalar conservation equation that underlies this analysis and we examine the links between averaging period and rotation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7469121430254194888&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yBCPIl6mp2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
