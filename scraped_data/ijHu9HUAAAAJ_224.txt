These methods include: 1) a Eulerian second-order closure model (EUL), 2) a localized near-field Lagrangian dispersion model (LNF), and 3) a hybrid model (HEL) which uses the Eulerian second-order turbulence model to calculate the flow statistics combined with the regression analysis used with the Lagrangian model. Model predictions were compared to measured heat CO2 and water vapor fluxes profiles measured in the canopy. In this study information content analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assess model sensitivities to measurement uncertainties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2664316009287234028&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LHzVkuN-SQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
