Whether the hydraulic and biochemical properties of plants evolve independently or whether they are linked at a time scale relevant to plant stand development remains uncertain. To address this question, a steady\u2010state analytical model was developed in which supply of CO2 via the stomata and biochemical demand for CO2 are constrained by the balance between loss of water vapour from the leaf to the atmosphere and supply of water from the soil to the leaf. The model predicts the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) for which the maximum demand for CO2 is in equilibrium with the maximum hydraulically permissible supply of water through the soil\u2013root \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 255, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7001625903303863595", "cites_id": ["7001625903303863595"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.00965.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K62ZsKnFKmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 11, "2005": 11, "2006": 21, "2007": 12, "2008": 23, "2009": 19, "2010": 14, "2011": 19, "2012": 16, "2013": 7, "2014": 15, "2015": 14, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
