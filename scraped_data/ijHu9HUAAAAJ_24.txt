The approach is applied to the Community Atmosphere\u2010Biosphere\u2010Land Exchange (CABLE). We compare modeled and observed fluxes of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), latent heat (LE) and sensible heat (H) at two different forested flux station sites. Using wavelet analysis, we identify the frequencies where model errors are relatively large, and then analyze the sensitivities of model errors at those frequencies to selected model parameters, yielding significant improvements in several measures of model performance. At Harvard Forest, the predictions by CABLE using the modified parameter values reduce model errors at daily to yearly timescales for all three fluxes, but not at interannual timescales for NEE. At the Tumbarumba site, predictions by CABLE with modified parameter values reduce the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 230, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=283429976410977049", "cites_id": ["283429976410977049"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010JG001385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GXOs1g_y7gMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 11, "2013": 28, "2014": 26, "2015": 26, "2016": 35, "2017": 12, "2018": 24, "2019": 14, "2020": 14, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
