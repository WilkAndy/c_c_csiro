Sampler performance was predicted theoretically and tested in a wind tunnel, the laboratory and in the field. The results showed that air flowed through the sampler at a rate linearly proportional to the external wind speed and that the ammonia it contained was absorbed quantitatively by the sampler. The mass of ammonia, M, collected by the instrument during a sampling period, t, is thus proportional to the mean convective flux density of ammonia, (u\u03f1 N ) since M = ( u\u03f1 N )t , where u is the wind velocity, \u03f1N the ammonia density, A is the effective cross-sectional area of the sampler, and the overbar represents a time-mean."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 212, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=684414059541535218", "cites_id": ["684414059541535218"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698185901969", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8plBAvaGfwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 6, "2000": 5, "2001": 6, "2002": 10, "2003": 9, "2004": 10, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 12, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 3}}
