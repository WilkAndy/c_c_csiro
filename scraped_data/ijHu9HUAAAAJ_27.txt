The scale\u2010dependence of a typical surface\u2010exchange model (the CSIRO Biospheric Model, CBM) is examined using the diurnal variation of hourly fluxes of CO2, latent heat, sensible heat and soil heat. The fluxes were measured using micrometeorological techniques over six sites in a grazing/pasture system in SE Australia during a period of three weeks in 1995. Nonlinear parameter inversion was used to determine model parameters.Analysis of the covariance of the estimates of the parameters and the unexplained residuals of the model showed that a maximum of three or four parameters could be determined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16362450707074572885", "cites_id": ["16362450707074572885"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2001.00434.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VeIE4jkaE-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 11, "2007": 13, "2008": 17, "2009": 18, "2010": 11, "2011": 14, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 12, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
