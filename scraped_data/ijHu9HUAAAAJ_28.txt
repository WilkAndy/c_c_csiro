Under these conditions, net transport between the surface and atmosphere is one-dimensional and the vertical flux density can be calculated by the covariance between turbulent fluctuations of the vertical wind and the quantity of interest."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 190, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=902794617667806261", "cites_id": ["902794617667806261"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2351-1_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NWQ56-tehwwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 9, "2014": 18, "2015": 14, "2016": 17, "2017": 17, "2018": 22, "2019": 19, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 23, "2023": 12}}
