However, directly observed relationships between climate and terrestrial CO 2 exchange with the atmosphere across biomes and continents are lacking. Here we present data describing the relationships between net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) and climate factors as measured using the eddy covariance method at 125 unique sites in various ecosystems over six continents with a total of 559 site-years. We find that NEE observed at eddy covariance sites is (1) a strong function of mean annual temperature at mid-and high-latitudes,(2) a strong function of dryness at mid-and low-latitudes, and (3) a function of both temperature and dryness around the mid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13514213631335051021", "cites_id": ["13514213631335051021"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/3/034007/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Da93QrIhjLsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 20, "2014": 25, "2015": 20, "2016": 14, "2017": 18, "2018": 16, "2019": 9, "2020": 17, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
