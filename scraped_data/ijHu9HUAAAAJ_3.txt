The first was the aerodynamic resistance\u2013surface energy balance model, and the second was the Penman\u2013Monteith (P\u2013M) equation, where the required surface conductance is estimated from remotely-sensed leaf area index. The models were tested using 3 years of evaporation and meteorological measurements from two contrasting Australian ecosystems, a cool temperate, evergreen Eucalyptus forest and a wet/dry, tropical savanna. The aerodynamic resistance\u2013surface energy balance approach failed because small errors in the radiative surface temperature translate into large errors in sensible heat, and hence into estimates of evaporation. The P\u2013M model adequately estimated the magnitude and seasonal variation in evaporation in both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 860, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7099907936393579221", "cites_id": ["7099907936393579221"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425706002677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1Uq3tqbwh2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 24, "2009": 41, "2010": 39, "2011": 51, "2012": 49, "2013": 70, "2014": 58, "2015": 62, "2016": 51, "2017": 63, "2018": 74, "2019": 64, "2020": 62, "2021": 66, "2022": 55, "2023": 15}}
