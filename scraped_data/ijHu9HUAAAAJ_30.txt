The parameters examined were the maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate () the potential photosynthetic electron transport rate (jmax,\u200325) of the leaf at the top of the canopy, and basal soil respiration (rs,\u200325), all at a reference temperature of 25\u00b0C. Eddy covariance measurements used in the analysis were from four evergreen forests, three deciduous forests and an oak\u2010grass savanna. Optimal estimates of model parameters were obtained by minimizing the weighted differences between the observed and predicted flux densities of latent heat, sensible heat and net ecosystem CO2 exchange for each year. Values of maximum carboxylation rates obtained from the flux measurements were in good \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=57453303986994912", "cites_id": ["57453303986994912"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2006.01225.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4D5Rv3kdzAAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 12, "2009": 18, "2010": 13, "2011": 21, "2012": 17, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
