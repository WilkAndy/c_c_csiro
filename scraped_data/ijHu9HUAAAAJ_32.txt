An Arrehenius equation, modified to account for decreases in each parameter at high temperatures, satisfactorily described the temperature response for both parameters. There was remarkable conformity in Vcmax and Jmax between all plants at Tleaf\u2003<\u200325\u2003\u00b0C, when each parameter was normalized by their respective values at 25\u2003\u00b0C (Vcmax0 and Jmax0), but showed a high degree of variability between and within species at Tleaf\u2003>\u200330\u2003\u00b0C. For both normalized Vcmax and Jmax, the maximum fractional error introduced by assuming a common temperature response function is <\u200a\u00b1\u20030\u00b71 for most plants and <\u200a\u00b1\u20030\u00b722 for all plants when Tleaf\u2003<\u200325\u2003\u00b0C. Fractional errors are typically <\u200a\u00b1\u20030\u00b745 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7953910138058786719", "cites_id": ["7953910138058786719"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2002.00898.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n0dfAiH3YW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 10, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 11, "2009": 14, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
