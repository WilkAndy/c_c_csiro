Measurements were made at various leaf temperatures, but the temperature dependence of Jmax and Vcmax differ. Once values for Jmax and Vcmax in Wullschleger's analysis were adjusted to a common temperature, using an equation for the temperature dependence of these parameters, the slope of the linear regression for Jmax versus Vcmax forced through the origin increased from 1.97 to 2.68, and r2 increased from 0.79 to 0.87."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 177, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8832036103845147675", "cites_id": ["8832036103845147675"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/48/2/345/652862", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G3Qd1QqykXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 6, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 9, "2004": 10, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 15, "2008": 6, "2009": 12, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 16, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
