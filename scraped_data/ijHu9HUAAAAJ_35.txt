Covariances between vertical windspeed and CO2 density from the closed-path analyser were calculated using data points for CO2 that were delayed relative to anemometer data by the time required for a parcel of air to travel from the tube inlet to the CO2 sensor. Air flow in the intake tube was laminar. Densities of CO2 that had been corrected for spurious fluctuations arising from fluctuations in temperature and humidity were used in the flux calculations. Corrections for the cross-sensitivity of CO2 analysers to water vapour were also incorporated. Spectral analysis of the corrected CO2 signal from the closed-path analyser showed that damping of fluctuations in the sampling tube at frequencies f > 0.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1481614110701569558", "cites_id": ["1481614110701569558"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00119818", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FsaSCi_AjxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 10, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 7, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 10, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
