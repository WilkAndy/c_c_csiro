Data are presented to support an empirical relationship linking stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, relative humidity and ambient CO2 concentration. The model was applied to stands of Pinus radiata subject to extremes of water and nutrient availability. Simulated water storage in the root zone agreed with measurements conducted over a 5 year period. Simulated and measured seasonal patterns of water use reached maximum rates of approximately 7 mm day\u22121 in summer for irrigated stands with projected leaf area indices of approximately 8. Simulated annual net photosynthesis (net of photorespiration and day-time foliar respiration) ranged from approximately 17 Mg C ha\u22121 year\u22121 for control stands to approximately 45 Mg C ha\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2732596374161780955", "cites_id": ["2732596374161780955"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112792905054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2_BupOwh7CUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 4, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 10, "1997": 9, "1998": 17, "1999": 12, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 13, "2008": 11, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
