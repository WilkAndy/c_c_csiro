We used remotely sensed leaf area indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) mounted on the polar\u2010orbiting Terra satellite with the Penman\u2010Monteith equation, gridded meteorology, and a two\u2010parameter biophysical model for surface conductance (Gs) to estimate 8\u2010day average evaporation at 1\u2010km resolution. Parameters for the Gs model were optimized using steady state water balance estimates (precipitation minus runoff) in the gauged catchments in three precipitation zones of the MDB, and the calibrated evaporation model was then used to estimate evaporation (ERS) and runoff from gauged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2361650349094792192", "cites_id": ["2361650349094792192"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007wr006563", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AOx43XpExiAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 11, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 14, "2017": 16, "2018": 19, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 2}}
