This conductance is a function of evaporation from the soil surface, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit, and maximum stomatal conductance (gsx). The novelty of this paper is the use of a \u201cBudyko\u2010curve\u201d hydrometeorological model to estimate mean annual evaporation rates and hence a unique value of gsx for each grid cell across the Australian continent. First, the hydrometeorological model was calibrated using long\u2010term water balances from 285 gauged catchments. Second, gridded meteorological data were used with the calibrated hydrometeorological model to estimate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5958673361891646171", "cites_id": ["5958673361891646171"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009WR008716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:21oiLNp1sVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 9, "2020": 15, "2021": 20, "2022": 22, "2023": 11}}
