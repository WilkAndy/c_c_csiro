CBL techniques treat the well mixed layer of air between heights of, say, 100 m and 1000 m as an integrator of surface fluxes along the path of a column of air moving over the landscape. They calculate the average surface flux from the scalar concentration in and above the mixed layer, and the CBL height. The flux estimates are averaged over regions of 10\u2013104 km2 extending 10 to 100 km upwind.An integral form of the CBL budget is used to estimate daily regional rates of CO2 uptake and evaporation from three data sets. There was plausible agreement between the estimates and locally measured fluxes. CBL budgets have great potential for estimating regional scalar fluxes, but there is an urgent need for validation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1243499344456069180", "cites_id": ["1243499344456069180"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.1996.tb00077.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PDC8wBDMQREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 11, "2000": 8, "2001": 6, "2002": 8, "2003": 7, "2004": 14, "2005": 10, "2006": 7, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
