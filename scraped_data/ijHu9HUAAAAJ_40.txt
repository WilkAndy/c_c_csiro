PFTs are used in global land-surface models to provide parameter values for every model grid cell. With a simple photosynthesis model we derive parameters for all site years within the Fluxnet eddy covariance data set. We compare the model parameters within and between PFTs and statistically group the sites. Fluxnet data is used to validate the photosynthesis model parameter variation within a PFT classification. Our major result is that model parameters appear more variable than assumed in PFTs. Simulated fluxes are of higher quality when model parameters of individual sites or site years are used. A simplification with less variation in model parameters results in poorer simulations. This indicates that a PFT classification introduces uncertainty in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13770159323596725515", "cites_id": ["13770159323596725515"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192310002273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cx2Eh_JuGb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 8, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 13, "2016": 14, "2017": 18, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
