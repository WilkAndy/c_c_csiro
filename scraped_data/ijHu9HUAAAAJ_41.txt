We show that there is a maximum in the sum of the turbulent flux and change in storage of CO2 in the early evening, Rmax, that is in close agreement with concurrent and independent estimates of net carbon exchange from soil and plant chambers.We hypothesize that the peak occurs because there is a time delay between the onset of radiative cooling and the development of temperature gradients that are strong enough to initiate thermally-driven horizontal and vertical flows that remove the stored CO2. We propose taking advantage of this time delay to develop relationships between Rmax and soil temperature and moisture.
