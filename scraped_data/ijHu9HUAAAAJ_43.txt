Leaves were sampled from known locations within canopies of selected trees and leaf N and P concentrations were measured. Contour maps of N and P distributions were then produced for crowns of trees aged between 6 and 16 months. Gas exchange measurements on sample leaves were used to estimate parameters of a model of C3 photosynthesis as a function of leaf N and P contentrations. Linear relationships were obtained between model parameters and leaf N concentration, but P appeared to be present in excess, since no correlation was found with P contentration. Photosynthetic light response curves were calculated for model leaves with differing N concentrations. The curves show that optimal concentrations of N in leaves depend on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15346141888627545329", "cites_id": ["15346141888627545329"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8RRjiL1y-NQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 12, "1996": 8, "1997": 10, "1998": 3, "1999": 9, "2000": 2, "2001": 8, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 7, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
