The aim was to assess optimal approaches in using optical remote sensing to estimate ET. The first two approaches directly regressed various MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and products such as leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) with ET and evaporative fraction (EF). In the third approach, the Penman\u2013Monteith (PM) equation was inverted to obtain surface conductance (Gs), for dry plant canopies. The Gs values were then regressed against the MODIS data products and used to parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of ET \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2974341695487079499", "cites_id": ["2974341695487079499"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712004270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S_QjaAP8RikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 17, "2016": 10, "2017": 15, "2018": 17, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
