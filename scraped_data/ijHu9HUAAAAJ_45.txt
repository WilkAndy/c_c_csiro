Inga) fields without affecting the plant's environment, are described and compared with an established micrometeorological method. Method A requires a circular plot of a 25\u2010m radius over which wind speed and atmospheric ammonia concentrations are observed at 0.8 m above the floodwater. Method B requires measurements of ammoniacal nitrogen concentration, pH and temperature in the floodwater, and wind speed at a fixed height. Method A is the more accurate technique and requires fewer measurements. It appears that one calibration curve relating vertical flux of ammonia to these measurements can be applied in widely different environments. Method B is not only less accurate than Method A but appears to require different calibration curves to determine vertical flux for different environments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15581332595787991952", "cites_id": ["15581332595787991952"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1985.03615995004900040051x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kIsoQ3EDPNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 3, "1987": 7, "1988": 7, "1989": 7, "1990": 6, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
