We developed a temporal upscaling scheme using satellite-derived instantaneous estimates of evapotranspiration to produce a daily-sum evapotranspiration averaged over an 8-day interval. We tested this scheme against measured evapotranspiration data from 34 eddy covariance flux towers covering seven plant functional types from boreal to tropical climatic zones. We found that the ratio of a half-hourly-sum of potential solar radiation (extraterrestrial solar irradiance on a plane parallel to the Earth's surface) between 10:00hh and 14:00hh to a daily-sum of potential solar radiation provides a robust scaling factor to convert a half-hourly measured evapotranspiration to an estimate of a daily-sum; the estimated and measured daily \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2907512375722588462", "cites_id": ["2907512375722588462"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311002863", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ljn_3hmPWSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 16, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
