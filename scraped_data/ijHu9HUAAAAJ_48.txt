Flux chambers are suitable for measuring small leakage rates from sources at known locations but many samples are required because of large spatial heterogeneity in the fluxes. Micrometeorological eddy covariance, relaxed eddy accumulation and flux-gradient techniques are suitable for measuring leakage from large area sources, while integrated horizontal mass balance, tracer methods and plume dispersion approaches are applicable for line and point sources. Distinguishing between leakage signals and natural fluctuations in CO2 concentrations due to biogenic sources pose significant challenges and the use of naturally occurring tracers such as CO2 isotopologues or introduced tracers such as SF6 added \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12900004556652804183", "cites_id": ["12900004556652804183"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583608000030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V_g1EMwFBrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 12, "2010": 5, "2011": 20, "2012": 13, "2013": 16, "2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
