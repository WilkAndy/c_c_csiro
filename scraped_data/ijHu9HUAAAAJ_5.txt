Fluxes and conductances were calculated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves. A linear dependence of photosynthetic capacity on leaf nitrogen content was assumed, while leaf nitrogen content and light intensity were assumed to decrease exponentially within canopies. Separate extinction coefficients were used for diffuse and direct beam radiation. An efficient Gaussian integration technique was used to compute fluxes and mean conductances for the canopy. The multilayer model synthesizes current knowledge of radiation penetration, leaf physiology and the physics of evaporation and provides insights into the response of whole canopies to multiple, interacting factors. The model was also used to explore \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 741, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15626779617770602833", "cites_id": ["15626779617770602833"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00628.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UQGIpER53dgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 5, "1997": 13, "1998": 21, "1999": 20, "2000": 22, "2001": 33, "2002": 35, "2003": 28, "2004": 34, "2005": 30, "2006": 28, "2007": 38, "2008": 32, "2009": 21, "2010": 24, "2011": 35, "2012": 30, "2013": 22, "2014": 23, "2015": 23, "2016": 38, "2017": 27, "2018": 27, "2019": 31, "2020": 32, "2021": 33, "2022": 19, "2023": 11}}
