To characterise the influence of post-photosynthetic processes, we investigated the effect of starch storage and remobilisation on the stable carbon isotope signature (\u03b413C) of different carbon pools in the Eucalyptus delegatensis R. T. Baker leaf and the potential carbon isotope fractionation associated with phloem transport and respiration. Twig phloem exudate and leaf water-soluble OM showed diel variations in \u03b413C of up to 2.5 and 2\u2030, respectively, with 13C enrichment during the night and depletion during the day. Damped diel variation was also evident in bulk lipids of the leaf and in the leaf wax fraction. \u03b413C of nocturnal phloem exudate OM corresponded with the \u03b413C of carbon released from starch. There was no change in \u03b413C of phloem carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10298648383674024239", "cites_id": ["10298648383674024239"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp07064", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L4GK7yMm7I4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 18, "2010": 21, "2011": 16, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
