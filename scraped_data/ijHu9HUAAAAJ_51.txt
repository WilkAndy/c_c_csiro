During that period green area index ranged from 1.8 to 4.5 for the fertilised crop and from 1.0 to 2.7 for the control crop. Excellent agreement was obtained between simulations and measurements for fluxes of net radiation, latent heat and CO2, although sensible heat fluxes were less satisfactory. Uncertainties in estimates for fluxes of water vapour and CO2 from the underlying soil contributed to discrepancies between measurements and simulations. Modelled canopy fluxes of both CO2 and latent heat are highly sensitive to the quantum yield of photosynthesis (\u03bcmol CO2mol\u22121 quanta). Fluxes of latent heat are more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3149344711875096810", "cites_id": ["3149344711875096810"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192398000744", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6vCRWlS4tCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 7, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 8, "2005": 10, "2006": 7, "2007": 11, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
