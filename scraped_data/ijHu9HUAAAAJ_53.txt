This method showed negligible fluxes of CO2, consistent with the bareness of the experimental site, whereas the eddy covariance measurements indicated large downward fluxes of CO2. These apparently conflicting observations are in quantitative agreement with the results of a recent theory which predicts that whenever there are vertical fluxes of sensible or latent heat, a mean vertical velocity is developed. This velocity causes a mean vertical convective mass flux (= \u03c1 cw for CO2, in standard notation). The eddy covariance technique neglects this mean convective flux and measures only the turbulent flux \u03c1\u2032 c w\u2032. Thus, when the net flux of CO2 is zero, the eddy covariance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7059744608491620584", "cites_id": ["7059744608491620584"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00123298", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6EgfOlFA-WEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 5, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
