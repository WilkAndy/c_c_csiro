Here, we focus on the interplay between radiative transfer, flow dynamics for neutral stratification, and ecophysiological controls on CO2 sources and sinks within a canopy on a gentle cosine hill. We examine how topography alters the forest-atmosphere CO2 exchange rate when compared to uniform flat terrain using a newly developed first-order closure model that explicitly accounts for the flow dynamics, radiative transfer, and nonlinear eco physiological processes within a plant canopy. We show that variation in radiation and airflow due to topography causes only a minor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2667166420648740006", "cites_id": ["2667166420648740006"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-005-6436-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pkSec7qtAyUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 9, "2008": 20, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 9, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
