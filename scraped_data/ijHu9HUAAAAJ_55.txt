Seedlings were planted in a pasture either directly into grassy groundcover or in circular patches of bare soil of 30, 60 or 120 cm in diameter. There were no differences in maximum air temperatures at seedling leaf height between treatments. However, minimum air temperature increased by 2 \u00b0C with increase in patch diameter from 0 to 120 cm such that seedlings surrounded by grass experienced lower minimum temperatures with more frequent and more severe frosts than seedlings growing in large patches of bare soil. These small\u2010scale differences in minimum temperature affected both photosynthetic and growth processes. Over winter, seedlings were photoinhibited, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16795009779874078378", "cites_id": ["16795009779874078378"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-61.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qh6bOGncE-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 7, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
