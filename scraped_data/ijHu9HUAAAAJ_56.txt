It employs a square plot, 24m\u00d724m, with measurements of gas concentration at four heights (up to 3.5m) along each of the four boundaries. Gas concentrations are multiplied by the appropriate vector winds to yield the horizontal fluxes at each height on each boundary. The difference between these fluxes integrated over downwind and upwind boundaries represents production. Illustrations of the method, which involve exchanges of methane and carbon dioxide, are drawn from experiments with landfills, pastures and grazing animals. Tests included calculation of recovery rates from known gas releases and comparisons with a conventional micrometeorological approach and a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12103194737580050557", "cites_id": ["12103194737580050557"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231098000910", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fQjWBH0v96cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 7, "2005": 11, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
