During the first 11 days after urea application, about 46% of the applied N was lost from the water-soil-plant system. Only 11% was volatilized as ammonia, despite very high floodwater pH values (up to pH 10) and some strong winds. Gaseous loss as nitrous oxide and leaching of N beyond a soil depth of 100 mm were both negligible. All the evidence indicates that the other 35% of the applied N was lost as dinitrogen produced by denitrification of nitrite and nitrate after nitrification of ammonium near the soil surface. No further losses from the system were detected after the first 11 days. Final recovery of the fertilizer N by the above-ground crop was only 17 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6169633502744063476", "cites_id": ["6169633502744063476"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9840189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9K1ojfvwnlUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 5, "1987": 9, "1988": 7, "1989": 8, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
