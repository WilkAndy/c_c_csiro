The FTIR measurements were fully automated and routinely obtained a precision of 0.1\u20130.2% for several weeks during a measurement campaign in October 1995. In flux-gradient measurements, vertical profiles of the trace gases were measured every 30min from the ground to 22m. When combined with independent micrometeorological measurements of water vapour fluxes, trace gas fluxes from the underlying surface could be determined. In the nocturnal boundary layer method the rate of change in mass storage in the 0\u201322m layer was combined with fluxes measured at 22m to estimate surface fluxes.
