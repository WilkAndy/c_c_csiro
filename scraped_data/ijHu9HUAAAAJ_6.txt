This failureto close the energy balance is less common close to the surface over short roughnessbut is still sometimes seen, especially in complex topography. These observationscast doubt on the results obtained from long term flux studies where daily and annualnet ecosystem exchange is usually the small difference between large positive andnegative fluxes over 24 h. In this paper we investigate this problem by examiningsome fundamental assumptions entailed in analysis of surface exchange by the eddyflux method.In particular, we clarify the form and use of the scalar conservation equation thatunderlies this analysis and we examine the links between averaging period androtation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 718, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6164613232318051629", "cites_id": ["6164613232318051629"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021554900225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LXX9wRIbjVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 10, "2004": 32, "2005": 37, "2006": 35, "2007": 38, "2008": 67, "2009": 38, "2010": 34, "2011": 34, "2012": 55, "2013": 45, "2014": 33, "2015": 30, "2016": 30, "2017": 41, "2018": 33, "2019": 34, "2020": 34, "2021": 22, "2022": 16, "2023": 12}}
