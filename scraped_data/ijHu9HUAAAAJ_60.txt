Effects of leaf size, height above ground and the type of underlying surface on leaf temperatures of Eucalyptus pauciflora and E. viminalis seedlings during nights of radiation frost were investigated.Temperatures of leaves exposed to clear skies after sunset were 1\u20133\u00b0C lower than those of the adjacent air at all heights except ground level. Intensity and duration of sub-freezing temperatures of leaves diminished with increasing height above ground. Temperatures at the centre of larger E. pauciflora leaves were 0.5\u20131.5\u00b0C lower than for smaller E. viminalis leaves, but tip temperatures of the former were similar to those at the centre of E. viminalis. Leaf temperatures of E. pauciflora were \u223c 0.5\u20131.5\u00b0C lower when held horizontally compared to vertical leaves at the same height.
