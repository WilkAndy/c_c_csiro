The modelled change in biomass heat storage (Jtr) is driven by radial heat diffusion within the trunks and surface heat exchange by convection, insolation and longwave radiation. The calculation requires only variables from the previous and current time step and is independent of measured biomass temperature. The model was applied to a 40m tall Australian temperate Eucalyptus forest at the Tumbarumba Ozflux site. A comparison between modelled and measured trunk temperatures showed agreement to within 1\u00b0C, providing confidence in the model. Hourly values of Jtr peaked at 61Wm\u22122 for this site. Similar values of Jtr were obtained using an adaptation of the force-restore method.
