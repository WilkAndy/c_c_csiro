The study was performed at Wagga Wagga on a gradational clay soil between 1993 and 1998, during which there was both drought and high amounts of drainage (>10% of annual rainfall) from the rotation. Lucerne removed an additional 125 mm from soil water storage compared with wheat (root-zone of ~1 m), leading to an estimated reduction in drainage to 30\u201350% of that of rotations comprising solely annual crops and/or pasture. This additional soil water uptake by lucerne was achieved through apparent root extension of 2\u20132.5 m beyond that of annual crops. It was effective in generating a sink for soil water retention that was about double that of annual crops in this soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1926253730177508912", "cites_id": ["1926253730177508912"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar00089", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MGaA1o9tuxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 10, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
