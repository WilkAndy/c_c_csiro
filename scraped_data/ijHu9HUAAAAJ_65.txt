Measurements were made during IREX96, an international rice experiment in Okayama, Japan. Results for the cumulative fluxes of heat, water vapour and CH4 at the canopy top were satisfactory once their respective concentration profiles were smoothed using simple analytic functions. According to the inverse analysis, water vapour was emitted relatively uniformly by each of five equi-spaced layers within the canopy, whereas sensible heat fluxes were small (<100Wm\u22122) and of either sign. Methane fluxes were predicted to be emitted most strongly in the lower 50% of the canopy, as expected from the distribution of micropores along leaves and leaf sheaths, the major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9254261022278796958", "cites_id": ["9254261022278796958"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192300001581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nsarW169bYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 10, "2003": 8, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
