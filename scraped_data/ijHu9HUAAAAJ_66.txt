The former measured the mean emission, over 45min intervals, from all the sheep within a fenced 24m\u00d724m enclosure, from the enrichment of methane (CH4) in air as it passed over the sheep. The tracer technique measured emissions from a subset of 7 individual animals over 24h periods from measurements of CH4 and SF6 concentrations in air exhaled by the sheep, and from the known rate of release of SF6 from small permeation tubes placed in the animals\u2019 rumens. Both methods gave highly similar results for 4 out of 5 days. When the species composition of dietary intake was steady during the last two days of measurement, the mean emission rate from the mass-balance method was 11.9\u00b11.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6335079572231444951", "cites_id": ["6335079572231444951"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231098003653", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:11mwZk656lcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 8, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 9, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
