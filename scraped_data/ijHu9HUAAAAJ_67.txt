Monin\u2013Obukhov similarity theorywas used to account for the effects of atmosphericstability on \u03c3w(z), the standard deviation ofvertical velocity and \u03c4L(z), the Lagrangian timescale of the turbulence. Classical surface layer scaling was applied in the inertial sublayer (z > zruf)using the similarity parameter \u03b6 = (z - d)/L, where z is height above ground, d is the zero plane displacementheight for momentum, L is the Obukhov length,and zruf \u2248 2.3hc, where hc iscanopy height. A single length scale hc, was usedfor the stability parameter 3 = hc/L in the height range 0.25 < z/hc < 2.5. This choice is justified by mixing layer theory, which shows that within the roughness sublayer there is one \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7345930743278347755", "cites_id": ["7345930743278347755"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1002449700617", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6yW6MRf98WUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
