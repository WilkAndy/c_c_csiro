Two satellite datasets indicate a positive trend (first time derivative) in global available energy from 1983 to 2006, suggesting that positive trends in evaporation may occur in \u201cwet\u201d regions where energy supply limits evaporation. However, decadal trends in evaporation estimated from water balances of 110 wet catchments                                                      do not match trends in evaporation estimated using three alternative methods: 1)                                                      , a model-tree ensemble approach that uses statistical relationships between             E             measured across the global network of flux stations, meteorological drivers, and remotely sensed fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; 2)                                                      , a Budyko-style \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11372527922524324887", "cites_id": ["11372527922524324887"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/13/1/jhm-d-11-012_1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FwRGLORV050J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
