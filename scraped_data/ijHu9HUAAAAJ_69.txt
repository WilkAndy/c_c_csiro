Associated with this has been widespread adoption of the eddy covariance method to provide direct estimates of mass and energy exchange between vegetation surfaces and the atmosphere. With the eddy covariance method, fast-response instruments (10\u201320Hz) are typically mounted above plant canopies and the fluxes are calculated by correlating turbulent fluctuations in vertical velocity with fluctuations in various scalars such as CO2, water vapour and temperature. These techniques allow the direct and non-destructive measurement of the net exchange of CO2 owing to uptake via photosynthesis and loss owing to respiration, evapotranspiration and sensible heat. Eddy covariance measurements have a high temporal resolution, with fluxes typically calculated at 30-min \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10196352617844728291", "cites_id": ["10196352617844728291"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/BT04147", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:42FC7664gI0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 13, "2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
