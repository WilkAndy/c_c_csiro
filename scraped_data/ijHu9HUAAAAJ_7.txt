Data were obtained from field measurements, restricted to periods with plentiful soil water, adequate light, high relative humidity and moderate temperature. The data encompass most major vegetation types and a wide range of leaf area index (\u0393). Observed Gsmax is not systematically dependent on \u0393; and takes average values of 20 and 33 mm s\u22121 for natural vegetation and agricultural crops. A similar pattern exists in the gsmax data, which yield remarkably consistent average values of 6 and 12 mm s\u22121, respectively, for natural vegetation and crops. Overall, the ratio G smax g smax  is consistently close to 3, for seven major vegetation types of diverse structure. A simple model accounts for the close \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 707, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8143588867218840891", "cites_id": ["8143588867218840891"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016819239402178M", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O51nm-3WA3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 19, "1997": 13, "1998": 29, "1999": 18, "2000": 17, "2001": 26, "2002": 19, "2003": 24, "2004": 33, "2005": 19, "2006": 20, "2007": 22, "2008": 43, "2009": 26, "2010": 22, "2011": 39, "2012": 24, "2013": 29, "2014": 30, "2015": 27, "2016": 32, "2017": 23, "2018": 30, "2019": 41, "2020": 24, "2021": 27, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
