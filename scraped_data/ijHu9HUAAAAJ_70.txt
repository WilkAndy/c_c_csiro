However the microclimate within a chamber differs from natural conditions, leading to possible bias in the measurements.The validity of transpiration rates measured by ventilated chambers was assessed using two techniques which could be applied both with and without the chamber in place. The Penman-Monteith equation, applied to single leaves, provided one set of transpiration estimates for both chamber positions. A second set was obtained using a leaf energy budget method which utilized paired leaves, one of which was prevented from transpiring, while the other behaved normally. Temperature differences between the two leaves and boundary layer conductances measured in situ were used to estimate transpiration rates for normal leaves through solution of leaf energy budget equations.Transpiration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16021914930985769292", "cites_id": ["16021914930985769292"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192390900425", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TBnv8r1GWd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 7, "1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 3, "1997": 8, "1998": 7, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2}}
