Two afternoon, \u2018snap-shot\u2019 experiments were conducted; one in the summer and one in the autumn of 2004, to examine the statistics and soil variables affecting the spatial variability of N2O emissions at paddock scale. Small, static chambers (mini-chambers) were placed at 100 locations over an 8,100 m2 area of irrigated dairy pasture in northern Victoria, Australia. Chamber headspace was sampled for N2O and soil samples taken below each mini-chamber were analysed for soil nitrate (NO3 -), ammonium (NH4 +) and other chemical and physical properties known to affect N2O emissions. The experiments took place \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9234147190589385455", "cites_id": ["9234147190589385455"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-008-9639-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:72rA-vFHJoAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 10, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
