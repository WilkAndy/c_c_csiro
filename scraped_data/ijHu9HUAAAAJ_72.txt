Three methods for improving the consideration of soil evaporation influence in total evapotranspiration estimates for these ecosystems are proposed. The original PML model considered evaporation as a constant fraction (f) of soil equilibrium evaporation. We propose an adaptation that considers f as a variable primarily related to soil water availability. In order to estimate daily f values, the first proposed method (fSWC) uses rescaled soil water content measurements, the second (fZhang) uses the ratio of 16 days antecedent precipitation and soil equilibrium evaporation, and the third (fdrying), includes a soil drying simulation factor for periods after a rainfall event. E estimates were validated using E \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14823990434416358052", "cites_id": ["14823990434416358052"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wrcr.20468", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pPIsXcJkuc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
