It is shown that if the condition  [Formula: see text]  is true, the conservation of mass can be applied with the assumption of no net ecosystem source or sink of dry air and the FQEC is reduced to the following equation and its approximation for horizontally homogeneous mass fluxes:Here w is vertical velocity, c molar density, t time, h eddy flux measurement height, z vertical distance and \u03c7s=cs/cd molar mixing ratio relative to dry air. Subscripts s, d and CO2 are for the specified constituent, dry air and carbon dioxide, respectively. Primes and overbars refer to turbulent fluctuations and time averages, respectively.
