This paper uses a well\u2010validated, process\u2010based model that estimates transpiration and soil evaporation, and for the first time investigates and quantifies how the main global drivers, associated to vegetation process and the water and energy cycle, drive the spatiotemporal variation of the two components. The results show that transpiration and soil evaporation dominate the variance of actual evapotranspiration in wet and dry regions, respectively. Dry southern hemisphere from 13\u00b0S to 27\u00b0S is highlighted since it contributes to 21% global soil evaporation variance, with only 11% global land area. In wet regions, particularly in the humid tropics, there are strong correlations between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11268832554334672323", "cites_id": ["11268832554334672323"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JD027025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w9V52oDvYpwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
