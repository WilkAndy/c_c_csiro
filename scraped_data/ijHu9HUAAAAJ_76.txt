A novel experimental design was used to measure all terms in the mass balance of CO2 in a 50m\u00d750m wide, 6m tall control volume (CV) located on the floor of a 40m tall Eucalyptus forest to examine the contributions of the eddy flux, the change in storage and the horizontal and vertical advection terms. Horizontal flux divergences between the four vertical walls of the CV were determined using perforated tubing arranged parallel to the ground to measure CO2 mixing ratios. The change in storage was calculated using CO2 concentration profiles measured in the centre of the CV. Vertical advection was calculated using these profiles, combined with vertical velocities, wc, calculated using the mass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5881881121625240033", "cites_id": ["5881881121625240033"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819230800186X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4XGMcbejoFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 13, "2011": 5, "2012": 11, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
