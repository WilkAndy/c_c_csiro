Data from a vertically-structured pristine forest ofNothofagusare presented as an example of the effects of biodiversity on the scaling of conductances between tiers of plant organisation. Available data sets of maximum leaf stomatal conductances(g  lmax ) and bulk vegetation surface conductances (G smax ) are compared. Overall, the ratio G smax /g  lmax  is consistently close to 3 for seven major vegetation types of diverse structure. An analytical model accounts for this close relationship, and in particular how G smax  is conservative against changes in leaf area index because of the compensating decrease in plant canopy transpiration and increase in soil evaporation as leaf area index \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9081349437214966122", "cites_id": ["9081349437214966122"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-0343-5_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:akFktjJvB34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
