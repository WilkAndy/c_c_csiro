However, the uncertainties of this sink are large, on the order of \u00b140%, with spatial and temporal variations largely unknown. One of the largest factors contributing to the uncertainty is photosynthesis, the process by which plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Currently, photosynthesis, or gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), can only be inferred from flux towers by measuring the exchange of CO2 in the surrounding air column. Consequently, carbon models suffer from a lack of spatial coverage of accurate GEP observations. Here, we show that photosynthetic light use efficiency (\u025b), hence photosynthesis, can be directly inferred from spaceborne measurements of reflectance. We demonstrate that the differential between reflectance measurements in bands associated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8806740233620852725", "cites_id": ["8806740233620852725"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011JG001692", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9Y8cFpXTN3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
