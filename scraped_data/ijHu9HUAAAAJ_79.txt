Consequently, experimental data on greenhouse gas production from European and North American agricultural soils and its interpretation are unlikely to be directly applicable to Australian systems. A programme of studies of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture has been established that is designed to reduce uncertainty of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions in the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and provide outputs that will enable better on-farm management practices for reducing non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, particularly nitrous oxide. The systems being examined and their locations are irrigated pasture (Kyabram Victoria), irrigated cotton (Narrabri, NSW), irrigated maize (Griffith, NSW), rain-fed wheat (Rutherglen, Victoria) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16367380560644091339", "cites_id": ["16367380560644091339"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15693430500395396", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yy3T3OadJOMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 1, "2010": 11, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
