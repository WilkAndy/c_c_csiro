Stomatal conductance in the model depends on light, temperature and intercellular CO2 concentration via photosynthesis and on leaf water potential, which in turn is a function of soil water potential, the rate of water flow through the soil and plant, and on xylem hydraulic resistance. Water transport from soil to roots is simulated through solution of Richards\u2019 equation. The model captures the observed hysteresis in diurnal variations in stomatal conductance, assimilation rate and transpiration for plant canopies. Hysteresis arises because atmospheric demand for water from the leaves typically peaks in mid\u2010afternoon and because of uneven distribution of soil matric potentials with distance from the roots. Potentials at the root surfaces are lower than in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 685, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8374904627614619292", "cites_id": ["8374904627614619292"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.01035.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nJa-_GKjOXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 25, "2007": 16, "2008": 30, "2009": 31, "2010": 24, "2011": 36, "2012": 31, "2013": 40, "2014": 43, "2015": 42, "2016": 53, "2017": 51, "2018": 60, "2019": 47, "2020": 36, "2021": 33, "2022": 44, "2023": 27}}
