Simulations were performed for trees aged 6, 9, 12 and 16 months which had been grown in plantations under a factorial combination of two levels of fertilization and irrigation. Observed leaf N distribution patterns yielded daily assimilation rates which were only marginally greater (<5%) than for hypothetical trees with uniform distributions. Patterns of assimilation distribution in individual tree crowns closely resembled those for absorbed radiation, rather than for N. These conclusions were unaffected by three choices of alternative leaf area density distributions. The simulation model was also used to calculate hourly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6677870708027290846", "cites_id": ["6677870708027290846"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317711", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3vTzLweQrFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 7, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
