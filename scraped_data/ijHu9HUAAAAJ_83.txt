A set of non-linear equations describes the interaction of leaf and ground temperatures through radiation exchange when shading of the ground by the leaf is important. Numerical techniques were used to obtain the solutions. A simple equation was also presented for T1 when shading is unimportant.Shading influenced ground surface temperature by up to 8\u00b0C for relatively poor thermal conductors, such as a grass sward, but by only \u223c 2\u00b0C for a better conductor such as mineral soil. In the absence of wind, changes in T1 as a result of shading were predicted to be + 1.5\u00b0C and + 1.0\u00b0C for leaves 0.10 and 0.01 m wide, respectively, when displayed above a grass sward.
