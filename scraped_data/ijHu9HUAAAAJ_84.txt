We find the technique is accurate (\u2329QbLS/Q\u232a=0.99,\u03c3=0.29) when strict meteorological filtering is applied to ensure that Monin\u2013Obukhov Similarity Theory is valid for the periods analysed and when downwind enrichments in tracer gas concentration are 1% or more above background concentration. Because of their respective baseline atmospheric concentrations, this enrichment criterion is less onerous for CH4 than for CO2. Therefore for geologically sequestered gas reservoirs with a significant CH4 component, monitoring CH4 as a surrogate for CO2 leakage could be as much as 10 times more sensitive than monitoring CO2 alone. Additional recommendations for designing a robust atmospheric monitoring strategy for geosequestration include: continuous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13967527445221224263", "cites_id": ["13967527445221224263"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231009001320", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ry_uUjWg1sEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
