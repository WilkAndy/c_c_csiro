Model parameterisation was constrained through multiple measurements, including daytime eddy flux measurements of CO2 and water vapour exchange, estimates of above- and below-ground biomass pools, growth rates measured through stem-diameter increments and measurement of specific ecosystem processes, such as litter fall and soil respiration rates. The resultant estimates of net ecosystem exchange ranged from an uptake of 4.0t Cha\u22121year\u22121 in a year with adequate rainfall to a loss of 0.4t Cha\u22121year\u22121 in a year affected by drought and insect damage. The simulations indicated that this reduction in carbon gain was primarily due to insect damage rather than a direct consequence of water shortage.
