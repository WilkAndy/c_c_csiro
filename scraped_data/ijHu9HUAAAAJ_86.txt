When PPD was applied with urea to the floodwater, urea hydrolysis was not prevented but merely delayed by \u223c4 d. Consequently, the accumulation of ammoniacal N in the floodwater was also delayed. The maximum ammoniacal N concentration was reached after 3 d in the urea control, and after 9 d in the urea + PPD treatment. The relative losses of ammonia (NH3) from the treatments thus depended on the temperatures and pH of the floodwater and the windspeeds prevailing during the respective periods when the concentration of ammoniacal N was high. Low windspeeds at 8 to 10\u2010d after application caused NH3 loss on the PPD\u2010treated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15935584752867783315", "cites_id": ["15935584752867783315"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1985.03615995004900060019x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k7LQAueRJt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 9, "1989": 7, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
