Variability in ecosystem characteristics alters biophysical and biogeochemical processes that can affect regional to global circulation patterns, which are not well characterized by land surface models. We initiated a multidisciplinary field campaign called Savanna Patterns of Energy and Carbon Integrated across the Landscape (SPECIAL) during the dry season in Australian savannas to understand the spatial patterns and processes of land surface\u2013atmosphere exchanges (radiation, heat, moisture, CO             2             , and other trace gasses). We utilized a combination of multiscale measurements including fixed flux towers, aircraft-based flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2579676346758402130", "cites_id": ["2579676346758402130"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/92/11/2011bams2948_1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UhADPPjZzCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
