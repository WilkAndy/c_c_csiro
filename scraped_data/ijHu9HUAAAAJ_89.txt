These estimates are based almost wholly on extrapolations of enclosure experiments to the field scale and uncertainty levels are high. Verification with direct field measurements is needed. This paper reports micrometeorological studies of N2O emissions from Australian grazed pastures made at the same location on a variety of space scales. They included a mass-balance study employing a small test plot approximately 0.05 ha in area in which 14 sheep were grazed, tower-based flux measurements representing areas between 25 ha and 5 km2 and convective boundary-layer budgets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10174752730804932623", "cites_id": ["10174752730804932623"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465997200000350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D1AQVbP7M40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
