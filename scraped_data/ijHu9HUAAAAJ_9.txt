The two-leaf model includes: (1) a simple but robust radiation model, (2) an improved leaf model accounting for the interaction of conductance and photosynthesis and the response of stomata to water vapour pressure deficit and available soil water and (3) a new parameterisation of radiative conductance which simplifies solution of the leaf energy balance equation. Comparisons with a multi-layered model show that predicted fluxes of CO2, latent and sensible heat fluxes usually agree within 5% over a range leaf area index typical of a wheat crop grown in a temperate climate. The two-leaf model is computationally 10 times more efficient than the multi-layered model and is suitable for the incorporation into regional and global climate models.
