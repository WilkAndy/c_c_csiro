In convective conditions the flow within the canopy is coupled through turbulent exchange to the flow aloft. As the transition proceeds, the within- and above-canopy flows decouple and vertically coherent waves form within the canopy. The intensity of above-canopy turbulence is not a good indicator of flow decoupling. Within-canopy waves can lead to large random error in the measurement of the change of storage and the advection terms in the mass balance equation. More importantly, errors associated with sampling over incomplete wave cycles will inevitably be combined with true advective flux divergences at non-ideal sites. Quantitative estimates of likely errors on storage of heat and CO2 within the canopy are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14065859216897569942", "cites_id": ["14065859216897569942"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311000785", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lnTVA2_4M8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
