The model utilizes an Eulerian higher-orderclosure approach that permits coupling of scalar andmomentum transport within vegetation to infer sourcesand sinks from mean scalar concentration profiles; theso-called `inverse problem'. To compute the requiredvelocity statistics, a Eulerian second-order closuremodel was considered. The model well reproducedmeasured first and second moment velocity statisticsinside the canopy. Using these modelled velocitystatistics, scalar fluxes within and above the canopywere computed and compared with CO2eddy-correlation measurements above the canopy. Goodagreement was obtained between model calculations offluxes at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17679267553644270104", "cites_id": ["17679267553644270104"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018730118183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GFIO2CtgWfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 7, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
