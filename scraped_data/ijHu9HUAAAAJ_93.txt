Ammonia volatilization was negligible, before and after flooding, when urea was applied to the dry soil surface two days before permanent flood. Before flooding, the urea prills remained undissolved and urea hydrolysis could not proceed. Thus there was no source of fertilizerderived ammonia for volatilization to occur. Upon flooding, the urea prills were washed into cracks in the soil which subsequently closed. Therefore the movement of soluble nitrogen into the floodwater was prevented, and again there was no ammonia source for the volatilization process.When urea was broadcast into the floodwater a few days after permanent flood, ammonia losses were high and varied from 11\u201321% of the nitrogen applied. These losses were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3023260930366597768", "cites_id": ["3023260930366597768"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01053314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iGrRWczH9CkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 9, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
