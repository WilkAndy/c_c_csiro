In many ecosystems, GPP is primary limited by absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation; in others by canopy conductance. These controls further vary in importance over daily to seasonal time scales. We propose a simple but effective conceptual model that estimates GPP as the lesser of a conductance-limited (Fc) and radiation-limited (Fr) assimilation rate. Fc is estimated from canopy conductance while Fr is estimated using a light use efficiency model. Both can be related to vegetation properties observed by optical remote sensing. The model has only two fitting parameters: maximum light use efficiency, and the minimum achieved ratio of internal to external CO2 concentration. The two parameters were estimated using data from 16 eddy covariance flux towers for six major biomes including both energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=792485779504353354", "cites_id": ["792485779504353354"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715001121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:StDnIJ55_woJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
