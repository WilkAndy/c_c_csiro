A novel feature of the instrument is a rotating periscope connected to a spectrometer via a fiber optic cable. Canopy reflectances are calculated for multiple view azimuths, at a single zenith angle from measurements of spectrometer dark current, incoming solar irradiance and reflected radiances. Spectral measurements are made between 300 and 1150 nm wavelength at a band-to-band spacing of 3 nm, and a bandwidth (full-width, half maximum) of 10 nm. Preliminary data analysis showed that the canopy reflectance model of Kuusk [Kuusk, A. (1995). A fast, invertible canopy reflectance model.
