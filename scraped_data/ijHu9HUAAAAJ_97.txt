Instrumentedtowers, aircraft and atmospheric sondes were used for measurements overthree paired sites (crops and pastures), approximately equi-spaced along an88-km transect in south-eastern New South Wales, Australia, during the australsprings of 1994 and 1995. Measurements included standard meteorologicaldata and the fluxes of solar and net radiation, sensible heat, water vapour andthe greenhouse gases CO2, N2O, CH4. Descriptions of the site, andthe spatial and temporal variations of climate fields and fluxes, are presented.There were strong contrasts in fluxes and surface conductances, evaporationratios and water use efficiencies between the 1994 drought year and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14644221218063894540", "cites_id": ["14644221218063894540"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026028217081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DMjvApy5OssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
