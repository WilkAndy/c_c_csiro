On hourly timescales we find that incoming shortwave radiation is the major meteorological driver of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE). Light use efficiency is higher under diffuse light conditions and carbon uptake is further modulated by the effects of variable and suboptimal temperatures (optimal temperature Topt = 18 \u00b0C) as well as by water demand (critical vapour pressure deficit VPDcrit = 12 hPa). Incoming shortwave radiation is also the major driver on daily time scales. Effects of increased light use efficiency under diffuse conditions, however, are overcompensated by the increased carbon uptake with larger amounts of total incoming shortwave \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ijHu9HUAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9969589916998195485", "cites_id": ["9969589916998195485"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313001044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HVn-VjUZW4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
