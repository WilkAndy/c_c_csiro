Degradation of APEs in wastewater treatment plants or in the environment generates more persistent shorter-chain APEs and alkylphenols (APs) such as nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and AP mono- to triethoxylates (NPE1, NPE2 and NPE3). There is concern that APE metabolites (NP, OP, NPE1\u20133) can mimic natural hormones and that the levels present in the environment may be sufficient to disrupt endocrine function in wildlife and humans. The physicochemical properties of the APE metabolites (NP, NPE1\u20134, OP, OPE1\u20134), in particular the high Kow values, indicate that they will partition effectively into sediments following discharge from STPs. The aqueous solubility data for the APE metabolites indicate that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 1395, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4668817895091198300", "cites_id": ["4668817895091198300"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041200200017X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XNnlnSP5ykAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 11, "2004": 46, "2005": 63, "2006": 63, "2007": 86, "2008": 68, "2009": 91, "2010": 73, "2011": 103, "2012": 87, "2013": 99, "2014": 80, "2015": 79, "2016": 84, "2017": 63, "2018": 51, "2019": 68, "2020": 54, "2021": 51, "2022": 46, "2023": 16}}
