This study investigated the occurrence of TCS in effluents, biosolids and surface waters, and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The aqueous concentrations of TCS in nineteen effluents from Australian WWTPs ranged from 23 ng/L to 434 ng/L with a median concentration of 108 ng/L, while its concentrations in nineteen biosolids ranged from 0.09 mg/kg to 16.79 mg/kg on dry weight basis with a median concentration of 2.32 mg/kg. The removal rates for TCS in five selected WWTPs were found to range between 72% and 93%. Biological degradation was believed to be the predominant removal mechanism for TCS in the WWTPs. However, adsorption onto sludge also played a significant role in the removal of TCS in the WWTPs. TCS at concentrations up to 75 ng/L was detected in surface waters (outfall, upstream \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 437, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1130457628620442097", "cites_id": ["1130457628620442097"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412006001437", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8UmNSzkxsA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 33, "2010": 42, "2011": 37, "2012": 24, "2013": 28, "2014": 29, "2015": 33, "2016": 39, "2017": 27, "2018": 28, "2019": 32, "2020": 23, "2021": 22, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
