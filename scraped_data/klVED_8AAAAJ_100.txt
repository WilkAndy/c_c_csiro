The soils were contaminated with a range of pesticides, especially with triazine herbicides. With multiple extractions of each soil sample with deionised water (eight in total), 15% of atrazine and 4% of simazine residues were recovered, resulting in very high concentrations of the two herbicides in leachate. The presence of small fractions of surfactants was found to further enhance the release of the residues. Methanol content up to 10% did not substantially influence the concentration of simazine and atrazine released. The study demonstrated that while the stabilisation of contaminated soil with particulate activated carbon (5%) and cement mix (15%) was effective in locking the residues of some pesticides, it failed to immobilise triazine herbicides residues \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11672205921819288498", "cites_id": ["11672205921819288498"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749104003252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:suM_o3EB_KEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
