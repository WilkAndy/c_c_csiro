Due to the extraordinary ability of biochars to bind organic compounds, plant uptake experiments were conducted to assess the effect of soil-amendment of three different biochars on the uptake of APIs from spiked soil.Pot experiments were undertaken to assess the extent of sorption and corresponding bioaccessibility of two APIs (carbamazepine - CBZ and propranolol -PRL) to ryegrass (Lolium perenne) grown in an API-spiked loamy sand, with and without biochar amendment (5 t/ha equivalent). The soil was amended with three different biochars produced from eucalyptus wood and wheat residues.Both APIs were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16014501505407520290", "cites_id": ["16014501505407520290"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-015-2421-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ig7GTEXwPt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
