We investigated the bioconcentration of TCS and Me-TCS in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to TCS (100 ng L\u22121) for 30 days in seawater aquaria (19 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) with fresh phytoplankton as a food source. Bioconcentration increased with time reaching a steady-state around 24\u201330 days. The bioconcentration factor (log BCF) for TCS were 2.81 L kg\u22121 (dry weight) and 4.13 L kg\u22121, when lipid normalised concentrations were used. Mussels were also deployed in cages at four marine locations receiving effluents from WWTPs. The mean (\u00b1SD) TCS and Me-TCS concentrations for mussels from these sites were 9.87 (\u00b11.34) and 6.99 (\u00b12.44) \u03bcg kg\u22121. The study showed that mussels can be a useful tool for monitoring pollution of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11814193224022925363", "cites_id": ["11814193224022925363"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X13004177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M6C2mSRy9KMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
