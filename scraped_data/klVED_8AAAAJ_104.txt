MM1, readily hydrolysed fenamiphos, a widely used organophosphorus insecticide and its toxic oxides (fenamiphos sulfoxide, fenamiphos sulfone), which all contain a common P\u2013O\u2013C bond, in a mineral salts medium. The bacterium also hydrolysed fenamiphos and its oxides in soil and groundwater. Interestingly, fenamiphos phenol, fenamiphos sulfoxide phenol and fenamiphos sulfone phenol, formed during bacterial hydrolysis of fenamiphos and its oxides, persisted in the mineral salts medium, but were transitory in soil and groundwater due to their further metabolism by indigenous micro-organisms. The cell-free preparation (crude enzyme) of this bacterium was very effective in hydrolysing fenamiphos. This is the first report on exceptionally rapid hydrolysis of fenamiphos by a bacterium in pure cultures, soil and groundwater."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5909989809694072838", "cites_id": ["5909989809694072838"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-002-1206-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BmD-YGuABFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
