The original model assumed a decreasing rate of pesticide degradation but a constant organic matter content with depth in the soil profile. A modified version of the model was developed to take into account the generally decreasing organic matter contents with depth in the soil profile. Residual masses and travel times of 40 pesticides were calculated by the model using sorption and degradation data available from the literature. The calculations based on the constant OM mode predicted that for a recharge rate of 0-5 m/yr, some 14 of the pesticides were likely to reach ground water at appreciable levels of the residue (>0.1% of applied mass). The number increased to 21 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13581835324789560258", "cites_id": ["13581835324789560258"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9941141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:whPvq0RffLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
