The most likely source of this commonly used bactericide to the area is a wastewater outfall discharging at the confluence of the inlet with marine waters. Triclosan was detected in all samples, at concentrations (5\u201327 \u03bcg kg\u22121) comparable to values found in other surface sediments under the influence of marine wastewater outfalls. Its dispersal was closely associated with fine and organic-rich fractions of the sediments. Methyl-triclosan was detected in approximately half of the samples at concentrations <11 \u03bcg kg\u22121. The occurrence of this compound was linked to both wastewater discharges and biological methylation of the parent compound. Wastewater-borne methyl-triclosan had a smaller spatial footprint than triclosan and was mostly deposited in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14487866746891626285", "cites_id": ["14487866746891626285"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/em/c0em00612b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LWer2Qs-D8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
