The soil samples were extracted with acetonitrile, while the water samples were extracted using C18 cartridges. The mean recoveries plus standard deviations for spiked soil samples were 82 \u00b1 4.2% for thiamethoxam, 99 \u00b1 4.2% for imidacloprid and 94 \u00b1 1.4% for thiacloprid. The recoveries for water samples ranged from 87 \u00b1 3.4% for thiamethoxam to 97 \u00b1 3.9% for imidacloprid and 97 \u00b1 2.6% for thiacloprid. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.1, 0.1, 0.01 mg/kg in soil (5 g), and 2, 2, 0.5 \u00b5g/L in water (50 mL) for thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9973721914400204200", "cites_id": ["9973721914400204200"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/lesb-200030808", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qGVa9DzHaYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
