This laboratory study examined the degradation of four commonly found organic compounds, 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol, bisphenol A, and triclosan, in soil following the addition of two biosolids over 32weeks. The pattern of degradation was assessed to determine if it followed a standard first-order decay model or if a biphasic model with a degrading and a recalcitrant fraction better described the data. The time taken for the initial concentrations to decrease by 50% (DT50), based on a first-order model, was 12\u201325d for 4-nonylphenol, 10\u201314d for 4-t-octylphenol, 18\u2013102d for bisphenol A, and 73\u2013301d for triclosan. For 4-nonylphenol, bisphenol A and triclosan, the biphasic model fitted the degradation data better than the first-order model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3704963732069588111", "cites_id": ["3704963732069588111"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653511006230", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j5y2c-KsajMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 5}}
