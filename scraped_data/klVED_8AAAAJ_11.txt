Their biodegradation behaviour in soil was investigated by laboratory degradation experiments and environmental fate modelling. Quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) analyses showed that triclocarban and triclosan had a tendency to partition into soil or sediment in the environment. Fate modelling suggests that either triclocarban or triclosan \u201cdoes not degrade fast\u201d with its primary biodegradation half-life of \u201cweeks\u201d and ultimate biodegradation half-life of \u201cmonths\u201d. Laboratory experiments showed that triclocarban and triclosan were degraded in the aerobic soil with half-life of 108 days and 18 days, respectively. No negative effect of these two antimicrobial agents on soil microbial activity was observed in the aerobic soil samples during the experiments. But these two compounds persisted in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 435, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2624667131700955595", "cites_id": ["2624667131700955595"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749107001108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y8mtptmwbCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 25, "2010": 48, "2011": 34, "2012": 30, "2013": 22, "2014": 39, "2015": 37, "2016": 40, "2017": 30, "2018": 41, "2019": 21, "2020": 27, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 7}}
