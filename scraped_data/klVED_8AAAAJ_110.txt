This experience has led to the concern that these herbicides may degrade very slowly in alkaline soils, and herbicide residues have at times been blamed for unexplained crop losses. To address this issue, we established 5 recropping trials across Victoria and South Australia with 5 acetolactate synthase herbicides (chlorsulfuron, triasulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl, imazethapyr, and flumetsulam). The herbicides were applied to separate plots in years 1, 2 or 3, and sensitive crop species were sown in year 4 to measure the impact of herbicide residues. We observed that the persistence of the sulfonylureas (chlorsulfuron, triasulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl) varied between herbicides, but all persisted longer in alkaline soils than in acid soils, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6986466989425785779", "cites_id": ["6986466989425785779"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea05053", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s3u3A7bq9GAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 4}}
