Soil samples with known concentrations between 0.1 and 10 \u03bcg ai kgA1 chlorsulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl or triasulfuron were prepared by an independent laboratory and supplied in coded bags to separate laboratories for testing. The accuracy of the results was analysed, and the merits of each method are discussed. Bioassay was suitable for measuring biologically active residues from 0.1 to 1.0 \u03bcg ai kgA1. ELISA accurately measured residues in the range of 0.1\u00b110 \u03bcg ai kgA1, making it the most widely adaptable assay tested. It will be useful for measuring residues in sodic subsoils where bioassay plants grow poorly. There was good reproducibility between the bioassay and ELISA. The hplc technique used in this study was not as accurate as bioassay or ELISA at quantifying residues of 3.0\u00b110 \u03bcg ai kgA1 and could not detect residues at or below 1.0 \u03bcg ai kgA1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11466059903573851911", "cites_id": ["11466059903573851911"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/47909957/Hollaway_et_al_1999_Comparison_of_sulfonylurea_herbicide_residue_detection_in_soil_by_bioassay_ELIZA_and_HPLC.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B3_ehbugH58J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
