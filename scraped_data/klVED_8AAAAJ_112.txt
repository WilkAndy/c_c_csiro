The net surface charge became less negative with decreasing pH (from 7.5 to 3.5) in all soils. The rate of change in net surface charge varied from \u22120.6 to \u22122.8\u202f(cmol/kg)/pH unit. The effect on sorption behaviour of PFASs was variable among soils. For two soils, the average sorption increased 54- and 45-fold for PFOS, 33- and 9-fold for PFOA, and 39- and 400-fold for PFHxS, across the pH range 7.5 to 3.5. Sorption in another sandier soil showed negligible change with decreasing pH. Sorption in the other soils did not change significantly until the pH decreased to approximately 5.5. The soils with high contents of sesquioxides (Fe and Al oxides) showed the most marked increase in sorption with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10576685749419188428", "cites_id": ["10576685749419188428"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719315748", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zCARw6bvx5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 15, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
