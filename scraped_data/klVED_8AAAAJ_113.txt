In this study, the selective degradation of enantiomers of the three imidazolinone herbicides, imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazaquin, was determined in a variety of soils selected to cover a broad range of physico-chemical characteristics. The R(+) enantiomer of all three herbicides, which has greater herbicidal activity (up to eight times), was found to degrade faster than the less active S(\u2212) enantiomer. The enantiomer fraction (EF) was used as a descriptor of enantio-selectivity of the imidazolinone herbicides. The EF values increased with increasing incubation time for imidazolinones with a fast initial phase followed by a slower phase. While the enantio-selectivity was not significant in acidic soils (pHw 5.02 and 5.20), it was highly significant (P<0.001) in alkaline soils (pHw 7.6, 8.2 and 8.7).
