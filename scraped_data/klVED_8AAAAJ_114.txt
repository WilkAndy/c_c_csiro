In this study, we investigated leaching and persistence of 3 commonly used herbicides (chlorsulfuron, triasulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl) in alkaline soils of south-eastern Australia (pH range 7.4\u20138.6) for at least 4 years after treatment. In general, chlorsulfuron was predicted to persist for 3\u20135 years [time to degrade to 1% (DT99) of 33\u201363 months after treatment depending on the field site], triasulfuron for 1\u20133 years (DT99 of 13\u201337 months after treatment), and metsulfuron-methyl for less than 1 year (although data were insufficient for degradation estimates) after its application. However, this varied between sites and years of application. Although, the majority of residues remained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8364036848089749256", "cites_id": ["8364036848089749256"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/EA04221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CNeq4jIHE3QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
