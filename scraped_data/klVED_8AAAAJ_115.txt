This NEPM, which was published in 1999, consists of a number of schedules. Schedule B (1) provides the ecological, groundwater and human health investigation levels (EILs, GILs and HILs respectively) which if exceeded act to trigger further investigation, in the form of a risk assessment. Schedule B (5) provides a framework to be used when conducting ecological risk assessments for contaminated sites.The NEPM was reviewed in 2006 and the Review Report made 27 recommendations on aspects of the NEPM that could be improved. Two recommendations related to the EILs including the development of a new methodology for deriving EILs and the derivation of new EILs. The Review Report was accepted and endorsed by the National Environment Protection Council and the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) and approval was granted for a variation of the NEPM to proceed. A team, the NEPM Variation Team, was assigned responsibility for conducting the variation of the NEPM. The task of addressing these recommendations on EILs was awarded to CSIRO and NSW DECCW who received funding for this from the Environmental Trust."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16174596020284996334", "cites_id": ["16174596020284996334"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43723534/The_Australian_methodology_to_derive_eco20160314-2979-1sfakq9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7rqIPmK1d-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
