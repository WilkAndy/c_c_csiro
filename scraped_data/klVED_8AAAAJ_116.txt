We studied the transformation/degradation of fenamiphos under controlled conditions, in surface and subsurface soils from the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia. In the sandy surface soil, fenamiphos (Fen) was rapidly oxidised to its sulfoxide (FenSO) analogue. Further oxidation of FenSO to sulfone (FenSO2), however, was found to be very slow, resulting in an accumulation of FenSO. Little accumulation of FenSO2 occurred during the study period (139 days). The time taken for 50% loss of the total residue of fenamiphos (Fen+FenSO+FenSO2) was found to be approximately 50 days in the surface soil and about 140 days in the subsurface soil. Simulations using the LEACHM model showed that the rate of transformation of Fen to FenSO in the surface soil (k1 = 0\u00b75/day) was 100 times faster \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1039325824362518537", "cites_id": ["1039325824362518537"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/S96105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CZgEp1RtbA4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
