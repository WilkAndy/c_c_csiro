Among these NPs are those based on silver (Ag), which are found sulphidised (e.g. silver sulphide, Ag2S) in biosolids. Herein, our aim was to examine the release of retained Ag0 and Ag2S NPs in soils and biosolids as facilitated by environmentally and agriculturally relevant ligands. Under natural soil conditions, exemplified by potassium nitrate and humic acid experiments, release of Ag retained in soil was limited. The highest total Ag release was facilitated by ligands that simulated root exudates (citrate) or fertilisers (thiosulphate). Released Ag was predominantly present in the colloidal phase (>3 kDa\u2013< 0.45 \u03bcm); intact NPs only identified in Ag2S-NP extracts. For biosolids containing nanoparticulate-Ag-S, release was also enhanced by thiosulphate, though mostly as colloidal-Ag \u2013 not intact NPs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4734208686137545691", "cites_id": ["4734208686137545691"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114002383", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2xPMlbdJs0EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
