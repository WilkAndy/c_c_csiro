To examine the role of charcoal in the sorption and desorption behaviors of diuron pesticide in soil, synthetic charcoals were produced through carbonization of red gum (Eucalyptus spp.) wood chips at 450 and 850 \u00b0C (referred to as charcoals BC450 and BC850, respectively, in this paper). Pore size distribution analyses revealed that BC850 contained mainly micropores (pores \u2248 0.49 nm mean width), whereas BC450 was essentially not a microporous material. Short-term equilibration (<24 h) tests were conducted to measure sorption and desorption of diuron in a soil amended with various amounts of charcoals of both types. The sorption coefficients, isotherm nonlinearity, and apparent sorption\u2212desorption hysteresis markedly increased with increasing content of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 337, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5192944314121204340", "cites_id": ["5192944314121204340"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf061354y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dDKUHVcLEUgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 12, "2010": 17, "2011": 23, "2012": 19, "2013": 29, "2014": 23, "2015": 38, "2016": 22, "2017": 26, "2018": 30, "2019": 18, "2020": 19, "2021": 19, "2022": 29, "2023": 5}}
