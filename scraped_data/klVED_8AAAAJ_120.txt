However, the new technology for exploiting these reserves, termed hydraulic fracturing, raises several environmental issues. We discuss the research required to assess the ecological risks from gas recovery.                Abstract       Coal seam gas reserves represent a major contribution to energy needs, however, gas recovery by hydraulic fracturing (fracking or fraccing), requires management to minimise any environmental effects. Although the industry is adapting where possible to more benign fracking chemicals, there is still a lack of information on exposure to natural and added chemicals, and their fate and ecotoxicity in both the discharged produced and flow-back waters. Geogenic contaminants mobilised from the coal seams during fracking may add to the mixture of chemicals with the potential to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8450552191833949742", "cites_id": ["8450552191833949742"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en12136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LkYpDnJkRnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
