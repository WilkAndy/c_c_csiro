During the production of wood pulp, large volumes of liquid effluents (up to 200,000 m3 d-1) are produced (Johnson and Ryder 1988), which are traditionally discharged to aquatic environments. Adverse effects of this practice on marine and freshwater biota have been noted (Higashi et al. 1992; Hodson et al. 1992). Discharge of pulp mill effluents on land is increasingly being recognized not only as an alternate method of effluent disposal but also as a resource providing water and nutrients to crops (Kannan et al. 1990). This method relies on soil processes to ameliorate potentially toxic components (March- and 1971; Johnson and Ryder 1988)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2977245174549918050", "cites_id": ["2977245174549918050"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4252-9_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YjFLTrZMUSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
