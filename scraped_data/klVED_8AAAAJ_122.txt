Sorption may be dependent on soil moisture conditions, but limited data are available from which to elucidate the effect. Our objective was to determine the effect of soil water content on the sorption coefficient of a hydrophilic pesticide. Sorption of dicamba (3,6\u2010dichloro\u20102\u2010methoxybenzoic acid) was measured in three soils, each at two initial water contents. At low water contents (\u223c0.05 kg kg\u22121), sorption coefficients were similar for all three soils, ranging from 0.01 L kg\u22121 for the loamy sand to 0.07 L kg\u22121 for the silty clay loam. At higher water contents (0.19\u20130.24 kg kg\u22121), the sorption coefficient for the loamy sand was unchanged, for the silt loam it was doubled, and for the silty clay loam it was increased almost sixfold. Multiple regression analysis revealed a strong linear relationship between the sorption coefficient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15952434953899280407", "cites_id": ["15952434953899280407"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2006.0091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FwixKRJvYt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
