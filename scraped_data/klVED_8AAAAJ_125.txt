The movement and degradation of a new termiticide, fipronil, were investigated in Australian soils following standard termiticide treatment methods (surface application under slab and trenching treatments along walls). Surface application studies in three field sites showed slow dissipation and little movement for fipronil in all three soils under the simulated slab during a three\u2010year period. The greatest mass of the chemical residues remained in the quartzite sand layer (thickness, 5 cm), and only small amounts of these were found to have migrated into the soil layers (depth, 0\u201315 cm) underneath the quartzite sand layer.
