The most common approach for treating contaminated water currently relies on removal of PFAS by sorption. The spent sorbents loaded with PFAS can potentially be disposed of at landfills, provided the sorbed contaminants remain sequestered and certain risk criteria are met. Hence, it is essential that remediation sorbents (i) rapidly adsorb a large variety of PFAS under varying water chemistry conditions, and (ii) do not release the adsorbed PFAS in due course. This review aims at establishing the current state of knowledge about the potential release of PFAS that may occur during and after treatment. The scientific literature currently provides data for a very restricted range of long-chain PFAS. Our knowledge of the dynamics of PFAS adsorption processes on engineered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12321105093327382726", "cites_id": ["12321105093327382726"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720362999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xugIaM1b_aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 13, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
