The excitation and emission wavelengths of the fluorescence detector were 230 nm and 290 nm, respectively. The selected endocrine disrupting chemicals include hormone steroids such as estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), ethynylestradiol (EE2), and ethynylestradiol 3-methyl ether (MeEE2) as well as nonylphenols (NP), octylphenols (OP), POE(1-2) nonyl phenol (NPE) and bisphenol A (BP). Three types of on-line cartridges (C18, PLRP-s and PRP-1) were tested to pre-concentrate the endocrine disruptors in deionised water. It was found that the recoveries of these chemicals at 1 \u03bcg/L were close to 100% except for 4-octyl phenol and 4-n-nonyl phenol, which had recoveries of about 40% to 80%.
