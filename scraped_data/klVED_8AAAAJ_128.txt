A wide variation in sorption affinities of the soils to carbaryl and phosalone was observed. The sorption coefficient (K d) values for carbaryl ranged from 0.19 to 23.0 L/kg in Australian soils, from 0.99 to 59.7 L/kg in Pakistani soils, and from 1.09 to 23.0 L/kg in the UK soils. The K d values for phosalone ranged from 4.8 to 443 L/kg in Australian soils, from 15.5 to 1182 L/kg in Pakistani soils, and from 18.1 to 205 L/kg in the UK soils. To eliminate the effect of variation in organic carbon content among the soils, the K d values were normalised to the fraction of soil organic carbon (K oc ). However, K oc values for both pesticides varied by about an order of magnitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11871671776832285951", "cites_id": ["11871671776832285951"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR00021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_2weDJWmwKQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
