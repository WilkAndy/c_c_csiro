The method involves extraction of soils with 0.1 M NaHCO3 solution and subsequent preconcentration by using C18 cartridges prior to separation of the pesticide using CZE. The results show that a C18 cartridge is suitable for the purification of sulfonylurea herbicides in soil extracts with the recoveries ranging from 65\u2013103%. The separation conditions affecting the resolution and detection sensitivity was systematically investigated. The sulfonylureas were resolved well using 30 mM sodium acetate (NaAc)/acetic acid (HAc)+10% acetonitrile (ACN) buffer at pH 4.80. The calibration plots for the test solutes in the concentration of 0.2\u201350 mg L\u22121 were linear with detection limits in the range of 0.05\u20130.10 mgL\u22121.
