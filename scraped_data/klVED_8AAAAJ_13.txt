This study explored the fate and uptake of pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diclofenac, fluoxetine, propranolol, sulfamethazine) and a personal care product (triclosan) in soil\u2013plant systems using radish (Raphanus sativus) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Five of the six chemicals were detected in plant tissue. Carbamazepine was taken up to the greatest extent in both the radish (52 \u03bcg/g) and ryegrass (33 \u03bcg/g), whereas sulfamethazine uptake was below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) (<0.01 \u03bcg/g). In the soil, concentrations of diclofenac and sulfamethazine dropped below the LOQ after 7 days. However, all pharmaceuticals were still detectable in the pore water at the end of the experiment. The results demonstrate the ability of plant species to accumulate pharmaceuticals from soils with uptake apparently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13988433882735549811", "cites_id": ["13988433882735549811"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf404282y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c519oIDmIMIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 20, "2016": 36, "2017": 32, "2018": 43, "2019": 44, "2020": 44, "2021": 48, "2022": 38, "2023": 19}}
