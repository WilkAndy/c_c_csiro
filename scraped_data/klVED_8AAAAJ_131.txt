Hydrolysis, where it occurred, and photodegradation both followed first-order kinetics for all herbicides. There was no hydrolysis of any of the herbicides in buffer solutions at pH 3 or pH 7; however, slow hydrolysis occurred at pH 9. Estimated half-lives for the three herbicides in solution in the dark were 6.5, 9.2 and 9.6 months for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. Degradation of the herbicides in the light was considerably more rapid than in the dark with half lives for the three herbicides of 1.8, 9.8 and 9.1 days for imazaquin, imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13763673872333735968", "cites_id": ["13763673872333735968"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03601230701794968", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IAjHvHZkAr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
