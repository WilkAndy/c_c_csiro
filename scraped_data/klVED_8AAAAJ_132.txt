As their labels recommend recropping periods of up to 34 months for imazethapyr and 24 months for flumetsulam, there are concerns that in some cases their persistence may damage subsequent rotation crops. This is the first major study in south-eastern Australia to investigate their leaching and persistence for up to 4 years after treatment. Imazethapyr persisted for more than 3 years at 2 sites and flumetsulam for more than 2 years at 3 sites. For imazethapyr, soil type (clay content) rather than soil pH seemed to be most important in determining persistence, with residues of 10% of applied imazethapyr predicted to persist for 24 months after treatment in clay soil and 5 months after treatment in sandy soil. The potential for leaching below our studied soil depth of 40 cm is of concern for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2107135580240629601", "cites_id": ["2107135580240629601"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/ea04223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YU_UaaUMPh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
