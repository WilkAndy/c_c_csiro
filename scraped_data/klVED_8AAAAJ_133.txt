The surface horizon (0\u201315 cm) of the soil profile was alkaline (pH 7.9) and the subsurface horizon (50\u201390 cm) was acidic (pH 3.9). Aqua-regia extractable Cr concentration ranged from 62 g/kg in the surface to 0.26 g/kg in the subsurface soils. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic studies revealed the predominance of carbonate and kaolin minerals in the surface soils, and highly weathered framboidal particles, with morphology similar to that of pyrites, in the subsurface soils. The amount of Cr desorbed from the contaminated soils varied considerably with both the electrolyte\u2019s cationic charge and soil properties.
