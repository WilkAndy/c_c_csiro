We compared the performances of VNIR and MIR spectroscopy for predicting both organic carbon content (fOC) and the sorption affinity (Kd) of diuron in 112 surface soils from South Australia. Separate calibration models were developed between VNIR and MIR spectra, and fOC and Kd using partial least-squares (PLS) regression. MIR clearly outperformed VNIR for predictions of both fOC and Kd in soils. Correlation (R2) and accuracy (RPD) indices were 0.4 and 1.3 for the VNIR-PLS model versus 0.8 and 2.3 for the MIR-PLS model, respectively, for Kd prediction. PLS loadings for sorption prediction were compared in terms of the soil information they contained. While VNIR loading did not include any direct spectral information regarding soil minerals, MIR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7236504730896272260", "cites_id": ["7236504730896272260"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es8029945", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hIuBTLY6bWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
