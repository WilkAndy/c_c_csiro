A calibration set of 101 surface soils collected from South Australia was utilized for reference sorption data and MIR spectra. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the spectra to detect spectral outliers. The MIR-PLS model was developed and validated by dividing the initial data set into four validation sets. The model resulted in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.69, a standard error (SE) of 5.57, and a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 1.63. The normalized sorption coefficient for the organic compound (KOC) approach, on the other hand, resulted in R2, SE, and RPD values of 0.42, 7.26, and 1.25, respectively. However, the significant statistical difference between the two models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8645264853405187458", "cites_id": ["8645264853405187458"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702750d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gr1iYJQm-ncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
