For 100 different soils, the Kd values of spiked radiolabelled 14C-PFOA ranged from 0.6 to 14.8\u202fL/kg and significantly decreased with soil depth (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) due to soil properties that change with depth. The MLR modelling revealed that PFOA sorption was significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) influenced, in decreasing order, by organic carbon (OC) content, silt-plus-clay content and soil pH. Soils were partitioned into all soils and surface soils alone. The MLR models using OC, silt-plus-clay content and pH together explained most of the variation in sorption in all soils as well as surface soils alone (0-15\u202fcm).
