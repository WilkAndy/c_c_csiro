It has been found persistent in various aquatic environments. Our investigation found that benzotriazole can be rapidly transformed under UV light to form several photoproducts. Photolysis rates decreased with increasing solution pH, whereas salinity had no significant effect. Metal species Cu2+ and Fe3+, and humic acid in aquatic environment could have inhibitory effects on the photolysis of benzotriazole. Abstract Benzotriazole (BT) is an anti-corrosion agent used widely in some industrial processes and household products, and it has been detected in surface water and ground water due to its high mobility and low biodegradability. We have investigated the photolysis of benzotriazole in aqueous solutions under UV radiation at 254\u2009nm and the effect of pH, salinity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16505187051584918292", "cites_id": ["16505187051584918292"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN10141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FJMY2Sw0DuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
