Therefore there is a paucity of data relating to the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals once they enter an aquatic receiving system. The amount of work that needs to be done in terms of risk assessment for pharmaceuticals required by regulatory agencies is substantial. This paper has determined the environmental partitioning coefficient (Kd) of 13 diverse human pharmaceuticals in three model systems of differing combinations of solid phases and solutions. The Kd values were then compared with distribution values of the pharmaceuticals in the human body determined from pharmacological studies. This was done to assess the functional relationship between Kd and distribution values in the human body (VD). Kd values ranged from 3 to 2450Lkg\u22121. Regression coefficients ranged from r2=0.62\u20130 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2069390080618596318", "cites_id": ["2069390080618596318"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653506007004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3gf9cFDztxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
