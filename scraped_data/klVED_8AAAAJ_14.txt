However, the implications of such amendments to the environmental fate and efficacy of pesticides are not well understood. The published work on the role of black carbon (which includes charcoal, soot, and other pyrolytic carbon materials) in the environmental fate and effect of organic contaminants is reviewed here, together with the studies on bioavailability and efficacy of some herbicides in soils amended with freshly produced biochars. Biochars, due to their unique properties especially their highly carbonaceous and aromatic nature and high specific surface area, have been reported to be up to >2000 times more effective than soil in sorbing pesticides.
