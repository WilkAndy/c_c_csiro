The results showed that the distributions of water content, Br\u2013 , and the 3 herbicides were influenced by the amount of rainfall/irrigation received, and the biological activity as well as the physico-chemical properties of the soil within the profile. The largest concentrations of Br\u2013 were detected in the 10\u201320 cm depth under both treatments. No additional peak of Br\u2013 was observed in the plots which received only rainfall; however, there was another peak at 100 cm depth after a cumulative rainfall and irrigation of 158 mm.
