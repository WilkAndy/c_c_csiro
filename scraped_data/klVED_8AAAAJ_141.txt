In this work, the photolysis of two antidepressants, amisulpride and desipramine, has been investigated in both ultrapure water and wastewater under simulated solar irradiation. Results showed that for amisulpride short irradiation times (t1/2 approximately 3 h in pure water and 4 h in wastewater) were adequate to degrade the parent compound while a longer exposure period was required for desipramine (t1/2 of approximately 36 h in pure water), although its degradation is enhanced almost three times by indirect photolysis in wastewaters. A significant number of transformation products (TPs) were identified for both pharmaceuticals by high-resolution mass spectrometry. In general, TPs formed are not persistent although acute toxicity tests for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9854320114438767023", "cites_id": ["9854320114438767023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969715301960", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rwEcBO-TwYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
