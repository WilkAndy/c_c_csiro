In Queensland, Australia, the runoff of PSII inhibitor herbicides (in particular diuron and atrazine) is a major concern due to their potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef. This study compared the conventional practice of broadcast application of herbicides in sugarcane production across the whole field with the banded application of particular herbicides onto raised beds only using a shielded sprayer. This study found that the application of two moderately soluble herbicides, diuron and atrazine, to only the raised beds decreased the average total load of both herbicides moving off-site by > 90% compared with the conventional treatment. This was despite the area being covered with the herbicides by the banded application being only 60% less than with the conventional treatment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3550004905368129886", "cites_id": ["3550004905368129886"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713009017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XpFcF6cmRDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
