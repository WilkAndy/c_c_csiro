We investigated the role of three common cations (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) at varying solution concentrations on the sorption coefficients (Kd) of 18 anionic PFAS in two contrasting soils. The effective charge of the soil suspension (Zeta potential) became less negative as the concentration of these cations increased in the soil solutions. Perfluorinated compounds showed greater sorption than polyfluorinated compounds, with sulfonates of comparable chain lengths showing higher sorption than the carboxylates. We observed that the Kd values of several PFAS in the two soils were positively correlated with the concentration of cations in solution, especially in the presence of polyvalent cations (Ca2+and Mg2+). The changes in sorption with cation concentration were more prominent for long-chain PFAS, with C\u202f>\u202f10 PFAS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1541966832376566271", "cites_id": ["1541966832376566271"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972200064X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_1E9E6oqZhUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 16, "2023": 17}}
