Industry and regulatory agencies need a consolidated and comprehensive framework and guidance for human health risk assessments. In this perspective we develop such a comprehensive framework by exploring two case studies from relevant product types: an active ingredient delivered with a nanocarrier system, and a nanoparticle as an active ingredient. For a nanocarrier system, three entities are tracked during the assessment: the nanocarrier\u2013active ingredient complex, the empty nanocarrier remaining after the complete release of the active ingredient, and the released active ingredient. For the nanoparticle of pure active ingredient, only two entities are relevant: the nanoparticle and the released ions. We suggest important adaptations of the existing pesticide framework to determine the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18246231462011434510", "cites_id": ["18246231462011434510"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-021-00964-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Dna_jteiN_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 18, "2023": 13}}
