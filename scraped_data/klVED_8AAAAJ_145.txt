Therefore, we studied the sorption of chlorothalonil, fenamiphos, and its 2 metabolites (fenamiphos sulfone and fenamiphos sulfoxide), by batch method on 6 surface soils from the Guayas River Basin (1\u20133\u00b0S, 79\u201381\u00b0W), a major banana production area of Ecuador. The sorption of chlorothalonil on the 6 soils was high and varied considerably as shown by the Kd values ranging from 68.50 to 152.60 L/kg. The sorption coefficients normalised with the organic carbon content of soil (Koc) for chlorothalonil ranged from 2330 to 7336 kg/L, with a mean value of 4012 kg/L. These Koc values are higher than those previously reported in the literature. The sorption of fenamiphos and its metabolites to the 6 soils varied among soils in a similar pattern.
