Residues were both mobile and persistent at low levels. Leaching occurred beyond the lowest sampling depth during the winter\u2013spring growing season. Metsulfuron-methyl was the most mobile of the 3 herbicides. Plant-back experiments involving susceptible crop and pasture species on 2 of the sites showed that the rates of decline of these residues in the sampling zone were slower than might be inferred from label plant-back recommendations in 1 of 2 seasons."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8211609670312908292", "cites_id": ["8211609670312908292"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea98097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BNYp-Xx_9XEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
