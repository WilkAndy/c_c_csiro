During ASR, attenuation processes such as sorption and degradation may play an important role in removing trace organic contaminants in injected waste water. This study mainly investigated the role of treated sewage effluent injectant (the waste water injected into the aquifer) on degradation of two endocrine disrupting compounds, 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol (E2) and 17\u03b1\u2010ethynylestradiol (EE2), in the laboratory by comparing their behavior in incubation media\u2014aquifer sediment/ground water slurry from the Bolivar experimental ASR site in South Australia and sediment/effluent slurry. Biodegradation of the two compounds in the sediment/ground water media (1:1, w/w) and in the sediment/effluent media (1:1, w/w) were conducted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 20\u00b0C.
