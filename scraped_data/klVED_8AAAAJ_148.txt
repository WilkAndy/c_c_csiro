Pesticide use has increased substantially in Australia and globally over the last two decades, partly due to changes in tillage practices. Some 400 chemically active ingredients, of varying properties, are currently available in Australia alone. Pesticide residues have been found, mostly at acceptable levels, in food commodities and in surface and ground water bodies in Australia. Such contamination needs to be minimized. However, the variety of pesticides, their use under a range of soil and climatic conditions and the complexity of processes governing their fate make this task particularly daunting. Furthermore, as little local data is available for Australian conditions, there is danger in extrapolating overseas Temperate Zone data, especially for risk assessment in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7125238583642649898", "cites_id": ["7125238583642649898"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00103620009370530", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KnXtnb3u4WIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
