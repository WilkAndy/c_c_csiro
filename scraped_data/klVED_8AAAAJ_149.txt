Under aerobic conditions, SMX dissipated rapidly through biodegradation but TRM was more persistent. Within the first 20 days in biologically active soils, >50% of the SMX was lost from the clay loam and loamy sand soils, and >80% loss was noted in the loam soil. Anaerobic dissipation of both compounds was more rapid than aerobic dissipation. The addition of manure to the soil only slightly increased the initial dissipation rate of the two compounds. Little effect was found on glucose mineralisation in soil following the addition of SMX and TRM, even as mixtures at high concentrations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5310434934333167210", "cites_id": ["5310434934333167210"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03601234.2012.636580", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:atbA1290skkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
