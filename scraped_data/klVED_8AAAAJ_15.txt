The SOM was characterized using carbon types derived from the NMR spectra. Relationships were determined between Koc (sorption per unit organic C) of carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) and phosalone (S-6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2-oxobenzoxazol-3-ylmethyl O,O-diethyl phosphorodithioate) and the nature of organic matter in the soils. Substantial variations were revealed in the structural composition of organic matter in the soils studied. The variations in Koc values of the pesticides observed for the soils could be explained only when variations in the aromatic components of SOM were taken into consideration. The highly significant positive correlations of aromaticity of SOM and Koc values of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16341045234660859530", "cites_id": ["16341045234660859530"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es001446i", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:it6M9g8Ox-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 17, "2003": 14, "2004": 19, "2005": 22, "2006": 20, "2007": 12, "2008": 28, "2009": 18, "2010": 21, "2011": 12, "2012": 17, "2013": 18, "2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 16, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 11}}
