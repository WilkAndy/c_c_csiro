We compare the fate of nano- and conventional forms of copper, in particular their resistance to wash-off by rain (rainfastness), following their application to citrus leaves. Results showing large differences between the formulations in the amount and forms of copper washed from the leaves provide essential information to optimise agrochemical efficacy while minimising the environmental impact. Abstract This study compares the rainfastness of nine forms of Cu, including nano and conventional Cu-based fungicide formulations, as well as their salt or bulk equivalents. Rainfastness is the ability to resist wash-off; it is a key property for improving pesticide formulations and for assessing the potential transfer of pesticides to the soil. A new protocol was developed to characterise losses of Cu from treated leaves \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17373727487246532529", "cites_id": ["17373727487246532529"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en18279", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sf_EhRnhG_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
