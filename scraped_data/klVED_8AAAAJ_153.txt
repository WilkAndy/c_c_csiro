Currently, our understanding of the fate and effects of C60 in the terrestrial environment is poor and is primarily hampered by the lack of reliable quantitative analytical methods. In this paper, we describe a method for effective extraction and sensitive detection of C60 residues in soils which will facilitate environmental fate studies on nC60. Abstract.Fullerenes (e.g. C60) are emerging as environmental contaminants due to their wide range of applications, such as in optics, electronics, cosmetics and biomedicine. Residue analysis is a crucial step in understanding the fate and effects of C60 in the terrestrial environments. However, there is a lack of reliable quantitative analytical methods for extraction and analysis of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18284088671287920198", "cites_id": ["18284088671287920198"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/EN09150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rkbc9cUhvv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
