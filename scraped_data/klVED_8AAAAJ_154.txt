The results from the biodegradation experiments showed that the six UV filters were degraded well in the aquifer materials under different redox conditions. Rapid biodegradation was observed for BP\u20103 and OMC in the aquifer materials, with their half\u2010lives of 1.5\u20108.8\u2009d and 1.3\u20105.2\u2009d, respectively. In most cases, aerobic conditions were more favorable for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7066091737175456470", "cites_id": ["7066091737175456470"], "pub_url": "https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gwmr.12027", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1nqqSP_MD2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 7}}
