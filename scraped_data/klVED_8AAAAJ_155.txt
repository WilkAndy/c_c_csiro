We examined the release behaviour of C60 from contaminated biosolids added to soils with varying physicochemical characteristics. Incubation studies were carried out in the dark for up to 24 weeks, by adding biosolids spiked (1.5 mg/kg) with three forms of C60 (suspended in water, in humic acid, and precipitated/particulate) to six contrasting soils. Leaching of different biosolids + soil systems showed that only small fractions of C60 (<5% of applied amount) were released, depending on incubation time and soil properties (particularly dissolved organic carbon content). Release of C60 from unamended soils was greater (at least twice as much) than from biosolids-amended soils.
