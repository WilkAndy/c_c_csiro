Sorption isotherms were found to be of the 'L' type according to the Giles classification with the data fitting well to the Langmuir equation. The sorption capacities of soils for diquat ranged from very high in clay soil (146 400 \u00b5mol kg-1) to very low in sand (1765 \u00b5mol kg-1) and followed the order of clay content in the soils. The clay soil also showed the highest value for the Langmuir coefficient representing bonding energy. The sorption capacities for the herbicides were less than the CEC of the soils. Both the type and content of clay minerals present in soil were important for sorption and subsequent desorption of the dipyridylium herbicides. An increase in the salt concentration of the soil solution (from 0.005 to 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6692665591090767430", "cites_id": ["6692665591090767430"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9930097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RuZxVeUf4VwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
