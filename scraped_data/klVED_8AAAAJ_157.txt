Adsorption of the herbicides decreased with increasing methanol content of the solution. An inverse log-linear relationship between the Freundlich adsorption coefficients for the two herbicides and the concentration of methanol was found. Adsorption of the herbicides in the presence of methanol followed the solvophobic theory, which describes the adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds in soils. Values of the Freundlich adsorption coefficient for aqueous solutions, of the two herbicides extrapolated from adsorption data for the methanol/water mixtures, showed close agreement with those obtained experimentally. Hence, adsorption in aqueous solutions for pesticides of low aqueous solubility can readily be predicted on this basis.
