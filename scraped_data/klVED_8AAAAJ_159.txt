Sorption coefficients (Log Kd) ranged from 0.13\u20131.28 for PFHxS, 0.17\u20131.06 for PFOA and 0.98\u20132.03 for PFOS, respectively, and bioaccumulation factors (Log BAFs) ranged from 0.29\u20131.24, 0.22\u20131.46 and 0.05\u20130.65 for PFHxS, PFOA and PFOS, respectively. Over the six-month period, Kd values significantly increased for PFHxS and PFOA but the magnitude of the increase was very small and did not translate into differences in plant PFAA-concentrations between aged and freshly spiked treatments. The Kd and BAF values were modelled by multiple linear regression (MLR) to soil physico-chemical properties and by partial least squares regression to soil spectra \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:YTuZlYwrTOUC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7683423849801377859", "cites_id": ["7683423849801377859"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420320550", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q-gsakgBoWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
