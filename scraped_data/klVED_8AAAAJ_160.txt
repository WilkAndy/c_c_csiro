Over the past three decades, women's issues have gained prominence on the international and national development agendas. It is more evident in India where the plight of poor and disenfranchised women have been central to the formulation of government policies. In contrast to policy deliberations and prevailing perception that the primary role of women is confined to that of domestic users of groundwater, the survey results of the study confirm that women also make substantial use of groundwater for productive purposes. The results confirm that a large number of women continue to travel many times a day to collect water for various uses. Women travelled an average of three times in a day for 50\u201377 min \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3830885330384188792", "cites_id": ["3830885330384188792"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352801X17300176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ePXNPOkJKjUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
