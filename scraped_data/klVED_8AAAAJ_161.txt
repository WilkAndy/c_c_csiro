In this study, four tracers commonly present in wastewater effluents were monitored to compare their relative effectiveness in determining areas in freshwater systems that are likely to be impacted by effluent discharges. The four tracers selected were the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine, anthropogenic gadolinium, fluorescent-dissolved organic matter (fDOM), and electrical conductivity (EC). The four tracers were monitored longitudinally in two distinct freshwater systems receiving wastewater effluents, where one site had a high level of effluent dilution (effluent <1 % of total flow) and the other site had a low level of effluent dilution (effluent \u223c50 % of total flow). At both sites, the selected tracers exhibited a similar pattern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8801921389163666155", "cites_id": ["8801921389163666155"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-013-3254-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:61oDbt60JnoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
