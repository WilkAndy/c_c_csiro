We have investigated the form in which nine pesticides (carbaryl, fenarimol, azinphos methyl, penconazole, pirimicarb, chlorpyrifos, propiconazole, procymidone and bupirimate) were transported in surface water from an apple and cherry orchard in the Mt. Lofty Ranges, South Australia, over three years. The majority of pesticides monitored were found to move off-site in the dissolved (<1.2\u03bcm) phase. Only propiconazole moved off-site predominantly (70\u201390%) by colloidal transport in association with particulate (>1.2\u03bcm) material. Chlorpyrifos was detected in surface drainage water for several months and the predominant phase in which it moved varied between events in a year and during an event \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5043852992970346601", "cites_id": ["5043852992970346601"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377411002964", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:adBJ2ZJd_0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
