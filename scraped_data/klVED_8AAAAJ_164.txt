The MIR technique has the advantage of being sensitive to both the content and the chemistry of soil organic matter and mineralogy, the important factors in the sorption of nonionic pesticides. MIR spectra and batch Kd values of atrazine were determined on a set of 31 soil samples as reference data for PLS calibration. The samples, with high variability in soil organic carbon content (SOC), were chosen from 10 southern Australian soil profiles (A1, A2, B, and C in one case). PLS calibrations, developed for the prediction of Kd from the MIR spectra and reference Kd data, were compared with predictions from Koc-based indirect estimation using SOC content. The reference Kd data for the 31 samples ranged from 0.31 to 5.48 L/kg, whereas Koc ranged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9161156040558649261", "cites_id": ["9161156040558649261"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf073152n", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rR9sieH2In8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
