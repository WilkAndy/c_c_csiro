We investigated the reactions of diazepam and oxazepam with free available chlorine using a high-resolution mass analyzer and theoretical calculation to elucidate the fate of benzodiazepines during water chlorination process. The obtained apparent second-order rate constants (kapp) for chlorine reaction with diazepam and oxazepam varied from 0.01 to 1.7\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121 and 0.7 to 31.6\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121 in the pH range of 5.5\u201310.0, respectively. Under typical wastewater disinfection conditions of neutral pH values, free chlorine concentrations of 5\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 and contact times of up to 2\u202fh, the corresponding half-lives for diazepam (\u223c180\u202fmin) and oxazepam (\u223c61\u202fmin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15112967096070821771", "cites_id": ["15112967096070821771"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894718315560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i9d3f4ALvNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 11, "2022": 8}}
