Using soil physical fractionation approach, sorption experiments were performed on whole soils and their aggregates. SOM chemistry was assessed by CP/MAS 13C NMR. The lower sorption observed in tropical soils was attributed to the greater blockage of SOM sorption sites than in subtropical soils. When these sites were exposed upon physical fractionation, sorption of the three herbicides in tropical soils increased, especially for imazethapyr. High amounts of poorly crystallized sesquioxides in these soils may have contributed to masking of sorption sites, indicating that organomineral interactions may lead to blockage of sorption sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12355130748201671478", "cites_id": ["12355130748201671478"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NhsRiPQ9dqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
