The tests were performed with aquifer sediment and wetland treated storm water under aerobic and anoxic geochemical conditions, with and without a carbon source amendment to assess the degradation of these herbicides. The aerobic conditions were suited for the relatively rapid degradation of the positive control 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol with a half\u2010life of 3.8\u20134.5 days and a much slower decay of simazine (30\u201332 days) and diuron (35\u201341 days). The study also showed that significant attenuation of simazine can be achieved through biodegradation under nitrate reducing conditions in aquifer sediments, with a similar half\u2010life (26\u201330 days) to the aerobic condition.
