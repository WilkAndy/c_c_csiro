Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was used to extract lipids from twelve soil horizons. Extractable lipids accounted for 3\u201313% of organic C. The organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (KOC) for diuron and phenanthrene were consistently higher for the lipid-extracted soils than for the whole soils (average of 31% for diuron and 29% for phenanthrene), indicating that lipids compete for or block sorption sites on the organic matter. Sorption experiments on one pair of HF-treated soils indicated that the blocking effects of minerals and lipids are independent, since lipid extraction and HF-treatment combined increased KOC by more than either treatment alone. Lipids extracted from whole and HF-treated soils were very similar in composition, consisting predominantly of long-chain polymethylene structures.
