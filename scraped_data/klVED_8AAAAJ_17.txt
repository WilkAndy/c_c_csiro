This laboratory study showed that all five EDCs were degraded in seawater within 56 days. However, a lag phase preceding their rapid degradation in seawater was observed for BPA, E2, and EE2. On the other hand, 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP dissipated rapidly due to abiotic as well as biotic factors without any lag phase. Under the aerobic conditions, the five EDCs were found to degrade in the sediment, with E2 and 4-n-NP showing fastest degradation, with estimated half-lives of 4.4 and 5.8 d, respectively, followed by BPA (t1/2 14.5 d), EE2 (t1/2 >20 d), and 4-t-OP (t1/2 >20 d).
