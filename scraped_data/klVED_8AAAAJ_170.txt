It has been documented that clearing natural vegetation and cropping soil typically decreases the original organic carbon (OC) content of soil. Because OC is one of the major parameters controlling pesticide sorption, the effects of land use on the sorption behaviour of fenamiphos and its 2 main metabolites, fenamiphos sulfone (f. sulfone) and fenamiphos sulfoxide (f. sulfoxide), together with fenarimol and azinphos methyl were investigated. Based on sorption isotherms for a subset of soils, using a range of concentrations (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mg/L), the use of a single concentration (2 mg/L) was considered adequate to determine sorption coefficients. Generally the Kd values for fenamiphos were significantly (P < 0.005) higher than those of its 2 metabolites. The sorption coefficients decreased in the order \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13125212772932913212", "cites_id": ["13125212772932913212"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR02094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PAgWBHofJrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
