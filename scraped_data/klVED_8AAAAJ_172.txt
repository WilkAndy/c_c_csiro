The ER transcripts were localised within the perinuclear region of the hepatocytes and were up-regulated with E2 exposure. A parallel induction of liver VTG transcripts and protein was observed within 24h, followed by a time-dependent increase in VTG protein. In the testis, both ERs were up-regulated in the germ and epithelial cells, while VTG protein was detected in the cellular space surrounding the spermatids and in association with the connective tissue of the sperm tubules. These results indicate that the ERs are positively auto-regulated in the liver and testis of male rainbowfish. The cellular localisation of VTG within the testis may suggest implication in the mediation of adverse effects of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6104667249505491006", "cites_id": ["6104667249505491006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720709000276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pli8_oQiuFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
