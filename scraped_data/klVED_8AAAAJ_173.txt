The sorption coefficient (Kd) values for carbaryl and ethion in soils did not follow the order of their organic carbon (OC) content, and specially their char content However, the Koc values in < 53 \u03bc m fractions after hydrofluoric acid/photo-oxidation with high energy (hydrofluoric acid/ultraviolet; HF/UV) treatment were found to be much higher than those in bulk untreated soils. The effect of organic matter chemistry was determined by correlating Koc values of contaminants in bulk soils or 53 \u03bc m fractions against sample aromaticity.
