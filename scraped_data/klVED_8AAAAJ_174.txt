Tropical soils are often highly weathered, richer in sesquioxides than temperate soils and may contain variable charge minerals. There are little data on sorption of PFASs in tropical soils. The highest Kd values were found for PFOS with mean values ranging from 0 to 31.6 L/kg. The Kd values for PFOA and PFHxS ranged from 0 to 4.9 L/kg and from 0 to 5.6 L/kg, respectively. While these values are in the range of literature sorption data, the average Kd values for PFOS and PFOA from the literature were 3.7 times and 3.6 times higher, respectively, than those measured in this study. Stepwise regression analysis did explain some of the variance, but with different explanatory variables for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:zwpXiJ37cpgC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3076058350760896182", "cites_id": ["3076058350760896182"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911935136X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tiZ6ucVasCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
