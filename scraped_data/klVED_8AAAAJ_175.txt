Survey responses to a detailed questionnaire by a cohort of students in both watersheds; school attendance records of year 8 class students (13\u201314 years old) and responses gathered via a socio-economic survey involving 500 families in the study area were used in the study. In both watersheds, >90% students identified groundwater scarcity as a major issue. Required to work at home or farm, about 65% students in Gujarat and 60% in Rajasthan missed school for up to 2 days/month; and a smaller proportion (\u223c 30%) missed schools for 4 or more days/month.
