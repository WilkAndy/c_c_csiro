Genetically modified (GM) and non-GM canola varieties released or being developed in Australia include Clearfield\u00ae (imidazolinone tolerant), TT (triazine tolerant), InVigor\u00ae (glufosinate-ammonium tolerant), Roundup Ready\u00ae - RR\u00ae (glyphosate tolerant) and Hyola\u00ae RT\u00ae (tolerant to both glyphosate and triazine). We used two risk assessment approaches \u2013 the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) and the Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) \u2013 to compare the environmental risks associated with herbicides used in the canola varieties (GM and non-GM) that are currently grown or may be grown in the future. Risk assessments found that from an environmental impact viewpoint a number of herbicides used in the production of TT canola showed high relative risk in terms of mobility and ecotoxicity of herbicides.
