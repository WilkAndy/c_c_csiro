However, significant levels of toxic Cr(VI) recently detected in surface water and groundwater in India, China, Australia, and elsewhere raise critical questions relating to current disposal criteria for Cr-containing wastes. It now appears that despite the thermodynamic stability of Cr(III), the presence of certain naturally occurring minerals, especially Mn oxides, can enhance oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the soil environment. This factor is of public concern because at high pH, Cr(VI) is bioavailable, and it is this form that is highly mobile and therefore poses the greatest risk of groundwater contamination.A review of the current literature indicates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 274, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16908254257556125096", "cites_id": ["16908254257556125096"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-21728-2_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qHWe2akvpuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 13, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 13, "2016": 21, "2017": 26, "2018": 23, "2019": 23, "2020": 31, "2021": 28, "2022": 34, "2023": 11}}
