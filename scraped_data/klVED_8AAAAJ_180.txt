Lofty Ranges provides a major source of drinking water for the city of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. In this study two major land uses (apples and cherries) in the Mt. Lofty Ranges were monitored for off-site transport of pesticides over approximately 30 months. While fungicides have been rarely reported in the literature to be present in surface water, in our studies several fungicides (fenarimol, bupirimate, penconazole, procymidone, propiconazole) were found to be transported off-site in a persistent manner over the study period. Two pesticides (chlorpyrifos and fenarimol) from the apple orchard were of particular concern. The average chlorpyrifos concentrations in 2007 and 2009 were more than ten times the environmental guideline value (0.01\u03bcg/L), suggesting potential deleterious effects on aquatic organisms immediately downstream of the apple orchard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7470518876086703475", "cites_id": ["7470518876086703475"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377411001351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c5X_WFadrGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
