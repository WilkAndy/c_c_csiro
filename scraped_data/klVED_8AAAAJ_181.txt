After consultation with growers a range of management strategies were tested to assess the effectiveness of various practices to minimise off-site movement of pesticides during irrigation. This paper reports on the effectiveness of the additions of high molecular weight, anionic, polyacrylamide (PAM) to irrigation water to minimise off-site movement of endosulfan, chlorothalonil, bupirimate, and atrazine. Water leaving from 4 separate irrigation bays, which consisted of 25 furrows per irrigation bay (Expt 1) or 39 furrows per irrigation bay (Expt 2), was monitored over time. The average concentration of endosulfan \u03b1 and \u03b2 and bupirimate leaving the irrigation bays for the duration of the single irrigation event was generally always less for the PAM-treated irrigation bays than the control \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4289841880056352651", "cites_id": ["4289841880056352651"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr05197", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i09aG3aUiDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
