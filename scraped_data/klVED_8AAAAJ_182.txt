These anthropogenic, hormonally active chemicals, known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can enter riverine systems through a variety of inputs, including urban and rural waste streams from households, industries and intensive farming activities. In Australia, treated effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can make a large contribution to the flows in rivers and creeks particularly during periods of low rainfall (ranging up to 100% of the flow in many locations).The main objective of the current study was (1) to quantify the load and accumulation of estrogenic and androgenic EDCs in riverine environments receiving tertiary-treated effluent discharges;(2) to establish how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4900380033793745268", "cites_id": ["4900380033793745268"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4900380033793745268&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dGGxaq2lAUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
