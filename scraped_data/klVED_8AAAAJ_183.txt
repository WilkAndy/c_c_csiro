Claims of superior efficacy, lower costs, improved sustainability etc. relative to conventional practices have been made. The promises, however, are not always fully substantiated, and thus may even prove counter-productive. Considering the shifts in drivers for the development of nano-enabled solutions, regulatory and public perception and to geographical discrepancies in terms food production, we reflect on how the proposed nano-enabled solutions are likely to meet the need in the global agricultural context. The potential of nanotechnology to reduce undernourishment and food insecurity at the global scale remains largely uncertain. Nanotechnology needs to align with the unique needs of emerging economies, where the scope of improvements are large but challenges abound \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13277429851274164615", "cites_id": ["13277429851274164615"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/en/d0en00271b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hzldVxroQrgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
