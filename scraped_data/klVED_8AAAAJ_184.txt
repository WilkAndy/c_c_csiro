After consultation with growers, a range of management strategies were tested to assess the effectiveness of various practices to minimise off-site movement of nutrients during irrigation. This paper reports on the effectiveness of the additions of high molecular weight, anionic, polyacrylamide (PAM) to irrigation water to minimise off-site movement of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and sediment. Surface runoff water quantity and quality from 4 separate irrigation bays, which contained 25 furrows per irrigation bay, was monitored over time for a single irrigation 35 days after sowing. Addition of PAM as a puck (cylindrical disc 55\u2009mm diameter by 23\u2009mm height) to the head of each irrigation furrow significantly (P < 0.001) decreased the average volume of surface runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1797545907270796043", "cites_id": ["1797545907270796043"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr05198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C0NVlnoq8hgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
