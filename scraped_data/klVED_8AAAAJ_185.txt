This study examined the mineralization of fullerenes with drastically different physicochemical properties (C60 and fullerol, C60-OH) in biosolid-amended soils. Using radiolabeled C60 and C60-OH, mineralization of <0.025% C60 and up to 3% C60-OH was observed in three contrasting soils after incubation for 55 days. This difference in observed mineralization highlights C60-OH\u2019s greater bioavailability compared to that of its parent compound C60 in biosolid-amended soils. Glucose-induced respiration tests on C60-/C60-OH-contaminated soils suggest that overall microbial activity was not compromised by exposure to these contaminant species. These results indicate that transformation of certain fullerenes, such as fullerol, could provide a pathway for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14232791200302435397", "cites_id": ["14232791200302435397"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RQxVKDAIhcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
