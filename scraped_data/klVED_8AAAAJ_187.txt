The effects of land use on the sorption behaviour of prometryne, atrazine, and its 2 main metabolites, deethylatrazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine (DIA), in sandy soils were studied. This study would provide fate data for these chemicals specifically for Australian soils. Sorption coefficients (Kd) were determined using batch studies and a single solution concentration (2 mg/L for atrazine, DEA, and DIA, and 3 mg/L for prometryne) after initially determining sorption isotherms for a subset of 6 soils for atrazine and prometryne using a range of concentrations. Generally, the Kd values for prometryne were significantly (P < 0.001) greater than for the other 3 compounds. There was no consistent trend in the Kd values for atrazine and the 2 metabolites. This study demonstrated that prometryne was least likely to pose a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3348013261776127772", "cites_id": ["3348013261776127772"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR02095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HId2s1KIdi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
