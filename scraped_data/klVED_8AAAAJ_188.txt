The method is based on solid phase extraction and HPLC with UV detection. In alkaline soils especially those containing low organic carbon it was possible to extract the herbicides with de\u2010ionised water and no clean up step was needed. Soil samples spiked with technical grade triasulfiiron, metsulfuron\u2010methyl and chlorsulfuron were extracted twice by shaking with de\u2010ionised water for one hour and centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 15 minutes. Supernatants filtered through glass micro\u2010fibre filters were passed through C18 cartridges previously pre\u2010conditioned with methanol and de\u2010ionised water at a flow rate of < 20 ml/min. Residues of the herbicides retained on the cartridge were eluted with acidified methanol. The eluate was analysed by HPLC.
