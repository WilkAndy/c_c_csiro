We investigated the occurrence and distribution of 16 PFASs from 2 classes of PFASs\u2014perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids\u2014in the archived surface sediments of five major rivers (Yellow River, Hai River, Liao River, Zhujiang River, and Dongjiang River) in northern and southern China. The study was also performed during the wet and dry seasons. Perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid were the most frequently detected (detection frequency = 100  and 63 %, respectively) in the sediments of the five rivers; the concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 0.99 ng/g dry weight (dw) and were lower than the limit of detection (<LOD), which is 3.89 ng/g dw for both.
