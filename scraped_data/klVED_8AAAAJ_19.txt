However, it is evident that trace levels of pesticide residues present in soil, water, air, and sometimes food, may result in harmful effects on human and environmental health. Pesticides can pose health risks through several exposure pathways including direct occupational related exposure, through food, or through the residues present in the environment. This paper reviews available information on the nature and extent of pesticide contamination of Australian soils, surface water, and groundwaters. Published studies on the fate and behaviour of pesticides in Australian soils have also been reviewed, covering the key processes controlling the fate and behaviour of pesticides in soils, namely sorption-desorption, degradation (biological and abiotic), and volatilisation in soil and their off-site transport into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 269, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18268778252689640339", "cites_id": ["18268778252689640339"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/s97109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k4vyVwe9h_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 14, "2006": 13, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 9, "2010": 11, "2011": 9, "2012": 18, "2013": 7, "2014": 16, "2015": 20, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
