Final report to Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation (CSIRO Land and Water Science Report Adelaide)", "abstract": "The variability of the influent quantity and quality of winery wastewater coupled with the intrinsic complexity of biological systems may prove challenging for operators that want to achieve cost-effective compliance. Operators need rapid and reliable quantitative indicators to tell them if their effluent falls within the allowable thresholds, and if not, to diagnose/optimise/troubleshoot the plant processes. A suite of key indicators pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen can be implemented at a low capital cost. The project team has assessed the winery wastewater quality based on these key indicators for different treatment processes. Such information is highly valuable in assessing the efficiency of different methods for removing organic loads. Additional measurements of organic load and biodegradation rates are more capital intensive, but they provide a more comprehensive picture of the process performance/compliance. There is a need for robust and rapid monitoring of different types of waste streams to identify possible sources of wastewater generation such as true beverage product versus lees, white product versus red product, grape juice versus wine and also individual components such as total sugar, total alcohol, tannins, proteins and solids. In this study, we evaluated the applicability in winery wastewater treatment of UV-VIS spectrometry as a rapid assessment method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1201792161186186851", "cites_id": ["1201792161186186851"], "pub_url": "https://www.wineaustralia.com/getmedia/5a9d9389-11c4-41f4-ade6-e754bf5fc7df/Systematic-management.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YwZabZqfrRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
