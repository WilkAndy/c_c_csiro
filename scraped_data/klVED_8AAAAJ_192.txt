However, runoff predominantly occurs in winter (late April\u2013October) since there is insufficient rain in the spring and summer period for runoff to occur. It is therefore important to establish the runoff potential of pesticide, despite the long contact time with soil. We studied the distribution of the loads transported during individual runoff events, and the proportion of total annual load transported in each event over three seasons. Some insecticides and fungicides (pirimicarb, procymidone, carbaryl, fenarimol and penconazole) transported off-site from and apple and cherry orchard over a period of 30 months showed a strong association between peak pesticide load and peak flow during individual flow events. Others (particularly chlorpyrifos \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4668198742346009543", "cites_id": ["4668198742346009543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377411001697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x4t14gXGyEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
