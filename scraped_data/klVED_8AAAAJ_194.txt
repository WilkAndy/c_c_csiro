This paper reports on the effectiveness of incorporation of pesticides by cultivator or power harrows before irrigating, and spraying pesticides only onto beds to minimise off\u2010site transport. Incorporation of pesticides by power harrows prior to irrigation was found to be more effective in decreasing the off\u2010site transport of a more strongly sorbed pesticide, endosulfan. The average load of total endosulfan (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + sulfate) decreased by 74% (P < 0.01) from 11.41 g ha\u22121 from the conventionally treated bays to 2.96 g ha\u22121 from the incorporated irrigation bays. The total average load of atrazine leaving the irrigation bays was decreased by 81% (P < 0.05) from 87.82 g ha\u22121 under the conventional practice of spraying the whole field to 16.95 g ha\u22121 by spraying the beds only.
