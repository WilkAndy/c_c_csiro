This difficulty is exacerbated for compounds susceptible to degradation, which also decreases the solution concentration. The objective of this study was to determine sorption of hydrophilic pesticides by applying an unsaturated transient flow method, which enables determination of sorption at sufficiently small solution to soil ratios. The method makes use of piston\u2010like displacement of the antecedent solution in equilibrium with sorbed phase when pesticide\u2010free water is infiltrated into a soil column spiked with a pesticide. Pesticide sorption and the solution concentration are inferred from a plot of total pesticide content per unit mass of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12209728211570324591", "cites_id": ["12209728211570324591"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2003.0423", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b_S2Vh6rcakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
