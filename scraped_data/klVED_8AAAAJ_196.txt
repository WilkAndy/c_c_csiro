To date, most studies have focused on assessing soil\u2013water partitioning behavior of PFASs and the key factors that can affect their sorption, whereas PFASs leaching from contaminated soils have not yet been widely investigated. This study evaluated the leaching and desorption of a wide range of PFASs from twelve contaminated soils using the Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP), the U.S. EPA Multiple Extraction Procedure (MEP), and Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF). All three leaching tests provided a similar assessment of PFAS leaching behavior. Leaching of PFASs from soils was related to C-chain lengths and their functional head groups. While short-chain (CF2 \u2264 6) PFASs were easily \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:OzeSX8-yOCQC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8074628325044939872", "cites_id": ["8074628325044939872"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.1c06604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YGycL67XDnAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 9}}
