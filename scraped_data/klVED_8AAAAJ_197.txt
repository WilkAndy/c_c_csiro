The goal of this perspective is to highlight the key issues that face future leaders in crop protection, based on presentations made during a symposium titled \u201cDeveloping Global Leaders for Research, Regulation and Stewardship of Crop Protection Chemistry in the 21st Century\u201d, held in conjunction with the IUPAC 13th International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry in San Francisco, CA, USA, during August 2014. The presentations highlighted the fact that leaders in crop protection must have a good basic scientific training and understand new and evolving technologies, are aware of the needs of both developed and developing countries, and have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1654814503490128618", "cites_id": ["1654814503490128618"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf5060744", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6oqx-QUV9xYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
