In the present study, soil samples were collected over 4 mo from a field trial following addition of biosolids. The recombinant yeast estrogen screen bioassay identified estrogenic activity in the soil at all sampling times to concentrations up to 2.3\u2009\u00b5g 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol equivalency/kg. The present results indicate the potential for estrogenic compounds to persist in soil following biosolids application.
