However, no coherent theory exists to scale the data from the plot and paddock scales to that of catchment scale for water quality. Here we develop a theoretical basis for that scaling. This is a complex problem as pesticides will usually be applied to different paddocks at different times, and there can be numerous paddocks in a catchment. The mass of pesticide in the topsoil for a periodical applied pesticide was described at the paddock scale as a pulse input with first-order kinetic decay. At the catchment scale, a summation of pulse inputs during an application window is shown to converge to a convolution integral. From the convolution solution, the residual mass, mean mass and maximum mass of pesticide can be determined. Results show that (1) maximum mass is reduced at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17426179160733299869", "cites_id": ["17426179160733299869"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788091100288X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nbTSa5451vEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
