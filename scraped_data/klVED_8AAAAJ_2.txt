In this paper, we briefly review the current knowledge on the fate of these steroids in the environment. Natural estrogenic steroids estrone (E1), 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and estriol (E3) all have a solubility of approximately 13 mg/l, whereas synthetic steroids 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2) and mestranol (MeEE2) have a solubility of 4.8 and 0.3 mg/l, respectively. These steroids have a moderate binding on sediments and are reported to degrade rapidly in soil and water. Estrogenic steroids have been detected in effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in different countries at concentrations ranging up to 70 ng/l for E1, 64 ng/l for E2, 18 ng/l for E3 and 42 ng/l for EE2. E2 concentrations in river waters from Japan, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands ranged up to 27 ng/l. In addition, E2 concentrations ranging from 6 to 66 ng/l \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1046, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14124719273710719444", "cites_id": ["14124719273710719444"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412002000752", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1BGk7VcVBcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 9, "2004": 20, "2005": 32, "2006": 40, "2007": 45, "2008": 39, "2009": 57, "2010": 55, "2011": 68, "2012": 72, "2013": 69, "2014": 95, "2015": 65, "2016": 58, "2017": 68, "2018": 54, "2019": 60, "2020": 51, "2021": 46, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
