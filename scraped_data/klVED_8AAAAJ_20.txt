BT, 5-TTri and BP-3 were found as the dominant compounds detected in the wastewater samples with average concentrations up to 5706 \u00b1 928 ng/L, 6758 \u00b1 1438 ng/L and 2086 \u00b1 1027 ng/L in influent, and up to 2439 \u00b1 233 ng/L, 610 \u00b1 237 ng/L and 153 \u00b1 121 ng/L in effluent, respectively. In the biosolid, 4-MBC and OC were found with the highest concentrations of 962 \u00b1 135 ng/g and 465 \u00b1 65 ng/g \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2664388999629452954", "cites_id": ["2664388999629452954"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911100577X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mjZfuq3P-SQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 26, "2014": 26, "2015": 23, "2016": 27, "2017": 24, "2018": 25, "2019": 25, "2020": 24, "2021": 19, "2022": 26, "2023": 15}}
