The aim was to determine if spiking experiments accurately predict the degradation of compounds in biosolids-amended soils using two different types of biosolids, a centrifuge dried biosolids (CDB) and a lagoon dried biosolids (LDB). The rate of degradation of the compounds was examined and the results indicated that there were considerable differences between the indigenous and spiked compounds. These differences were more marked for BPA, for which the indigenous compound was detectable throughout the study, whereas the spiked compound decreased to below the detection limit prior to the study completion. The rate of degradation for the indigenous BPA was approximately 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17984267299163980783", "cites_id": ["17984267299163980783"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971201621X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:78NX6NLzlPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
