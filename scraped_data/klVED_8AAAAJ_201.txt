Non-estrogens included the non-ionic surfactant breakdown compounds nonyl phenol mono- and di-ethoxylates, 4-t-octylphenol and 4-nonyl phenol; and, the plasticizer bisphenol A. Estrogens included 17\u03b2-estradiol; estrone; and, 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol. Effluent from Bolivar WWTP is polished using stabilisation lagoons followed by coagulation, dissolved air flotation/filtration and chlorination for non-potable reuse. Biosolids from both plants is applied to agricultural land as a soil conditioner. Non-estrogen indicator EDCs were detected at the highest concentration in sewage, effluent and sludge but estrogen indicator EDCs contributed the greatest potential for estrogenicity. The fate of indicator EDCs at various treatment stages is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2081517344476331027", "cites_id": ["2081517344476331027"], "pub_url": "https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-abstract/62/6/1416/14354", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E3xTF_8I4xwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
