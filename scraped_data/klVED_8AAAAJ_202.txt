Two separate batch studies were conducted. In the first, the rates of loss of E2 and EE2 were determined at time intervals of 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 56 d after initial spiking of soil with each estrogen at 1mgkg\u22121 and the antimicrobials at 10 and 100mgkg\u22121. Little loss of E2 and EE2 (<15%) under sterile conditions was noted compared to rapid loss in non-sterile soil (>60% in 24h). There were no measurable effects on estrogen degradation by the two antimicrobials at spiked concentrations up to 100mgkg\u22121. The experiments were repeated to study degradation rates of the estrogens within the first 24h (0, 3, 8, 24h), 3 d and then weekly to 56 d. Again, E2 and EE2 degradation was not significantly affected by the presence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=436602738356636662", "cites_id": ["436602738356636662"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653509010789", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9su1l-AfDwYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 2}}
