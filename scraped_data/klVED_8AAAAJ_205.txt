Measured and literature chronic toxicity data for PFOS to 11 benthic estuarine/marine species were used in a species sensitivity distribution yielding 99% and 95% species protection concentrations of 6 and 25 \u03bcg PFOS/L respectively. The lowest dissolved PFOS concentrations causing toxicity were 0.28 mg/L (LOEC) to 28-day bivalve growth, 0.49 mg/L to survival and growth of juvenile amphipods, and 1.2 and 0.9 (0.7\u20131.6) mg/L as a LOEC and EC10 values for 10-day amphipod reproduction, respectively. A strong relationship (Kd) existed for PFOS-partitioning between sediment and overlying water concentrations and organic carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15850030277848025154", "cites_id": ["15850030277848025154"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721010755", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QkhRho-e9tsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
