Particularly, the effect of exogenous organic carbon substrate (sucrose) loading on the performance of NTFs is not well understood. A laboratory-scale NTF system was operated in recirculation mode, with the objective of removing ammonia and CoC simultaneously. The efficiency of a high rate NTF for removal both of low concentration of ammonia (5 mg NH4\u2013N L\u22121) and different concentrations of CoC in the presence of an exogenous organic carbon substrate (30 mg total organic carbon (TOC) L\u22121) was investigated. In the presence of exogenous organic carbon, the results demonstrated that the high rate NTF was able to successfully remove most of the CoCs investigated, with the removal ranging from 20.2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13799630292366366100", "cites_id": ["13799630292366366100"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479716300913", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lJU3KKMigr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
