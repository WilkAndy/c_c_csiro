In 2007, a total of 2.4 million tons of  active pesticide ingredients were applied globally at a cost of 39 billion $US (Grube et al,  2011) (Figure 23.1). The pest control market  is predicted to grow to 52 billion $US in 2019,  with countries in South America and the  Asian-Pacifi c anticipated to greatly increase  their share of the global market (Ceresana,  2012). According to data collected by the  USEPA for pesticide use in the US in 2007,  the agricultural sector was responsible for 63  per cent of total pest control products used,  with homes, gardens, industry, commercial  and government sectors making up the  remainder (Grube et al, 2011).
