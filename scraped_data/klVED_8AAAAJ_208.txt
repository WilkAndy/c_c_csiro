The membranes and housing of commonly used syringe microfilters are made of synthetic polymers which can potentially react, and hence may be incompatible, with some pesticides. For example polyethylene has been reported to sorb atrazine (Xing et al. 1996) and poly (isobutyl methacrylate) to sorb phenanthrene (Leboeuf and Weber 1997). While sorption of pesticides from aqueous solution onto the materials used for flasks and tubes has been fairly well documented (Topp and Smith 1992), little attention has been given to filters. General guidelines regarding membranes and filter housing are provided by the manufacturers. However, there are generally no specifications available for their suitability for use with pesticides.
