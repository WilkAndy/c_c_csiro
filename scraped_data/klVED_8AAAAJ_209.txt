This paper briefly reviews the reactions of these materials in soil, and the processes involved in their transport by water over and through soils in the field. The natural heterogeneity of soils, and fluctuations in the source strength of pesticides and nutrients due to biophysical factors and environmental conditions, have a profound effect on measurements. Preferred techniques are discussed for measuring losses from drained systems (sampled as point sources, which provide an integration of spatial and temporal variability in the areas drained) and undrained systems (sampled as diffuse sources, where the reliability of areal averaging depends on the efficiency of the sampling strategy).
