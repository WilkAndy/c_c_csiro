We also characterized the biotransformation of E2 to E1 in the loam soil under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Sorption test using a batch equilibrium method demonstrated that alkylphenols (4\u2010t\u2010OP and 4\u2010n\u2010NP) had the strongest sorption onto soils, followed by estrogens (EE2, E2, E1, E3) and BPA. This laboratory study showed that all five EDCs, including the degradation product E1, were degraded rapidly in the soil within 7 d under aerobic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9480545525108396159", "cites_id": ["9480545525108396159"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/05-074R.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f1ABzeypkYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2009": 25, "2010": 19, "2011": 15, "2012": 20, "2013": 26, "2014": 15, "2015": 19, "2016": 17, "2017": 24, "2018": 11, "2019": 19, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
