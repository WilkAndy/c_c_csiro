The sorption of nC60 particles was studied in a range of solvent mixtures by changing volume fractions of ethanol from 20 to 100 percent. Sorption and particle characteristics were found to be very different in ethanol\u2006:\u2006water mixtures above and below 60% ethanol. In the range of 20\u201360% ethanol, sorption increased from 1.2 to 14.6 L kg\u22121 accompanied by a change in zeta (\u03b6) potential from \u221232.4 to \u22127.2 mV. This observation can be attributed to hydrophilic interactions that negatively charged nC60 particles undergo with soil colloids and water molecules. From 60% to 100% ethanol volume fractions, hydrophobic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2817107355563466904", "cites_id": ["2817107355563466904"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/em/c0em00689k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mCCA1jZgGCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
