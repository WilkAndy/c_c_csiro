The organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (KOC) for diuron and phenanthrene (determined from single initial concentrations of 0.8mgL\u22121 and 1.5mgL\u22121, respectively) were consistently higher following solvent-conditioning of a whole soil with five organic solvents (acetonitrile, acetone, methanol, chloroform and dichloromethane). The relative increase in KOC was inversely related to the polarity of the conditioning solvent (i.e. greater increases in KOC were observed for the least polar solvents: chloroform and dichloromethane). The effect of solvent-conditioning on the sorption properties of the same soil that had been lipid-extracted using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) was also investigated. Since lipid extraction involves treatment with a non-polar solvent (95:5 dichloromethane:methanol) one may have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8460985830466760397", "cites_id": ["8460985830466760397"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653509004858", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:za6V2sh1a3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
