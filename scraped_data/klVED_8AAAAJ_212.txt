Risk indicators are regarded as useful tools in minimizing off-site impacts of pesticides and can assist in decision-making and policy formulation. While several theoretically attractive models are available, their use is limited due to the lack of availability of input data and local variablity. In contrast, pesticide risk indicators which are not data hungry, are becoming popular, especially to integrate several aspects of concern associated with pesticide use. This chapter provides an overview of available pesticide risk indicators as tools for risk assessment and decision-making for risk management covering both groundwater and surfacewater.
