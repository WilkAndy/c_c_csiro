The GIS version of PIRI (PIRI-GIS) was used to assess the impact of pre-planting atrazine use in the pine plantations on the Gnangara Mound, Western Australia. The impact on groundwater was found to be spatially variable, mainly dependent on soil type and depth to groundwater, because land use variables were spatially constant. Areas with the greatest impact on groundwater were those where the soil had a low sorption capacity for atrazine. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of the sorption coefficient based on organic carbon (K oc) for atrazine was found to significantly improve the results from PIRI-GIS. Average values for K oc (i.e. based on overseas data) were too low for most of the local \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4620984791649709309", "cites_id": ["4620984791649709309"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11267-005-7398-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_WzDWi8JIUAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
