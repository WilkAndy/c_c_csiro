Monte Carlo techniques were also used to implement a sensitivity analysis of LEACHP to determine influential parameters. As an extension to the sensitivity analysis, a model comparison was performed with similar models, in order to quantify differences arising from the use of different models. The Monte Carlo risk assessment involved simultaneous variation of LEACHP's soil parameters and selected chemical parameters to assess the risk of atrazine leaching past the root-zone at the experimental site. This Monte Carlo risk assessment predicted that of the 100 mg/m2 of atrazine applied at the experimental site, the mean cumulative mass per unit area of atrazine to leach below the root-zone after 263 days was 49 mg/m2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17007216475311666737", "cites_id": ["17007216475311666737"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR01043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MXYftUbFBewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
