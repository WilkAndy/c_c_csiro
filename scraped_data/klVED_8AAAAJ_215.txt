As part of a long\u2010term effort to develop a native fish model organism for assessment of endocrine disruption in Australia's largest watershed, the Murray\u2010Darling River Basin, the present study evaluated endocrine disruption in adult males of the native Australian Murray rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis) exposed to effluent from an activated sludge WWTP and water from the Murray River during a 28\u2010d, continuous\u2010flow, on\u2010site experiment. Analysis of the WWTP effluent and river water detected estrone and 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol at concentrations up to approximately 25\u2009ng\u2009L\u22121. Anti\u2010estrogenicity of effluent samples was detected in vitro using yeast\u2010based bioassays (yeast estrogen screen) throughout the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3893120544395504898", "cites_id": ["3893120544395504898"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.2895", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ai14LIIkBzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
