Specifically, water quality targets have been set for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), sediment and particulate nutrients, and pesticides (1). The pesticide target considers five priority photosystem II inhibitor herbicides (ametryn, atrazine, diuron, hexazinone, tebuthiuron). However, at least 49 pesticides have been detected in the GBR catchments and lagoon (3). River load contributions of these so-called alternate pesticides can increase the total pesticide load by up to 28%, depending on the pesticide and the catchment under consideration (3). This is of concern as recent research suggests that neonicotinoids, glyphosate and other prevalent alternate pesticides pose potential ecological risks which are poorly understood in the GBR context.In addition to alternate pesticides, other contaminants are known to be present in the GBR and the Torres Strait (TS). This includes contaminants such as metals, hydrocarbons, coal particles, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, antifouling paints and marine debris (4). While these so-called emerging contaminants2 are a topic of intensive research internationally, little is known about their potential risk to the GBR and TS marine ecosystems, especially compared to the risk identified for the current pollutants of concern.
