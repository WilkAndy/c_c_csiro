In this chapter we provide an overview of sorption and its dependence on soil properties. Soil solid phase consists of mineral and organic matter; both in strong association with each other make a contribution towards sorption of pesticides, depending on their relative abundance in soil/sediments, chemistry and the chemical nature of the pesticide molecule. We discuss the roles of organic matter and clay contents as well their chemistries in determining sorption of pesticides, and assess the partition theory in terms of its adequacy in describing the observed sorption behavior of pesticides in soil. The complex interactions and heterogeneities associated with the soil solid phase contribute to the large degree of variation in Koc , a parameter that is often used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2701304282870335859", "cites_id": ["2701304282870335859"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2014-1174.ch012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c0m64u71fCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
