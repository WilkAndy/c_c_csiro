The quantification of genes involved in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen was used to assess potential impacts on ecosystem functions. The effects of disturbance on bacterial community structure were assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes, and clone library analysis was used to phylogenetically characterize significant shifts. Significant (P < 0.05) shifts in bacterial community structures were associated with alteration of the sediment's physicochemical properties, particularly nutrient loading from the WWTP discharge. The effects were greatest at the sampling location 400 m downstream of the outfall where the stream flow is reduced. This highly affected stretch of sediment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3690677939589375425", "cites_id": ["3690677939589375425"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.02348-07", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wWWYMQjsNzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 14, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 16, "2015": 23, "2016": 24, "2017": 15, "2018": 24, "2019": 26, "2020": 31, "2021": 20, "2022": 25, "2023": 9}}
