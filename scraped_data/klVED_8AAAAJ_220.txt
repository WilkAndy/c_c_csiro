What is less clear is its ability to remove emerging organic contaminants. This study evaluated the potential of NTF to remove eight trace organic chemicals of concern (CoCs), with initial concentration of caffeine, bisphenol A, benzotriazole, trimethoprim and acetaminophen 1 mg L\u22121, atrazine 2 mg L\u22121, 17\u03b1\u2010ethynylestradiol 5 mg L\u22121 and N, N\u2010diethyl\u2010m\u2010toluamide 10 mg L\u22121, using a laboratory\u2010scale NTF system. The impact of initial nitrification rate on chemicals' removal and the impact of chemicals on nitrification rate were investigated.The removal efficiency of a recirculating NTF for CoC removal was in the following order: caffeine (98%) > acetaminophen and N, N\u2010diethyl\u2010m\u2010toluamide (58.6%) > atrazine (48.7%) > 17\u03b1\u2010ethynylestradiol (48.3%) > benzotriazole (42.8%) > \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1962224251927431362", "cites_id": ["1962224251927431362"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jctb.4938", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wojKkY84OxsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
