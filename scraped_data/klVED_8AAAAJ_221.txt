The aim of the pathogen research was to determine specific decay rates for individual microorganisms and the major environmental factors driving any decay (or reducing decay). The research on the organic chemicals aimed to determine the impact of biodegradation and photolysis degradation on selected organic chemicals.At the same time as this Alliance funded research was being conducted, Seqwater and Griffith University had been undertaking work on improving the ability to identify the sources of faecal contamination in the reservoirs using Microbial Source Tracking (MST). It was agreed that, with additional funding through the Alliance, the information from this research would be an important link to the research on pathogen decay and chemical degradation. It was also proposed that this combined research could be potentially incorporated into existing or new Seqwater hydrodynamic models used to predict water flow and conditions in the reservoirs. The ultimate objective of this combined research program was to determine if reservoirs could have a role as an active treatment barrier and if the \u201chealth\u201d of the reservoirs could be used as an indicator of its effectiveness in removing biological and chemical contaminants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4698749747344291074", "cites_id": ["4698749747344291074"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melody-Christie/publication/276068562_A_combination_of_PhP_typing_and_b-D-glucuronidase_gene_sequence_variation_analysis_for_differentiation_of_Escherichia_coli_from_humans_and_animals/links/563198a608ae0530378d30fe/A-combination-of-PhP-typing-and-b-D-glucuronidase-gene-sequence-variation-analysis-for-differentiation-of-Escherichia-coli-from-humans-and-animals.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ArXpCgBQNUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
