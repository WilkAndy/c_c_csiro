This study was conducted to determine the concentrations of nutrients and sediments in surface waters contributing to Laguna de Bay, Philippines. Four sites representing various land uses and non-point and point sources of contamination (rice, vegetable and coconut production systems, and piggery) were selected and instrumented with automated water samplers for time weighted collection of water samples. Total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP) and total carbon (TC) were determined in unfiltered samples. The effluent from piggery farms (a point source) had the highest TSS, TKN, TP and TC concentrations. For the other three sites, the dominant land use upstream of the sampling sites greatly influenced the concentrations of nutrients and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18251843628146987562", "cites_id": ["18251843628146987562"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377411001685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KpKtzxOTS_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
