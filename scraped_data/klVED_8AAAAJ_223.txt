Among the seven elements analysed (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn), Zn concentrations were the highest, followed by Pb, Cu and Cr in the sediments of SOP. Significantly higher concentrations (p < 0.05) of DDTs were found in sediments of the Homebush Bay and Parramatta River sites compared with the urban reference sites, mainly due to past manufacturing of DDT in the Homebush Bay area. However, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in concentrations were found for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as well as DDTs between sediments from SOP and the urban reference sites.
