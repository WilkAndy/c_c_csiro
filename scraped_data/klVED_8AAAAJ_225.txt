The resulting software, ASRRI (ASR Risk Index), uses published information on sorption and biodegradation or inactivation to predict attenuation of a range of inorganic and organic substances and micro-organisms that may potentially be present in injectant between the time of injection and recovery from the same or different wells. The principles are described and examples are shown to demonstrate the types of inputs required and results produced. ASRRI is intended for use as a screening tool for proponents and regulators of ASR systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7232111057456231983", "cites_id": ["7232111057456231983"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003078838-15/asrri-predictive-index-contaminant-attenuation-aquifer-storage-recovery-miller-correll-dillon-kookana", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L3bae7CeXWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
