In this study, the partitioning behavior of (14C)-C60 aged up to 12 weeks was investigated in biosolids-amended soil. Spiked samples were subjected to sequential partitioning using water, methanol, and toluene followed by total combustion of solids; the distribution of 14C across solvents and matrices were used to provide insights on C60 behavior. In most samples, 14C only partitioned in toluene with the remaining (non-extractable) activity detected in the solid phase. In all biosolids-amended soil samples, an increase in non-extractable 14C were observed for those exposed to light (vs dark) with the greatest difference observed in biosolids + sand samples. Possible processes that contribute to the observed 14C distribution, i.e. retention and potential transformation of C60, were discussed. Over-all, results suggest that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17992751185366433979", "cites_id": ["17992751185366433979"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116307199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u0DBl98Xs_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
