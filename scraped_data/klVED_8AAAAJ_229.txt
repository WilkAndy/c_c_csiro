Strychnine disappeared rapidly in non-sterile (biologically active) Bute and Booleroo soils, from an initial concentration of 50mgkg\u22121 soil to less than 1mgkg\u22121 within 42d. Strychnine was not degraded in sterilised Booleroo soil, suggesting that microbiological processes were responsible for the degradation of strychnine in these two alkaline soils. Degradation of strychnine in both soils was modelled using a logistic regression model, and was characterised by an 8\u201314d \u201clag phase\u201d followed by rapid strychnine disappearance. In contrast strychnine degradation was not observed both in the non-sterile and sterilised Mintaro soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10619863996190068255", "cites_id": ["10619863996190068255"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071797001090", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H47evwlWYZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
