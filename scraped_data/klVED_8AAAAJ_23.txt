Standard batch sorption\u2013desorption experiments were conducted on soil samples freshly amended with two biochars, (namely, poultry litter \u2013 PL and paper mill \u2013 PM sludge) as well on those collected from field 32months after biochar application. Soils that were freshly amended with biochars @ 10tha\u22121 showed a two (PM) to five (PL) fold increase in sorption of herbicides as compared with that in the unamended soil. For example, the fresh amendments with PL biochar at 10tha\u22121 led to a highly significant (P<0.001) increase in the Freundlich sorption coefficient (Kf) of atrazine; i.e. 20.71 (n=0.40) as compared with 4.02 (n=0.70) for the control soil.
