Wheat grains were coated with a mixture (containing strychnine, sugar, flour, oil, and a dye) at a rate of 3 g strychnine/kg grain, and were spread as a bait for mice at a density of approximately 3 treated grains/m2. We examined the release of strychnine residue from the treated grains into soils and its sorption\u2013desorption behaviour in 4 different South Australian soils, ranging from sand to clay in texture and acidic to alkaline in reaction. Release studies using treated grains showed that, unless the treated grains were buried in soil, the release of strychnine from the treated grain into soil was slow, requiring about 2 months for its complete transfer into soil. However, upon burial of the treated grain, such as during resowing, the transfer of strychnine from the treated grain to soil was rapid (>90% within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9769322514229199495", "cites_id": ["9769322514229199495"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/S96070", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h4LbDBGbk4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
