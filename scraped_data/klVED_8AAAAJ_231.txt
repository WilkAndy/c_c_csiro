While improvement in nutrient delivery and the ability to adsorb environmental contaminants have been demonstrated, what happens to GNMs in soil is a question that has not been addressed. The main aim of this study was to investigate their degradation in soil to have a better understanding of their environmental fate. Using radioisotope techniques, this study assessed the potential mineralisation and release of graphene oxide (GO), one of the most commonly used forms of graphene. Results revealed that the conversion of GO to carbon dioxide was negligible (<2%) in microbially-active soils. GO remaining in soil was also not readily released by water extractions. The lack of mineralisation and release is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13206560391732506474", "cites_id": ["13206560391732506474"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653519317825", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aq_1dbQgR7cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
