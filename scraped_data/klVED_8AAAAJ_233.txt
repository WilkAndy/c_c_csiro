Its cation exchange capacity was 100 cmol/kg. The analytical grade fenamiphos (96.4% purity) was obtained \ufb01om the Sigma Chemicals. The chloride or bromide salts of phenyltrimethylarmnonium-(PTMA), hexadecyltrimethylarmnonium (I-IDTMA) and benzylsterilateditnethylammonium (BSDMA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia. Solvents and other reagents used were of analytical grade.In the present study we have used the K-montmorillonite clay as standard natural clay. K-montmorillonite was prepared by replacing the sodium in Namontmorillonite clay by potassium. Therefore, Na-montmorillonite clay (2 u \ufb01action) was equilibrated with 1M KC] solution for 24h. Alter equilibration clay suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and clay pellet was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16707889962184033011", "cites_id": ["16707889962184033011"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00128-003-8944-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:80JL_mVZ3ucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
