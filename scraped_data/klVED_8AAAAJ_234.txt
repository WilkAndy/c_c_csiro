Incorporation of the surfactants into soils enhanced the release of both pesticides to various extents, which could be related to the type of pesticides and type and the amount of surfactants added. Release of ethion was dramatically enhanced by aqueous concentrations of surfactants above their critical micelle concentration values. This was attributed to solubility enhancement through incorporation of the highly hydrophobic compound within surfactant micelles. A concentration of 10 g L\u22121 of various surfactants released >70% of the total ethion from the soil irrespective of the surfactant. For carbaryl, the surfactants were effective at low concentrations and dependence on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13678632040777681442", "cites_id": ["13678632040777681442"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/PFC-200026789", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IorUW15D1L0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
