Proceedings of the 2000 Contaminated Site Remediation Conference, Melbourne, Australia", "pages": "283-290", "abstract": "Contaminated site remediation is often established on the basis of risk assessments that rely on both ecotoxicity and oral toxicity of contaminants of concern. The success of bioremediation, contaminated site rehabilitation and production of contaminantfree food is largely dependent on the bioavailability of the contaminants in the terrestrial environment. Currently, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) of toxic substances is seen as an attractive remediation option. In addition to natural attenuation processes, one assumption in MNA is that contaminant bioavailability in soils decreases with time (ie with ageing). Consequently bioavailability is used as the key indicator of potential risk that contaminants pose to both environmental and human health. However, the definition of'bioavailability'and the concept on which it is based are unclear, the methods adopted vary throughout the world and, therefore, there is no single standard technique for the assessment of either plant availability of contaminants or their ecotoxicological impacts on soil biota. In this paper we define bioavailability as the fraction of the total contaminant in the interstitial water and soil particles that is available to receptor organisms with the extent of bioavailable fraction varying with time, the nature of soil types, organisms and environmental factors. Both bioindicators and geoindicators of bioavailable contaminant fractions are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4272692072654427970", "cites_id": ["4272692072654427970"], "pub_url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA387985.pdf#page=297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qtcxac2mSzsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2}}
