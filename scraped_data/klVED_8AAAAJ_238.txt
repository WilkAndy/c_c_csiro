A review is also given of alternative mathematical models for predicting the movement of these chemicals under a given set of experimental conditions. While predictive models provide important tools in both research and management, comprehensive field data sets on pesticide transport and volatilization remain needed to accurately assess and improve the performance of these models. Improved technologies for measuring pesticide transport and degradation processes in heterogeneous field soil are also needed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11841850367150163121", "cites_id": ["11841850367150163121"], "pub_url": "https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:prj&volume=4&issue=1&article=001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sYRQCSu0VqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
