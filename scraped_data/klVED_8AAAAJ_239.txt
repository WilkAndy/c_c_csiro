At PFAS contaminated sites, the unsaturated soil horizon often serves as a long-term source for sustained PFAS contamination for both groundwater and surface water runoff. An understanding of the processes controlling future mass loading rates to the saturated zone from these source zones is imperative to design efficient remediation measures. In the present study, hydrochemical data from a site where PFAS transport was observed as a result of the decades-long application of AFFF were used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models that determine PFAS mobility across the vadose zone under realistic field-scale conditions. The simulation results demonstrate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11159702088065767676", "cites_id": ["11159702088065767676"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135422010429", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_FhYJuw535oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 7}}
