We investigated the degradation behaviour of three insecticides (bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid) at termiticidal application rates under standard laboratory conditions (25\u2009\u00b0C, 60% field moisture capacity and darkness) for 24 months. The study was carried out on one soil and two bedding materials (sand\u2010dolomite and quarry sand), which are commonly used under housing in Australia. Experiments were also conducted to examine the effect of soil moisture on the degradation of these insecticides. Insecticide residues in the samples collected at different days after application were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The rate of degradation of bifenthrin and imidacloprid insecticides was adequately described by a first\u2010order kinetic model (r2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4941528008553967882", "cites_id": ["4941528008553967882"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9063(199912)55:12%3C1222::AID-PS83%3E3.0.CO;2-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CrGA3YrVk0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 8, "2007": 13, "2008": 15, "2009": 12, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 14, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 15, "2017": 13, "2018": 14, "2019": 17, "2020": 13, "2021": 8, "2022": 8}}
