In this overview we explore the potential application of biochar and hydro-char as low-cost sorbents for the removal of a range of contaminants, including organic chemicals, nutrients, metals and organic contaminants from water.  Due to their high specific surface area, microporous nature and active surface chemistry, chars have been found to be effective in removing a range of contaminants from water and soil. It has been shown that some biochars exhibit comparable sorption capacity for organic compounds and metals to commercially available activated carbons. However, high variability in sorption has been observed, resulting from differences in the properties of chars, which result from variations in biomass used and the specific production conditions.
