Comparison of degradation rates of selected pharmaceuticals among different aqueous media under high pressure mercury lamp, natural light and UV lamp were shown. Results showed that light source, pH, temperature, time and different aqueous solutions were important factors for photodegradation of these antibiotics and also demonstrated photodegradation was an important environmental fate of these antibiotics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2200721164181822802", "cites_id": ["2200721164181822802"], "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5a116b9c-e21e-3825-91ae-f4f6b1f0017f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ut29KD2Iih4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
