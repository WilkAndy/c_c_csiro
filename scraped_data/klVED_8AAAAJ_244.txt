Substrate induced respiration (SIR), substrate induced nitrification (SIN) and phosphatases and chitinase enzymatic activities were assessed during a 30-day microcosm study. The pesticides were applied to soils at recommended rates either alone, or as binary mixtures with TBC. Soil samples were sampled at 5, 15 and 30 days after pesticide treatments. Substrate induced respiration was only transiently affected by pesticides in both soils. In contrast, the process of indigenous nitrification was affected by the presence of pesticides in both soils, especially when the pesticides were applied as binary mixtures. Substrate induced nitrification increased with pesticides in the Griffith soil (except with MOL+TBC after 5 days) whereas SIN values were non-significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15972886300066919149", "cites_id": ["15972886300066919149"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03601230902728195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7TIxQXYXq90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
