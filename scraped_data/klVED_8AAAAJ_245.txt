Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of predicted and measured water contents revealed that both models performed well under \u2018rainfall\u2019, but prediction was less satisfactory under the treatment of \u2018rainfall + irrigation\u2019. Both models failed to simulate the bimodal distribution of Br - and the herbicides observed under \u2018rainfall + irrigation\u2019 treatment. Distribution of Br - and the 3 herbicides in the profile was over- or under-estimated at certain depths and times, probably due to the limitations inherent to the models (e.g. inability to deal with the macropore flow), and to simplifications associated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9621241025393615573", "cites_id": ["9621241025393615573"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR00080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1WIAsbyDhYUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
