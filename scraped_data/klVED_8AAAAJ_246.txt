This interest has been instigated by concerns associated with the effects of human activities on the environment. Numerous examples may be cited that illustrate the adverse impact of human activities on the subsurface environment, such as contamination of soil and groundwater by chemicals associated with industrial and commercial operations, service stations, waste disposal facilities, and agricultural production. An overview of the impact of such activities on the quality of the soil environment in the Australasia-Pacific Region is presented in Chapters 14 to 25."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6735903940029892129", "cites_id": ["6735903940029892129"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-1626-5_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Icai8vG8el0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
