Sorption/desorption behaviour of five herbicides commonly used in sugarcane production (imazapic, atrazine, hexazinone, diuron and metribuzin) was studied on these mill muds, as is and after adding these to three soils at different rates (5\u201325%, dry weight basis). All mill muds had significant sorption capacity, especially for diuron, atrazine and metribuzin which was 6 to 26 times higher than the soil with 3.5% organic carbon (OC). Generally, sorption of the five herbicides assessed in all mill muds followed the order diuron > atrazine = metribuzin > hexazinone = imazapic. Eight out of 11 mill muds had similar sorption capacity for any given herbicides.
