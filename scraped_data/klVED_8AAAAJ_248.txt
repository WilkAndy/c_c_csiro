We used HYDRUS (2D/3D) to quantify the long-term (8\u202fyears) influence of crops (almonds, wine grapes and potato-carrot) irrigated with recycled water on water and solute exchange at the Gawler River interface in relation to vegetation buffer widths from 10 to 110\u202fm. We found that under almond and annual horticulture the likely average annual water flow from the irrigated area to the river was nearly twice as much (2.1 and 1.8, respectively) that under wine grapes. The hydraulic exchange at river interface for different irrigated crops was found to be sensitive to the buffer widths. For wine grapes, almonds and annual horticulture, the average annual hydraulic balance reached an equilibrium at 20, 65 and 55\u202fm buffer widths, respectively. Furthermore, for wine grapes, with a 20\u202fm buffer width, the average \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16656575014503210048", "cites_id": ["16656575014503210048"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169419300927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QFwcsrkKKOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
