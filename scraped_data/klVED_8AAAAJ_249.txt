The objective of this study was to elucidate mechanistic interactions of copper (Cu2+) and nickel (Ni2+) with different chars produced by pyrolysis (green waste, GW; blue-Mallee, BM) and forest fires (fresh-burnt by prescribed fire, FC; aged char produced by wild fire, AC). The pyrolytic chars were more effective sorbents of Cu2+ (\u223c11 times) and Ni2+ (\u223c5 times) compared with the forest fire chars. Both cross-polarization (CPMAS-NMR) and Bloch decay (BDMAS-NMR) 13C NMR spectroscopies showed that forest fire chars have higher woody components (aromatic functional groups) and lower polar groups (e.g. O-alkyl C) compared with the pyrolytic chars. The polarity index was greater in the pyrolytic chars (0.99\u20131.34) than in the fire-generated chars (0.98\u20131.15), while aromaticity was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8902118848405719429", "cites_id": ["8902118848405719429"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116319753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hUmIW-2tinsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
