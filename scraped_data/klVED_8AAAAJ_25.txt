The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of PFASs affect the sorption behaviour and suggest organic carbon may not be the only factor affecting sorption. We reviewed the quality of all data published in peer-reviewed literature on sorption of PFASs to critically evaluate the role organic carbon (OC) and other properties have in sorption of PFASs in soils or sediments. The largest data sets available were for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, n\u202f=\u202f147) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, n\u202f=\u202f178), and these analyses showed very weak correlations between sorption coefficient (Kd) and OC alone (R2\u202f=\u202f0.05\u20130.07). When only laboratory-derived Kd values of PFASs and OC were analysed, the R2 values increased for PFOA (R2\u202f=\u202f0.24, n\u202f=\u202f42), PFOS (R2\u202f=\u202f0.38, n\u202f=\u202f69 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13811235320075515002", "cites_id": ["13811235320075515002"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718302043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:evRtOlldq78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 30, "2020": 31, "2021": 64, "2022": 65, "2023": 23}}
