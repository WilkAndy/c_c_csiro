Soil-landscape analysis was carried out in an apple orchard which had a strong texture contrast soil and a landform with relief difference of 50m. Diuron sorption (Kd) affinity was successfully predicted (R2=0.79; p<0.001) using a mid-infrared \u2013 partial least squares model and calibrated against measured data using a conventional batch sorption technique. Soil and terrain properties explained 75% of the variance of diuron Kd with TOC, pHw, slope and WI as key variables. Mean diuron Kd values were also significantly different (p<0.05) between alley and tree line and between the different management zones. Soil in the tree line generally had lower sorption capacity for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13061850395245968580", "cites_id": ["13061850395245968580"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389412003299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xHzu1boDRbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
