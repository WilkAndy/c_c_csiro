This study employs a recently developed unsaturated transient flow method to determine the sorption of isoxaflutole's herbicidally active diketonitrile degradate (DKN) and dicamba. A 20-cm acrylic column was packed with soils with varied texture that had been uniformly treated with 14C-labeled chemical.The antecedent solution herbicide in equilibrium with sorbed phase herbicide was displaced by herbicide-free water, which was infiltrated into the column. Sorption coefficients, Kd, were obtained from a plot of total herbicide concentration in the soil versus water content in the region where the antecedent solution accumulated. DKN Kd values were \u223c2\u20133 times (average Kd = 0.71 L kg\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8309132042815131056", "cites_id": ["8309132042815131056"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03601230600850903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sM3Pu5H3T3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
