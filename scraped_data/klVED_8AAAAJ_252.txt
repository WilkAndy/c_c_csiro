These included sources, exposure pathways, bioavailability, and toxicity to receptor organisms as well as risk communication. It was concluded that although the overseas experience on ERA for terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., International Standards or guidelines from the European Union and the United States) is very useful, it is not directly applicable to Australia due to the differences in receptor organisms, contaminants, soil, and environmental conditions. Workshop discussions stressed on the need for making ERA locally relevant (in terms of choice of receptor organisms, sampling strategy, and bioavailability considerations). The workshop discussions highlighted the need of better appreciation of both the similarities and the clear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1371659483970958619", "cites_id": ["1371659483970958619"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10807030500430500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G3XihggdCRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
