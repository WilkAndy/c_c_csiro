DFOB enhances the availability of iron (III) in Fe deficient soils. Organic acids like oxalic acid (OA), are also frequently found in the rhizosphere. These compounds chelate heavy metals and thus affect their mobility and bioavailability. We carried out experiments to evaluate the effects of DFOB and OA on Cd desorption from goethite. In these experiments desorption behavour of Cd adsorbed on goethite was studied at two initial Cd concentrations (ie 180 and 300 \u03bcM) in the presence of 300 \u03bcM DFOB and 200 \u03bcM OA and the combination of two. Following adjustment to pH 6.0, goethite samples were equilibrated overnight with DFOB/OA at 25\u00b12 C using 0.01 M Ca (NO3) 2 as the background electrolyte.The presence of the DFOB and OA enhanced Cd desorption substantially. Approximately 70 and 77% of initially adsorbed Cd from 180 \u03bcM Cd was desorbed after 15 successive desorptions in the presence of DFOB and OA, respectively compared with 46% desorption in the control sample. The corresponding desorptions from 300 \u03bcM Cd had almost the similar trend to that of 180 \u03bcM Cd. Furthermore, Fe concentration in the equilibrium solution increased in the presence of DFOB as compared to control, which showed that dissolution of Cd adsorbed goethite possibly enhanced the desorption of Cd in the presence of DFOB. However, in presence of OA increased Cd desorption was mainly due to decreased equilibrium pH from 6.0 to 4.8. The study shows the significant role that siderophores and organic acids can play in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8067790458250511772", "cites_id": ["8067790458250511772"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Balwant-Singh-4/publication/228738199_Cadmium_desorption_from_goethite_in_the_presence_of_desferrioxamine_B_and_oxalic_acid/links/0912f51115326b0113000000/Cadmium-desorption-from-goethite-in-the-presence-of-desferrioxamine-B-and-oxalic-acid.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nMVOQq2M9m8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
