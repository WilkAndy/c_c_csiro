Existing laboratory leaching methods have limitations when assessing field leaching. For 37 aged field soils from five sites historically contaminated with PFAS over decades, we assess PFAS leaching using new and existing laboratory leaching methods to provide alternative methods better reflecting PFAS risks posed by its leaching and movement. Dominant PFAS in the soils were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, and perfluorohexanoic acid and to a lesser extent perfluorooctanoic acid. Leaching from intact soil cores (Exp 1) was taken to reflect field conditions. These were compared to two new laboratory batch tests, saturate-spin (Exp 2) and saturate-tumble-spin (Exp 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:iyewoVqAXLQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5387552679704149644", "cites_id": ["5387552679704149644"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722036592", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jD54Ip5uxEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 6}}
