The range of chemicals required for effective health care are therefore highly diverse, and they can enter a number of environmental compartments, including aquatic and terrestrial environments and the atmosphere. The physicochemical properties of the chemicals will have an important bearing on their fate and the environments into which they are released. This chapter will give an overview of the processes that influence the overall environmental fate of chemical contaminants sourced from health-care provision."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13393543587656330129", "cites_id": ["13393543587656330129"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444638571000036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kWv3Ue5s37kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
