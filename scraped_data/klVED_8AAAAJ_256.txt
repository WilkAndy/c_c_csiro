If only the fraction of the organic compounds in the microbe-accessible region (e.g., soil pore water) is directly subject to intracellular transformation, sorption into microbe-absent regions (e.g., intra-particle/intra-aggregate micro-pores/interstitial spaces) may become rate-limiting to biodegradation, thus a non-first order decline may be expected in the soil-water system. In this paper, several data sets with direct measurements of soil pore water concentrations are used to elucidate the effect of sorption/desorption on biodegradation. Macro rate constants equivalent to the Double First-Order in Parallel (DFOP) model are derived for gauging the non-first order behavior and for calculating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8672841690373009886", "cites_id": ["8672841690373009886"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2014-1174.ch002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3rHhE5EfXHgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
