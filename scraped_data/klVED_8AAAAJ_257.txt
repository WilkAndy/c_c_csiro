They persist in aquatic environments, even under UV irradiation, and thus there is a need to improve their photolytic degradation to minimise the environmental exposure risks. We investigated the effects of four iron\u2013carboxylate complexes on the UV photodegradation of three benzotriazoles in aqueous solutions and show that they significantly increase the degradation rates of benzotriazoles.  Abstract The effects of FeIII\u2013carboxylate complexes on the photodegradation of three benzotriazoles (BTs), i.e. benzotriazole (BT), 5-methylbenzotriazole (5-TTri) and 5-chlorobenzotriazole (CBT) in aqueous solutions were investigated under exposure to UV irradiation at 254nm in the presence of FeIII and four carboxylate ions (oxalate, tartrate, succinate and citrate).
