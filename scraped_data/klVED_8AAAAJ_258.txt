Their aim is to reduce the cost and technical, environmental and financial risks for large scale CO2 capture, to test, verify and demonstrate technology for CO2 capture owned and marketed by suppliers, and to promote development of technology and suppliers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7690685985039848914", "cites_id": ["7690685985039848914"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7690685985039848914&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0hVgCSjOumoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
