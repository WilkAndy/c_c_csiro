The total xenoestrogen concentrations in effluent ranged between 2446 ng/L and 6579 ng/L, with 4-NP and NPE1-2 having much higher concentration levels than BPA and 4-t-OP. The estrogen levels in effluent varied from 9.12 to 32.22 ng/L for E1, from 1.37 ng/L to 6.35 ng/L for E2 and from 0.11 ng/L to 1.20 ng/L for EE2. No significant differences (p<0.05) in the concentrations of the selected estrogenic compounds were found for the effluents from the five sewage treatment plants. The estrogens and xenoestrogens were also found in the receiving waters at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7697865558513100096,13922678831929420421", "cites_id": ["7697865558513100096", "13922678831929420421"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969709005579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QCXjv_BP1GoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 14, "2011": 12, "2012": 21, "2013": 16, "2014": 24, "2015": 20, "2016": 18, "2017": 17, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
