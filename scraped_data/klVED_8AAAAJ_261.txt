Structural parameters gleaned from non-linear least-squares fitting of EXAFS data revealed that Cd ions form single edge-sharing (1ECd\u2212Fe) surface complexes on goethite after 16 h regardless of equilibrium temperature. After 180 d, both 20 and 40\u00b0C EXAFS samples show the formation of double-edge sharing (2ECd\u2212Fe) surface complexes indicated by circa one Fe atom at an average radial distance (RCd\u2212Fe) of 3.30 \u00c5 in addition to circa one Fe atom at 3.13 \u00c5. Contributions from double-corner sharing (2CCd\u2212Fe) surface complexes at 3.80\u00b10.05 \u00c5 remained minor, which we ascribed to differing reaction conditions of the samples in this vs. previous studies.
