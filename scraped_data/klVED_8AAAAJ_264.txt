Twenty four different scenarios for potential pesticide impacts were identified by G-MW. The assessment for these was made by the authors using intellectual property and tools available in CSIRO, G-MW's pesticide survey data and raw data collected by G-MW Project Supervisor and field staff.The 24 scenarios considered in this risk assessment study represent different combinations of locations, land use, exposure pathways and receiving environment for water from channels in the six irrigation areas of the G-MW (Pyramid-Boort, Rochester-Campaspe, Torrumbarry, Murray Valley, Shepparton and Central Goulburn)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18354201538978526417", "cites_id": ["18354201538978526417"], "pub_url": "https://www.g-mwater.com.au/downloads/gmw/R_D/pesticides_riskassessment.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0TS-Eg45t_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
