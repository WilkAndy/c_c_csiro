Although the exact number and the amount of pesticides used are not clear, hundreds of different compounds are in use. For example, PESKEM 95, a database of registered pesticides in Australia, shows that there are more than 1100 pesticide products containing about 300 different active ingredients available for use. Such increasing reliance on pesticides for pest control has led to considerable degradation of soil and surface and groundwater quality in many developed and developing countries throughout the world. The lucrative export markets for produce have resulted in a marked escalation in agrochemical use for pest control in several of these countries. Pesticides can have a number of adverse impacts on the crop, soil, and water environment. These include their (i) impact on crop quality,(ii) impact on soil health, and (iii) potential to leach and contaminate surface and groundwater, especially in irrigated areas and in regions of high precipitation. All of these impacts arise from the biochemical and physical interactions between the applied pesticides and soil particles. Contamination of the environment by pesticide residues arises mainly from their application. Pesticide residues have been detected at the point of application in the field, as a result of spray drifts from aerial spraying, run-off from rain, drainage water from irrigated areas and in groundwater at selected sites throughout the world. Although much research has been conducted on the impact of pesticides in soil and water environments in the temperate region there is a dearth of information on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=478806463357263822", "cites_id": ["478806463357263822"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/135195/files/PR085.pdf#page=170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zh-SDPEPpQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3}}
