Natural processes generally include weathering of Cr-containing parent materials similar to the serpentine mineral soils. In such soils Cr concentration is generally high and often exceeds 1000 mg kg-I. However, such soils rarely pose a risk to human or ecosystem health because of the low bioavailability of Cr. In its most stable elemental state, Cr has a 3d5 and 4s1 electronic configuration. Therefore Cr can exist in a number of oxidation states, the two most stable states in soils being Cr (lll) and Cr (V!). Of these, the Cr (lIl) species forms stable tetrahedral complexes because of its much larger crystal field splitting energy. Consequently Cr (IlI) is often the dominant form in the soil environment. The chemistry of Cr in soils is controlled by EhpH interactions through its effect on soil and solution factors. Thus in soils with pH< 4.0 and at Eh values ranging from 400 to 200 mV, Cr (III) is the dominant species. In contrast, Cr (VI) is the predominant species in soils with high pH and with Eh ranging from 200 10 600 mY. Both Cr (III) and Cr (V!) concentrations are also controlled by naturally occurring reductants such as Fe (ll) and organic matter, and oxidants such as Mn (IV). Chromium interacts with colloid particles both through specific and through non-specific adsorption reactions. However, a recent EXAFS study by Ferndorf (1995) indicates that Cr (VI) can bind to oxidic surfaces via either a monodentate (single) or a bidentate mechanism. The chemistry of Cr in waste material is complex and is controlled by the redox coupling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4558420789847972291", "cites_id": ["4558420789847972291"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/135202/files/PR088.pdf#page=41", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w9mki47DQj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
