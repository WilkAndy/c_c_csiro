All analyses were performed on reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection at 270 nm using a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (20:80, v/v). Fortified water samples were extracted with either solid-phase extraction (SPE) or liquid-liquid extraction methods. A detection limit of 0.5 \u03bcg/l was achieved using the SPE method. The imidacloprid residues in soils were extracted with acetonitrile-water (80:20, v/v), and the extract was then evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The concentrated extract was redissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile-water (20:80, v/v) prior to analysis by reversed-phase HPLC. A detection limit of 5 \u03bcg/kg was obtained by this method which is suitable for analysis of environmental samples.
