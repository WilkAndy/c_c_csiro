The sorption of EDCs (triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA) and 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2)) were checked using acrylate, nylon and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber coating with 5 and 1 cm length after 7 days of exposure. Extracts were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Comparing with previous studies, results indicate a promising use of this device for field monitoring as well as for bioavailability studies mimicking the organism uptake from environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8355668548873902525", "cites_id": ["8355668548873902525"], "pub_url": "http://static.sites.sbq.org.br/jbcs.sbq.org.br/pdf/2017-0275SR.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vVmIZEZM9XMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
