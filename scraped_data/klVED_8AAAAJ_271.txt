The predictions of off-site transport of some of the pesticides were verified against actual pesticide concentrations in surface water continuously monitored over two years. To our knowledge, only one other study in the published literature has attempted this. Of the chemicals monitored there was good agreement between the predictions and the field measurements from the apple orchard, but less so for the cherry orchard. In both risk indicators the attenuation factor based on the width of the buffer strip over-estimated the effectiveness of the buffer strip. There was good agreement between the EPRIP and PIRI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11715525399036386331", "cites_id": ["11715525399036386331"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716315017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G1yhZkfolaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
