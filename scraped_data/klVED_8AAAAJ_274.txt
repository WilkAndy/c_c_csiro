However the residual levels of pesticides, and their derivatives, in soils, surface and ground waters are becoming an increasing public concern with respect to human health issues.To help understand the environmental fate of pesticides, and consequently better manage farm practices in Sri Lanka, we studied the degradation of two commonly used pesticides (carbofuran and diazinon) in four soils from Sri Lanka. The soils were selected to give a range of chemical and physical properties from both the wet and dry regions of Sri Lanka. Small additions of 14C pesticide were added to each of the study soils and the% C mineralised by microbial activity was assessed over a period of about two months. In a separate experiment we monitored the general microbial health of the soils during the study period. Additions of 14C glucose were made to the soils and amount of carbon mineralised was measured."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14568174316913884604", "cites_id": ["14568174316913884604"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/84368907/sr67-06.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vP2eEVuNLMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
