PIRI is based on three components, namely the value of the asset (water resources threatened); the source (s) of threat to the asset (pesticides use); the pathway through which the threat is released to the asset. Each component is quantified using pesticide characteristics (toxicity, amount used, sorption and persistence) and soil and other site conditions (water input, erodibility and vulnerability to soil loss, recharge rate, depth of water table etc.). The paper describes PIRI with example applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5706596683105603814", "cites_id": ["5706596683105603814"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:4cfeee10-9a7a-4656-b59e-5cd0129ab038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5pDuzHLnMU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
