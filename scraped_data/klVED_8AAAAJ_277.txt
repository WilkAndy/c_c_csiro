The study of the protection of LMWOC through sorption typically employs soils shaken in solution, which may be compromised by biological activity. We used 14C-labelled glucose as a LMWOC in batch assays of four different soils with contrasting physico-chemical properties (Arenosol, Luvisol, Ferralsol and Andisol). The commonly used biocides NaN3 and HgCl2 were employed alone or in concert across a range of concentrations to assess their efficacy in inhibiting microbial degradation. For short (<1 day) sorption experiments, low NaN3 concentrations (50\u2009\u00b5M) were sufficient to inhibit microbial activity, whereas for longer (2 week) equilibrium assays, only high HgCl2 concentrations (10\u2009mM) were effective in all soils tested. All combinations of biocide were most effective in inhibiting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17758048476822094458", "cites_id": ["17758048476822094458"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR17282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:esIl5QBDcfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
