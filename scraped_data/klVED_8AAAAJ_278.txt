Some of the advantages of risk indicators over comprehensive models are their simplicity, ease of use, and usability when input data are scarce. Early risk indicators used pesticide load as a measure of risk. This approach, however, was found to be an inadequate measure of risk and evolved to include a complex range of chemical and environmental properties that may determine the risk of pesticides especially to ecosystem health. The environmental risk indicators available vary greatly in terms of purpose, compartments used, and methodology used. The risk indicators that consider fate, transport, and toxicity of pesticides have been found to be particularly attractive. This chapter provides an overview of the types of risk indicators available from around the world and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12987362085506950974", "cites_id": ["12987362085506950974"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128161555000130", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PqcEvAFhPLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
