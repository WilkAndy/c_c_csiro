In addition, a detailed investigation into the removal of these compounds was also carried out in four STPs with different technologies (Plant A: conventional activated sludge; plant B: two oxidation ditches; plant C: three bioreactors; and plant D: ten lagoons in series). The concentrations of these compounds in the effluents from the fifteen STPs showed substantial variations among the STPs, with their median concentrations ranging from 26 ng/L for caffeine to 710 ng/L for carbamazepine. Risk assessment based on the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of the monitoring data from the present study suggested potential toxic risks to aquatic organisms posed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7334656363906052890", "cites_id": ["7334656363906052890"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2009/em/b904548a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GrMtMBrvyWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 8, "2011": 14, "2012": 15, "2013": 20, "2014": 19, "2015": 22, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 7}}
