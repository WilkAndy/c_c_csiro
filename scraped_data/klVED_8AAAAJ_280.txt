Although degradation of these pollutants by microorganisms is limited by the cold conditions, other pathways such as photodegradation may be significant. Our results indicate that, during the summer, photolysis is a potentially significant degradation pathway for organic micropollutants in Antarctic surface waters, although the rate of loss would depend on ice cover and water depth.  Abstract Knowledge of the environmental fate of organic micropollutants in Antarctica is limited, especially with respect to photolysis. The Antarctic is characterised by extreme light conditions of either continuous sunshine or darkness depending on the season.
