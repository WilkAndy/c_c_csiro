Surface and sub-surface soils were collected from several sites under native vegetation (Banksia woodland) and under market gardens around Perth. Sorption was measured by a batch equilibration method employing a single-solution concentration. The sorption coefficients (Kd) were calculated assuming a linear relation between solution and sorbed concentrations. The pesticides studied included atrazine and its two main metabolites (desethylatrazine and desisopropylatrazine), fenamiphos and its two main metabolites (sulfoxide and sulfone), fenarimol, azinphos methyl and prometryn. The soils studied showed a wide range of sorption capacities for pesticides. While a general trend of higher sorption with higher organic matter content of the soil was apparent, organic carbon alone could not explain the differences. The metabolites of atrazine and fenamiphos had much lower sorption affinities for soils than their respective parent compounds. The metabolites of fenamiphos had an order-of-magnitude lower sorption than their parent compound in some soils. Given that these metabolites are equally toxic in nature and more persistent than their parent compounds, the potential of the metabolites themselves to pollute groundwater should be taken into account. For most soils the Kd values for desisopropylatrazine were the lowest, and azinphos methyl the highest. The pesticides in descending order of sorption were: azinphos methyl> fenarimol> prometryn> fenamiphos> atrazine> fenamiphos sulfone> fenamiphos \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11949507078666270712", "cites_id": ["11949507078666270712"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/135376/files/PR104.pdf#page=113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-DfreGAt1aUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
