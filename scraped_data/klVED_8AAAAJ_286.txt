The composition of the sludge material varied considerably. Chromium (Cr) concentrations ranged from I% to 3% with similar variation in the concentrations of lime and major and minor nutrients. Incubati on of soil s with va rying amounts of sludge led to significant (P< 0.00 I) changes in pH (from 5 to> 7), and soil solution concentrations ofCr (12-222 pg mL') and all the major and minor nutrients. Scatter plot diagrams together with correlation studies revealed a strongly signi ficant (P< 0.001) relationship between soil solution Cr and pH and Cr and manganese (Mn) ions. The strong relationship between Cr and Mn may indicate Mn (IV)-induced oxidation of Cr (Ill) in these soils. Pots of the study soils were seeded with clover and germination was recorded iil all treatments. However, seedling emergence and plant shoots in'high'treatment pots showed symptoms similar to those induced by metals such as alullliniulll. These symptollls persisted throughout the growth period. Markedly smaller yields were recorded at sludge applications exceeding 4 g kg-'in two sludge treatlllents and 2 g kg-'in the other sludge treatment. Examination of the plant composition data and the soil solution Cl'concentrations showed severe toxic effects of Cr on plant growth in soil solutions exceeding 40 pg Cr L'. These results confirm the tox ic effect of Cr on plant growth. The Cr concentrations of plant tissues also increased initially with sludge application and then decreased at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17014420088600841131", "cites_id": ["17014420088600841131"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/135202/files/PR088.pdf#page=127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q8tSoOxcH-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
