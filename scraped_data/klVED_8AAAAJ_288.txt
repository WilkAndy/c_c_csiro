Results indicated that sorption/desorption of most of the shorter-carbon-chain PFASs (C \u2264 6) in soil reached greater than 99% rapidly\u2500after approximately two pore volumes (PVs) and were well predicted by an equilibrium transport model, indicating that they will be readily removed by soil washing technologies. In contrast, the equilibrium model failed to predict the mobilization of longer-chain PFASs (C \u2265 7), indicating the presence of nonequilibrium sorption/desorption (confirmed by a flow interruption experiment). The actual time taken to attain 99% sorption/desorption was up to 5 times longer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14527033452538228207", "cites_id": ["14527033452538228207"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.2c00401", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7-3BIvVjmskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
