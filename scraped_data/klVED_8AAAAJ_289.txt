The study is to be conducted at two locations in the Surat Basin, Queensland and will involve the collection of samples of surface waters, groundwater, fluids from the hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations, produced water and soils.The collection of 113 water samples and 40 soil samples is planned, with these samples undergoing 22 analytical procedures to determine the concentration of more than 150 potential contaminants including organics, inorganics and radionuclides. The number of samples for each category was dictated by the site conditions (number of wells, surface water bodies) as well as time and resource constraints. The list of contaminants for analysis was developed following a review of recent relevant published literature on CSG operations and covers both inorganic and organic chemicals (including those occurring naturally (geogenic)) that may be potential contaminants of soil and waters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14667799909658001966", "cites_id": ["14667799909658001966"], "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Water-Project-11-Task-5-report-monitoring-plan.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LgKs801-jssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
