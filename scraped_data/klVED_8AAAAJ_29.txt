In this study we investigated the sorption of benzene and toluene in single-sorbate and bi-sorbate systems on different types of charcoals produced in laboratory, employing the batch sorption technique. Air dried plant materials from Phalaris grass (Phalaris tuberosa) and Red Gum wood (Eucalyptus camadulensis) were combusted under limited oxygen supply at 250\u00b0C, 450\u00b0C, and 850\u00b0C. The resulting charcoals were characterized for their specific surface areas, total cation content, and pore size distributions (pore size distribution only for wood combusted at 450\u00b0C and 850\u00b0C). For the materials treated at 850\u00b0C not only the surface area, microporosity, and total amount of sorbed sorbate increased markedly, but also the non-linearity of the sorption isotherm.
