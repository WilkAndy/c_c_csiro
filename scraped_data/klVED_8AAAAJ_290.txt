The project considers potential contamination in deeper groundwater and potential transport pathways via deeper groundwater to water bores and aquatic and terrestrial receptors linked to surface water environments. This framework will allow a rapid screening to determine which chemicals are more likely to be hazardous and which may present potential risks to the environment and human health. The framework will be developed and tested in two separate study areas. Application of the framework will allow chemicals with low hazard levels to be readily excluded from separate, more detailed environmental risk assessments. This also provides a robust evidence base to inform future research priorities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11626648156256543326", "cites_id": ["11626648156256543326"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dirk-Mallants/publication/321824336_Deeper_groundwater_hazard_screening_research/links/5a334c7e0f7e9b2a288985cc/Deeper-groundwater-hazard-screening-research.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XiIfwuUmWqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
