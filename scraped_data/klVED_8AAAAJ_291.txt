Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation have been strong underlying themes of Australian biochar research, with contaminant focus on its use as a soil amendment in agriculture. Clear messages from the research are often hampered by the high level of variation reported in key study parameters, including the biochar types used and the soil environments they are applied to. Nevertheless, field trials within the eastern agricultural region support the wider global view that highly weathered acidic soils (e.g., Ferrosols) provide a good target system where biochar can improve pH and nutrient availability and reduce Al toxicity. The results from the southern and western regions are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10421899740141786615", "cites_id": ["10421899740141786615"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaspecpub63.2014.0052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9xXjl5gGopAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
