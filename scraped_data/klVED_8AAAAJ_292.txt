Similarly there has also been heightened public concern over the entry of such chemicals into aquatic environments including rivers, lakes and streams which supply input water for drinking water treatment plants. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have received particular attention in recent times due to some compelling evidence suggesting undesirable environmental or human health effects. Some of the potential contaminants include:(i) steroid hormones and pharmaceuticals and their metabolites (eg 17\u03b2-estradiol, estriol, estrone, 17\u03b1ethynylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol);(ii) domestic and industrial detergent residues and degradates (eg linear alkyl benzene sulphonates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14155150600254869628", "cites_id": ["14155150600254869628"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=procite:d6c0c077-b07c-43db-b026-ba92657f66f5&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fFBZRnkyccQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
