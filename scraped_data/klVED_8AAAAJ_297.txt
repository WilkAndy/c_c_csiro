Due to the ever increasing use of plastics, elastomers, and other polymers in our daily lives, polymer-based materials (PBMs) are detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in water and wastewater. The present review provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the contribution of PBMs - including elastomers, tire waste, polyelectrolytes, and microplastics - as precursors of DBPs in water and wastewater. Literature shows that the presence of PBMs can lead to the leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and subsequent formation of DBPs upon disinfection in aqueous media. The quantity and type of DBPs formed strongly depends on the type of polymer, its concentration, its age, water salinity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:hNSvKAmkeYkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5370600546635077494", "cites_id": ["5370600546635077494"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135422014737", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dtezFL40iEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
