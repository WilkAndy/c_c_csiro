Thousands of different PFAS have been used in a wide range of products, such as food packaging, water-repellent and stain-resistant clothing and fire-fighting foams. Partially due to their extreme stability and high mobility, PFAS are now ubiquitous in the environment. Due to their prolonged persistence, some PFAS have been added to the list of persistent organic pollutants. Sorption is one of the fundamental processes that governs environmental fate and effects of organic chemicals. In recent years, a significant body of literature has been published on sorption of PFAS in soils. However, there are conflicting reports about the soil or sediment properties that may be used to predict the mobility of PFAS in the soil environment. This is not surprising because PFAS have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10796169549715110900", "cites_id": ["10796169549715110900"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR22183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9HuoQQGz05UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
