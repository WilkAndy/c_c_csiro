Assessing the benefits and risks of the novel nano-products requires a good understanding of their fate in soil relative to other forms of copper. This study compares nine forms of Cu including nano and conventional Cu-based formulations, as well as their salt or bulk equivalents. Readily available Cu was extracted with 0.01 M CaCl2 over a period of 29 days in three soils with contrasting properties. For eight out of nine formulations, available Cu decreased over time indicating that complexation of Cu with soil phases was the process determining the availability of Cu. Freshly suspended CuO nanoparticles were the only form where available Cu increased over time, indicating that dissolution was limiting availability. The complexation/dissolution kinetics were mainly determined by the soil pH, whereas both soil pH and OC% determined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13057271233586296842", "cites_id": ["13057271233586296842"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/en/d1en00213a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CnjWrQG_NLUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
