Adsorption of Cd was measured using water, 0.01 mol dmp\u22123 Ca(NO3)2, and various concentrations of NaNO3 (0.01\u20131.5 mol dm\u22123) as background solutions at a range of pH values (3\u20138).In all soils, the net surface charge decreased with an increase in pH. The pH at which the net surface charge was zero (point of net zero charge, PZC) differed between the soils. The PZC was higher for soils dominated by variable\u2010charge components (Oxisols and Andept) than soils dominated by permanent charge (Xeralf, Xerert and Fragiaqualf). For all soils, the adsorption of Cd increased with an increase in pH and most of the variation in adsorption with pH was explained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 720, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1905006164141265778", "cites_id": ["1905006164141265778"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1994.tb00527.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ctORXAPxbxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 8, "1997": 3, "1998": 11, "1999": 8, "2000": 8, "2001": 18, "2002": 15, "2003": 21, "2004": 12, "2005": 21, "2006": 21, "2007": 20, "2008": 22, "2009": 22, "2010": 38, "2011": 25, "2012": 29, "2013": 41, "2014": 51, "2015": 36, "2016": 54, "2017": 42, "2018": 45, "2019": 31, "2020": 41, "2021": 36, "2022": 26, "2023": 11}}
