Biochars were prepared by burning of red gum (Eucalyptus spp.) woodchips at 450 and 850\u00b0C (labeled as BC450 and BC850). These two biochars were found to possess markedly different properties in terms of surface area and porosity. Short-term equilibration tests (24 hr) were conducted to assess the sorption-desorption behavior of pyrimethanil in the soil amended with various amounts of biochar of each type, with a special focus on the desorption behavior of the sorbed pesticide through four times successive desorption by dilution. Sorption coefficient and isotherm nonlinearity of the amended soils progressively increased with the content of biochar in the soil. Biochar BC850 with higher surface area and microporosity showed a stronger effect on the reversibility of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15590789143114776530", "cites_id": ["15590789143114776530"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074209601534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0n9fQx-cXdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 22, "2014": 14, "2015": 26, "2016": 12, "2017": 18, "2018": 15, "2019": 10, "2020": 17, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
