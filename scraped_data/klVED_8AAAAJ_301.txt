The bioaccessibility study based on the E value model involved monitoring stable isotopes exchanging with the bioaccessible phase, while this exchangeability was also estimated with sediment extractions with butanol and \u03b2-HPCD, respectively.Based on the E value method, TCS was readily exchangeable for up to 7 days, while after this period become virtually non \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11001265565578864987", "cites_id": ["11001265565578864987"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-017-1905-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W6kQpL5YrJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
