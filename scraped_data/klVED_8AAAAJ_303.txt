To do that we need to know what the impacts are, and predict how they will respond to changes in land use and management. Environmental impacts occur through movement and transformations of energy and materials. In an ideal world, we might monitor all these processes, but that is simply not feasible. We therefore need to estimate them, and this involves models.Models are simple abstractions of complex systems and always involve a trade-off between complexity and comprehensibility. All of our understanding and knowledge of the environment is in fact in the form of models, because we must simplify the system to make sense of it. The better we understand systems, that is, the better our conceptual models, the more likely we can quantify them and describe them with mathematical relationships. A theoretically ideal model for a question might describe all the important processes mechanistically across space and time, be initialised with easily measured parameters and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11619046747048252796", "cites_id": ["11619046747048252796"], "pub_url": "https://agritrop.cirad.fr/587483/1/2018.Nelson%20et%20al.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fBV4wnQlP6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
