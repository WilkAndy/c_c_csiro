While the benefits of biochar applications to soil fertility have been well recognised, the potential negative implications of biochar amendment to soils, especially the impact on contaminant fate, dispersal and build-up is thus far not fully appreciated. This paper presents research that shows that biochar addition to soil can potentially lead to accumulation of contaminants residues in soil. The highly reactive biochar can render applied pesticide ineffective and consequently much higher application rates may be needed for the desired pest and disease control. Biochar itself can potentially serve as a source of combustion related toxicants such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins. The implication of biochar amendment to soil and potential implications for the environmental accumulation, distribution and food safety of pesticides needs to be fully understood before recommending widespread application of biochar to soils as a climate change mitigation initiative."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2604048869889393032", "cites_id": ["2604048869889393032"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/76151495/0482.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iMGDe6ZwIyQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
