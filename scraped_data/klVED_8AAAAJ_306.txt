Technologies that are fairly simple, easy to adopt and can help in improving environmental performance are identified as \u2018low hanging fruits ready to be picked\u2019. There are several options to reduce water use within wineries and in turn, also reduce the volume of wastewater requiring treatment. For example, using brooms, squeegees and shovels rather than a hose to clean work areas are very effective in reducing water use. High pressure hoses use less water than low pressure hoses. Covering all drains with a suitable mesh to stop solid waste material going into the wastewater system is effective in reducing the wastewater load.A significant amount of wine (up to 10%) can be lost within the winery due to spillage and transfers. Reduction of loss of product by using techniques such as pigging not only increase production but also reduce wastewater load. Minimising waste produced is always a cheaper option than spending money on treatment capacity and operating costs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2091918098791131155", "cites_id": ["2091918098791131155"], "pub_url": "https://www.wineaustralia.com/getmedia/dab7e46c-f3ee-4efb-b398-d42f8cb019f3/CSIRO-wastewater-article-(workshops-to-practice).pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E-inaW38Bx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
