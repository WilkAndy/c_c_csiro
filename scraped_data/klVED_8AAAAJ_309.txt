In the absence of local data the resource managers and regulatory agencies of many countries, particularly of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific, have to rely on databases from elswhere. However, behavior of pesticides in the terrestrial ecosystems of these countries can be different due to the inherently diverse chemical properties of soils. Combinations of the chemical properties as well as site-specific conditions determine the fate and behavior of pesticides. These conditions vary greatly among different agroecological zones making the direct extrapolation of data between geographical regions very challenging. This article focuses on the effects of soil and nvironmental conditions, with particular attention to the chemistry of soil organic matter, associated with tropical and temperate regions on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13319207867694737960", "cites_id": ["13319207867694737960"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2007-0966.ch007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KGqIy_xU17gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
