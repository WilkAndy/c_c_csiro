The concentrations in the effluent from the two\u2010year survey were similar to those reported in other studies. In the effluent, 4\u2010NP, NPEO1, and NPEO2 had total concentrations up to 8 \u03bcg/L, which were much higher than those of BPA and 4\u2010t\u2010OP. Estrone had the highest concentrations among the three estrogens, ranging between 13.3 and 39.3 ng/L, whereas the concentrations for E2 and EE2 varied between 1.0 and 4.2 ng/L and between 0.1 and 1.3 ng/L, respectively.
