To establish whether plants could take up strychnine, glasshouse experiments were conducted on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L), lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba\u2010bean (Vicia faba L.). Strychnine uptake was also determined by growing plants from germinated baits. In the glasshouse experiments strychnine was detected in lupine grain (<80\u20132500 \u00b5g kg\u22121) and in straw from wheat, barley, pea, faba\u2010bean, and lupine (<40\u2013390 \u00b5g kg\u22121) when these plants were grown adjacent to 1 or 3 baits, equivalent to 36 to 107 times the recommended field rate, respectively. Strychnine was also detected in straw from the germinated baits (<40\u20132233 \u00b5g kg\u22121). Field experiments were then conducted to study strychnine uptake by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10512928468198839677", "cites_id": ["10512928468198839677"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900040041x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fVUV8L1s5ZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
