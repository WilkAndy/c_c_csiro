As a consequence of pesticide use, trace levels of their residues are present in air, water and other components of the ecosystem. This is a cause of concern from the point of view of both the ecosystem and human health. Simple but sound methods are therefore needed by pesticide users and regulators for making an assessment of pesticide impact and choosing the practices with the least detrimental impact on the environment. In this paper we present a brief overview of simple methods for the assessment of the impact of pesticides on groundwater quality as well as an alternative approach derived by the authors. This latter approach is a Pesticide Impact Ranking Index (PIRI), which represents an advance over other commonly available approaches since it can be used to (i) rank pesticides in a cropping system, and (ii) compare different land uses in a catchment in terms of their relative impact on water quality. PIRI is based on a quantitative risk assessment approach and consists of three components,\u2022 the value of the asset (water resources threatened);\u2022 the source (s) of threat to the asset (pesticides use);\u2022 the pathway through which the threat is released to the asset. Each component is quantified using pesticide characteristics such as toxicity, amount used, sorption and persistence as well as soil and other site conditions such as permeability, depth of water table and water input. A description of each of the three components of PIRI is given in this paper, including an example of the application of the method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12990892971894842478", "cites_id": ["12990892971894842478"], "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/node/594/pr85_pdf_77499.pdf#page=189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:biTpSFTsSLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2}}
