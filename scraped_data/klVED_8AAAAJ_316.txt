The SWP used both physical and chemical processes; fractionation of the soil particles by size and partitioning of PFASs into the aqueous phase to remove PFASs from the soil. Contaminated water was treated in series with granulated activated carbon (GAC) and ion-exchange resin and reused within the SWP. Approximately 2200 t (dry weight) of PFAS-contaminated soil was treated in 25 batches of 90 t each, with a throughput of approximately 11 t soil/hr. Efficiency of the SWP was measured by observed decreases in total and leachable concentrations of PFASs in the soil. Average removal efficiencies (RE) were up to 97.1% for perfluorocarboxylic acids and 94.9% for perfluorosulfonic acids. REs varied among different PFASs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3999429912220904651", "cites_id": ["3999429912220904651"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438942202235X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y6z_tVDUgDcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
