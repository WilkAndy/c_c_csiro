PFAS-free seawater of different salinities was used for the desorption.The range of PFAS desorbed from the sediments were consistent with the sorption behaviour of these compounds with the desorption of PFOS notably lower than PFOA and PFHxS. Approximately 9\u201369% PFOS, 33 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4250086111909114817", "cites_id": ["4250086111909114817"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-022-03172-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wfMpBc1W-zoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
