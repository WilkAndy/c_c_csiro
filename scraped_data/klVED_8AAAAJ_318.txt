The management of such PFAS-contaminated asphalt materials requires an understanding of PFAS concentrations in these materials. This study, therefore, aimed to develop a suitable extraction methodology for the analysis of 22 target PFAS (i.e., carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids and fluorotelomers) in asphalt materials. A series of experiments was conducted to optimise extraction solvent composition, as well as to assess the performance of the chosen method under various conditions (i.e., sonication temperature, PFAS contamination level, asphalt core composition and timing of stable isotope addition used as internal standard). The methanol-based extractants performed best due to their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:m4fbC6XIj1kC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13416866958745412825", "cites_id": ["13416866958745412825"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/ay/d2ay00221c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2SSy0mlJMroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
