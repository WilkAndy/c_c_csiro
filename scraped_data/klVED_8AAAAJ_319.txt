On", "abstract": "A total of 116 chemicals have been identified as being associated with drilling and hydraulic fracturing at shale, tight and deep coal gas operations in the three regions (Cooper, Isa and Beetaloo) of the Geological and Bioregional Assessment (GBA) Program between 2011 and 2016. Of the 116 chemicals, nine were drilling chemicals, 99 were hydraulic fracturing chemicals and eight were chemicals used for both drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Fifty-eight percent of the chemicals identified in the current study were not assessed in the National Assessment of Chemicals Associated with coal seam gas (CSG) extraction in Australia (NICNAS, 2017).A Tier 1 qualitative (screening) environmental risk assessment (ERA) of these chemicals found:(i) 42 chemicals were of \u2018low concern\u2019and considered to pose minimal risk to aquatic ecosystems,(ii) 33 chemicals were of \u2018potentially high concern\u2019and (iii) 41 were of \u2018potential concern\u2019. The identified chemicals of potential concern and potentially high concern would require further site-specific quantitative chemical assessments to be performed to determine risks from specific gas developments to aquatic ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10500499700640974011", "cites_id": ["10500499700640974011"], "pub_url": "https://bioregionalassessments.gov.au/sites/default/files/gba-isa-stage2-appendix-chemicalscreening-final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uwTN_NdEuZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
