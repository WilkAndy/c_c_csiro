All three benzotriazoles were degraded by microorganisms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Both the biodegradation efficiency and biodegradation products were dependent on the predominant terminal electron-accepting condition. Among the redox conditions studied, the shortest biodegradation half lives for BT and 5-TTri were 114 days and 14 days, respectively, under aerobic condition. The shortest half-life for CBT was 26 days under Fe (III) reducing condition. The longest biodegradation half lives for BT and CBT were 315 days and 96 days, respectively, under sulfate reducing condition, while that of 5-TTri was 128 days under nitrate reducing condition.
