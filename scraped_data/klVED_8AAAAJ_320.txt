It combines monitoring and modeling approaches, using analytical and biomonitoring methodologies to target high-impact rating pesticides in surface water and sediments from upstream and downstream \u201ccollection\u201d points. This is referred to as a \u201cblack-box\u201d strategy. This creates a new role for the analytical laboratory that has to apply integrated monitoring and also act on the data obtained from other stakeholders, experts\u2019 judgments and field measurements. Results obtained should be interpreted by a working team to provide an assessment of the indicators of pesticide management practices. The role of the laboratory is to drive the process in a way that is cost-effective, well targeted and matches available resources.
