BC is a ubiquitous component of organic matter in terrestrial and aquatic environments (Goldberg 1985; Schmidt and Noack 2000); for the purposes of this chapter, biochar can be considered as a part of the BC pool, despite the fact that it is a product of pyrolysis and not strictly a combustion process. There is a wealth of published information about sorption of organic compounds on BC that is relevant in terms of interactions of organic compounds with biochars (eg Schwarzenbach et al. 2002).BC and charcoals have been shown to be effective sorbents for organic compounds (Karapanagioti et al. 2000; Accardi-Dey and Gschwend 2003; Lohmann et al. 2005). For example, charred materials produced from burning of crop and wood residues have been found to be several thousand times more effective than soil in sorbing herbicides and naturally occurring organic compounds (Yang and Sheng 2003; Yu et al. 2006; Hall et al. 2014). The highly carbonaceous and aromatic nature of biochars and their high specific surface area (SSA) and microporosity are some of the properties that explain their extraordinary sorption characteristics. Sorption of pesticides to soil organic carbon (SOC) has been found to be correlated with its aromaticity by several researchers and it has been postulated that this reflects variation in the amount of aromatic and highly sorptive BC as a component of SOC (Ahmad et al. 2001; Abelmann et al. 2005).
