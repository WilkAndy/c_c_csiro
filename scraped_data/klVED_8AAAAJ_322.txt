The lack of a proper scientific understanding of this situation by the various stakeholders has been identified as one of the important gaps in the sustainable management of groundwater. This paper shares experiences from Gujarat and Rajasthan in western India where scientists, NGOs, government agencies and village leaders have worked together to explore strategies for sustainable groundwater management. The study involved a total of eleven villages in Gujarat and Rajasthan, India. The study\u2019s main aim was to educate these communities through an intensive capacity building of (mainly) rural youth, called Bhujal Jaankars (BJs), a Hindi word meaning \u2018groundwater informed\u2019. The BJs were trained in their local settings through relevant theory and practical exercises, so that they could perform a geohydrological evaluation of their area, monitor groundwater and share their findings and experiences with their village community. The BJs went through a training program of a series of sessions totalling 45-days that covered mapping, land and water resource analysis, geo-hydrology, and water balance analysis, and finally groundwater management strategies.This approach has highlighted important learning that can be replicated in other parts of the two states and beyond. There are now 35 trained BJs who regularly monitor groundwater and rainfall in the two study watersheds, and provide data to both scientific and their own rural communities \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5278928030176630723", "cites_id": ["5278928030176630723"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Basant-Maheshwari/publication/312622415_Participatory_Groundwater_Management_at_Village_Level_in_India_-_Empowering_Communities_with_Science_for_Effective_Decision_Making/links/5886d9dc92851c21ff4d6550/Participatory-Groundwater-Management-at-Village-Level-in-India-Empowering-Communities-with-Science-for-Effective-Decision-Making.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w9eHEROFQkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
