Therefore, as a follow up of the previous routine sampling program (July 2008), a campaign of intensive sampling was undertaken to assess the extent of variability associated with concentrations of selected micropollutants in influent and effluent samples.Water samples were collected over a one-week period at Oxley Creek wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) from Wednesday 29th August until Tuesday 4th November 2008. Samples were collected on a daily basis at 9 am for seven days, while on Friday 31st August samples were collected every 2 h for a 24 h period. The concentrations of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products were monitored in collected water samples, including the cytotoxic surfactant benzalkonium chloride (BAC), the antiepileptic carbamazepine (CBZ) and the antidepressants fluoxetine (FLX), sertraline (SER) and venlafaxine (VEN). Some of these compounds have not been analysed in previous monitoring campaigns in the current project. In addition, the illicit drug methamphetamine (MAP) was included the suit of analyte as it may reflect a very different use pattern and therefore may serve as a good marker compound."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17191204567030513508", "cites_id": ["17191204567030513508"], "pub_url": "http://www.urbanwateralliance.org.au/publications/uwsra-tr54.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZD_thnhtk-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
