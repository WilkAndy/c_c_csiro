Physico-chemical properties of soil and sediments, especially the content and the chemistry of organic carbon, have a major bearing on not only the sorption and accumulation of POPs but also their degradation and plant uptake. It is now well known that \u201cblack carbon (BC)\u201d(partially combusted material such as soot and charcoal) which has a strong affinity for POPs is ubiquitous in soils and sediments. However, the role of soil and sediment organic carbon, especially of BC, has not been fully appreciated or accounted for in assessment of distribution and impact of POPs on food safety. This paper demonstrates the importance of the chemistry of organic carbon as a strong moderating factors for several processes governing the accumulation, distribution and plant uptake of POPs, namely, sorption-desorption, degradation and bioavailability to plants/microorganisms. Recognizing that, as a response to climate change, biochar amendments of soils is attracting increasing interest globally and \u201cblack is seen as a new green\u201d, the paper highlights the need for better understanding of the long term implications of BC in determining the fate and behaviour of POPs in soils and their potential impact on food safety."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14841045788688752234", "cites_id": ["14841045788688752234"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arvind-Singh-21/post/What_is_the_environmental_relevance_of_carbon_black_in_the_soil/attachment/59d6457479197b80779a08fb/AS%3A453318733504512%401485091016754/download/eb621.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ap4ZeoP89c0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
