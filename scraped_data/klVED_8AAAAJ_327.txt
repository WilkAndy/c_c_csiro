Organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficients (KOC), determined by batch sorption, varied between 405 and 598 Lkg-1 amongst 10 A11 horizons, and between 547 and 975 Lkg-1 amongst 10 matching A12 horizons. In all cases KOC was greater for the A12 horizon than the corresponding A11 horizon by 27\u201381%. Organic matter chemistry of the A11 and A12 horizons was determined using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. KOC was positively correlated with aryl C (r2= 0.61, significance level 0.001) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r2= 0.88, significance level< 0.001) as a single factor and as a combination of both we also propose A index (r2= 0.65, significance level 0.001). Little change in soil mineralogy across a very small field led to diminished organic matter and clay mineral interactions, allowing the effect of organic matter chemistry on KOC to be clearly seen. Keywords: sorption, diuron, NMR spectroscopy. 1 Introduction Diuron, N-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-N, N-dimethyl-urea, is one of the phenyl amide family and belongs to the subclass of phenyl urea. Diuron is a toxic and slightly hazardous type III pesticide on the basis of the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency, USA) and is considered as a priority hazardous substance (PHS) by the European Commission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16482264698673013499", "cites_id": ["16482264698673013499"], "pub_url": "https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-ecology-and-the-environment/110/19073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-6JdqmrEvOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
