Soil organic matter (SOM) is the most important sorbent in soils for non-ionic pesticides. It is often assumed that K oc is approximately constant for a given non-ionic compound in various soils. Consequently data from Europe and North America are often used for environmental risk assessment in many developing countries. However, the properties of SOM are expected to vary among soils of various regions. The objective of this study was to investigate the sorption behaviour of different pesticides in soils from different countries with particular reference to the role of the nature of SOM. We carried out studies on sorption of two non-ionic pesticides (carbaryl and phosalone) on 55 different soils collected from Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, representing a range of soil organic matter contents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18249979956818769596", "cites_id": ["18249979956818769596"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18249979956818769596&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vHYuBBT0RP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
