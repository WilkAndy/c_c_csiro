Soil factors such as pH, temperature, solution Cd concentration, ionic strength and ageing affect Cd adsorption on goethite. The desorption behaviour of Cd from goethite at low concentrations is not fully understood. This study investigates the adsorption\u2013desorption of Cd at low Cd concentrations (Cd adsorbed on goethite from 20 to 300\u03bcM Cd solutions) in Na and Ca nitrate solutions of 0.03M nominal ionic strengths. Synthetic goethite prepared by ageing a ferric hydroxide gel at high pH and room temperature was used for Cd adsorption and desorption studies. For desorption experiment 10 successive desorptions were made for the whole range of initial Cd concentrations (20\u2013300\u03bcM) in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8611213924431688283", "cites_id": ["8611213924431688283"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653504007489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W_KlqnAtgXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 19, "2010": 11, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 15, "2015": 7, "2016": 16, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
