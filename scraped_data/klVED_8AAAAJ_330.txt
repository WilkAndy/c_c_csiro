Since Cr can occur as Cr (lIl) and Cr (VI), mini-electrodes were installed to monitor in situ changes in redox potential. Moisture probes were installed to trace changes in the moisture potential during leaching, and pH was measured as well. At regular intervals, the soil solution was sampled using fibreglass wick samplers installed at several depths in the core. The leachate samples obtained from the wick samplers showed that the pH in the soil monolith decreased from> 8 in the surface soils to< 4 at depths exceeding 40 cm. A similar trend in soluble Cr was recorded in the leachate samples, with values exceeding I mg Li in the surface 10 cm and< 0.1 mg L-1 at depths exceeding 40 cm. However, Cr was not detected in the solution leaching out of the I m long columns. This indicates that Cr that is mobilised in the surface soil layers is rendered immobile towards the deeper end of the profile. In addition to the changes in pH and Cr, l1uctuations in Eh and soluble salts were observed in this study, indicating marked changes in soil solution chemistry with increasing depth of the soil profile.SOURCES of chromium in the soil environment include wastes from industrial activities such as electroplating, electric power production, the leather and pulp industry, and ore and petroleum refining. These industries generate waste products that contain solid and aqueous forms of chromium (Cr)(Forstner and Wittman 1981).
