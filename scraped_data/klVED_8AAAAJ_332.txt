Herbicides are of tremendous benefit to agriculture and modern agricultural systems rely heavily on chemical means of weed control. Their increasing use has, however, resulted in contamination of ground and surface waters under certain conditions with consequent growing concern in the international community regarding their potential effects on non-target organisms. A sound understanding of the factors affecting the mobility of pesticides in soil is an essential prerequisite to the development of functions/models which can accurately representand describe the array of processes which pesticides may undergo in soils. This requires detailed investigations on equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the sorption and desorption processes involved, the nature, extent and rate of any chemical transformation or biological degradation which occurs and the roles of volatalization, convection, diffusion and dispersion in the mobility of the pesticides in relevant soil structures. While a substantial amount of data is available on the interactions of pesticide chemicals with soil constituents, much of this has been obtained on European and North American soils. In addition to the differences in nature and properties of soils and climatic conditions between various regions of the world, there are a number of factors which modify the behaviour of pesticides at a specific site. The effects of soil properties such as texture, clay mineral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12518493737225452338", "cites_id": ["12518493737225452338"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12518493737225452338&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MntGarqfuq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
