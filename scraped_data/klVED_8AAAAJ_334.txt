Globally, airfields and paved firefighting training surfaces are particularly affected due to extensive use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF). This PFAS contamination in exposed concrete and asphalt has not been widely addressed.This review focusses on PFAS interaction with concrete and asphalt, traversing extraction, analytical identification/quantification, PFAS fractionation via differential adsorption on organic and inorganic substrates, and reuse options for contaminated concrete and asphalt. A total of 24 knowledge gaps and management challenges for concrete and asphalt characterisation and management have been identified:\u2022Identification and quantification: Six gaps: extraction/analysis of PFAS from concrete and asphalt (laboratory- and field-based); measure of total precursors; distribution in concrete and asphalt \u2026Identification and quantification: Six gaps: extraction/analysis of PFAS from concrete and asphalt (laboratory- and field-based); measure of total precursors; distribution in concrete and asphalt \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WwIwg2wKZ0QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13942866189916416972", "cites_id": ["13942866189916416972"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723026463", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
