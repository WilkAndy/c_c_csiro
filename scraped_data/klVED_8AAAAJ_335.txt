However, its application has been inhibited by insufficient understanding of the effectiveness of added soil sorbents over time. Herein, we present results on the effectiveness of select carbon-based sorbents, over 4 years (longevity) and multiple laboratory leaching conditions (durability). Standard batch leaching tests simulating aggressive, worst-case scenario conditions for leaching (i.e., shaking for 24\u201348 h at high liquid/solid ratios) were employed to test longevity and durability of stabilisation in clay-loam and sandy-loam soils historically contaminated with PFAS (2 and 14 mg/kg \u221128 PFAS). The different sorbents, which were applied at 1\u20136% (w/w), reduced leaching of PFAS from the soils to varying degrees. Among the 5 sorbents tested, initial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ymY9cBF3mdcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16969104955902645320", "cites_id": ["16969104955902645320"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123002518", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
