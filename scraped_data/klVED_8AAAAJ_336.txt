Composting is one of the preferred ways to convert biodegradable wastes into nutrient-rich soil conditioners. The age-old technique of composting process is being improved with innovative scientific means. Biochar, a widely studied soil amendment, is a carbonaceous material that can hold nutrients from endogenic/exogenic sources. Biochar-compost, a biochar-complemented compost, may provide a wide range of benefits expected from both materials. Compost and biochar can improve physicochemical and microbiological attributes of soils by supplying labile and stable carbons, and nutrients. Compost may also supply beneficial microbes. This means biochar-compost is a synergic soil amendment that can improve soil quality, increase crop production, and remediate contaminated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:N4u4nq0IxgcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1372810765001024832", "cites_id": ["1372810765001024832"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211323000159", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
