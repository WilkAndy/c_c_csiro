We studied the degradation and microbial toxicity of selected HF chemical components including two biocides (methylisothiozolinone- MIT, chloromethylisothiozolinone- CMIT), a gel-breaker aid (triethanolamine -TEA), and three geogenic chemicals (phenol, m-cresol and p-cresol) in ultrapure water, HF fluid and produced water in five different soil types (surface and subsurface soils). The degradation of the two biocides (in soils treated with HF fluid or ultrapure water) and of the three geogenic chemicals (in soils treated with produced water) was rapid (in all cases DT50 values < 2 days in surface soils). In contrast, the loss of TEA was much slower in soils, especially in those treated with HF fluid (DT50 > 30 days). Sorption coefficients (Koc in L/Kg) in these soils ranged from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8058681109707057396", "cites_id": ["8058681109707057396"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974912200968X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Gg9xsUv1m8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
