In 2015, about half a million deaths were estimated to be associated with soil pollution. Many organic pollutants can persist in the soil environment for a long time and are referred to as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This chapter provides an overview of how the chemical properties and fundamental processes of conventional POPs (e.g., polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) as well as new POPs (e.g., Per- and Poly-fluoro Alkyl Substances\u2014PFAS) control their fate and behavior in the soil environment and determine their potential impact on biota."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4588893927185594345", "cites_id": ["4588893927185594345"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4588893927185594345&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
