Residual glyphosate when mixed with water bodies can be a health concern. Updated information concerning the fate of glyphosate in soil systems with biochar amendment is lacking. For this experiment, different biochars were weighed and premixed in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes. A solution (Mixture of mercuric chloride and radiolabeled C14 glyphosate) having different concentrations provided by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization was used. Tubes having solutions were shaken on end over end shaker for 24 h. Tubes were removed from the shaker and centrifuged for 5 min. at 13000 revolutions per minute. Digested, labeled samples after counting disintegration per minute on Tricarb 4810 were used as sorption data. Results showed significant adsorption of glyphosate in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=503117958718186990", "cites_id": ["503117958718186990"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00103624.2021.1925690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7mWEKR5v-wYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
