Solid phase extraction (SPE) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) were applied as the preconcentration method for water samples (ground water and effluent) and biosolid samples, respectively. The optimized method allowed us to quantify all target compounds with the method detection limits ranging from 0.29 to 11.02ng/L, 0.5 to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 160, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17334094668543087347", "cites_id": ["17334094668543087347"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967311007916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:89KA1UITj_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 16, "2014": 11, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 18, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 16, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 11}}
