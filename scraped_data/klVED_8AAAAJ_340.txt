The detection of hazardous compounds in Antarctica, where these compounds were never used or no man has ever lived before, indicates how serious is the problem of long-range atmospheric transport and deposition of non-point-source pollution. This ubiquitous pollution has had a global effect on our soils, which in turn has been affecting their biological health and productivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16482452725843830498", "cites_id": ["16482452725843830498"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429445507-6/pollution-nonpoint-source-ravendra-naidu-mallavarapu-megharaj-peter-dillon-rai-kookana-ray-correll-wenzel", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4iYXJ21vveQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
