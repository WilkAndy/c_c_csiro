Project W12 Final Report to the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA)", "pub_year": 2020, "citation": "CSIRO, Canberra, 2020", "author": "R Kookana and M Williams and A Craig", "publisher": "CSIRO, Canberra", "abstract": "An assessment by Patterson et al.(2017) of potential exposure pathways for contamination of soils with chemicals established that spills of hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluids and produced water are among the most polluting and plausible pathways affecting unconventional gas operations. Spills are unpredictable and are very site\u2010and event\u2010specific. Therefore, as opposed to a field\u2010based soil contamination assessment, a scenario\u2010based study, mimicking the exposure via spills of HF fluid and produced water under laboratory conditions was considered a more appropriate option.This study involved exposing soil samples, representative of the five different soil types from the Surat Basin, to HF fluids and produced waters under controlled laboratory conditions. It is noteworthy that while the drilling pads surfaces are artificially created and hence a spill may not make a direct contact with surface soils immediately. However, it is assumed that with time the constituents of any fluid spilled on the drill\u2010pad surface may infiltrate into soils. In such cases, the current assessment represents a worst\u2010case scenario."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10717247122214065988", "cites_id": ["10717247122214065988"], "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Water-12-Milestone-6-report_final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RJelqXlPu5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
