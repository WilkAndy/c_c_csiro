It is generally assumed that the sorption behaviour of organic compounds is largely moderated by the content of organic matter in soil and sediments, and the role of clay minerals is generally ignored, especially during risk assessment. This is despite the fact that often soils are much richer in the mineral matter, ie its content in soils is often an order of magnitude higher than that of organic matter. Besides, numerous studies over the years have demonstrated that clay minerals, especially expandable smectites, do have a strong affinity for a variety of organic compounds such as pesticides and nitroaromatic compounds. For example, Laird et al.(1992) studied sorption of atrazine on soil smectite clays and showed that relatively pure smectites were quite effective sorbents of the herbicide, depending on their compositions. Similarly, clay minerals were found to be good sorbents for nitroaromatic compounds (eg Haderlien and Schwarzenbach, 1993). Despite the massive body of literature, the role of clays in determining the sorption behaviour of organic compounds and consequently their ecological risks in soils/sediments is still not fully appreciated and incorporated in the risk assessment models.One of the major developments that led to a disproportionate dominance of the role of organic matter in sorption of organic compounds in soils is the introduction of the \u201cpartition theory\u201d(Chiou et al. 1979). According to this theory soil organic matter essentially acts as a simple partitioning medium, akin of an immiscible solvent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2285024275912243521", "cites_id": ["2285024275912243521"], "pub_url": "http://www.smectech.com.au/ACMS/ACMS_Conferences/ACMS23/Program/Abstracts/S3-03%20Kookana%20et%20al.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qbnk7HgJth8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
