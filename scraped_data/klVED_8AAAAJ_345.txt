Chemical contaminants, together with physicochemical stressors from climate change, increasing urbanisation, land use changes and altered water availability, have the potential to have both positive and negative impacts on aquatic and terrestrial biota. Organisms may become more or less sensitive to chemical pressures and the effects of these multiple stressors on ecosystem services are likely to become increasingly important in the future. Policy makers and industry around the world therefore need to begin to understand the implication of future changes on the risks of chemicals in the environment to ecosystem and human health so that, where necessary, they can begin to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies.
