South Australian Research and Development Institute (Aquatic Sciences), Adelaide, 20p", "abstract": "Many chemicals included in pharmaceutical and personal care products are pollutants that escape wastewater treatment and are discharged with effluents into receiving water bodies. Some of these chemicals persist in the environment, posing the risk of causing adverse effects to human health and aquatic ecosystems. Exposure has been associated with several toxicological effects in both flora and fauna, including disruption of the normal functioning of the endocrine system. Adelaide metropolitan waters receive approximately 72 gigalitres (GL) of wastewater effluents annually, discharged from three wastewater treatment plants spread over 50 km of coastline. The largest input comes from the Bolivar wastewater treatment plant, which discharges 46 GL into Barker Inlet. In this work, we investigated the occurrence of the persistent organic pollutants triclosan, methyl-triclosan and the steroid hormones estrone, 17\u03b2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:unp9ATQDT5gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15939609144207438500", "cites_id": ["15939609144207438500"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15939609144207438500&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pHINoxDeNN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
