In the state of New South Wales (NSW) Australia, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) is being used to reduce the volume and pathogen content of organic matter isolated from municipal waste. The product of this treatment, a compost-like output (CLO) referred to as mixed waste organic output (MWOO), is being recycled and applied as a soil amendment. However, the presence of contaminants in MWOO including trace organics, trace metals and physical contaminants such as microplastic fragments has raised concerns about potential negative effects on soil health and agriculture following land application. Here, we used multiple lines of evidence to examine the effects of land application of MWOO containing microplastics in three soils to a variety of terrestrial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17611141139064199199", "cites_id": ["17611141139064199199"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749118353326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H5gw445XZ_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 20, "2021": 41, "2022": 64, "2023": 33}}
