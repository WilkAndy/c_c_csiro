The volume is sectioned into eight main topics covering chemical synthesis, mode of action, environmental fate and residues, risk assessment and regulatory aspects. The first two chapters are the plenary lectures dealing with broader issues of food-environment challenge and essentially set the scene for the remaining sections of the book. The first paper deals with the question: How can technology feed the world safely and sustainably? Two aspects are discussed in detail: technological feasibility to feed the growing world population, and the impacts of political choices on adoption of technology. The paper highlights the challenges posed by the population growth, reaching 10 billion by 2040, requiring food production to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12444940382945982148", "cites_id": ["12444940382945982148"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12444940382945982148&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xLZomFdPtawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1}}
