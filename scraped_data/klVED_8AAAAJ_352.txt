Considering the variety of carbon-based sorbents, identifying the key sorbent properties responsible for PFASs removal from solution or immobilization in the soil can assist in the selection of the best sorbents for management of contaminated sites. This study evaluated the performance of 28 carbon-based sorbents including granular and powdered activated carbon (GAC and PAC), mixed mode carbon mineral material, biochars, and graphene-based materials (GNBs). The sorbents were characterized for a range of physical and chemical properties. PFASs' sorption from an AFFF-spiked solution was examined via a batch experiment, while their ability to immobilize PFASs in soil was tested following mixing, incubation and extraction using the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972301269X", "cites_per_year": {}}
