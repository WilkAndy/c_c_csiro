A concrete fire training pad with historical use of Ansulite and Lightwater AFFF formulations had PFAS concentrations measured to quantify spatial variability of PFAS within the pad. Surface chips and whole cores of concrete through to the underlying aggregate base were collected over the 24\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 m concrete pad and depth profiles of PFAS concentrations in nine cores were analysed. PFOS and PFHxS dominated the PFAS for surface samples, along the depth profile of cores and in the underlying plastic and aggregate material, with substantial variability in the concentrations of PFAS in the samples.
