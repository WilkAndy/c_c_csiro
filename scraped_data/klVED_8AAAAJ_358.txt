Where pollution is localized it is                                 described as point source (PS). Thus, PS pollution is a source of                                 pollution with a clearly identifiable point of discharge that can be                                 traced back to the specific source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429346132-56/pollution-point-sources-ravendra-naidu-mallavarapu-megharaj-peter-dillon-rai-kookana-ray-correll-wenzel", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bWgEy5NmYk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
