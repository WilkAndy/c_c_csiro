Despite the bulk of the human population living in Asia and Africa (mostly in low- or middle-income countries), limited work relating to research, development and regulations on APIs in the environment have so far been conducted in these regions. Also, the API manufacturing sector is gradually shifting to countries with lower production costs. This paper focuses mainly on APIs for human consumption and highlights key differences between the low-, middle- and high-income countries, covering factors such as population and demographics, manufacture, prescriptions, treatment, disposal and reuse of waste and wastewater. The striking differences in populations (both human and animal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4823449485339463387", "cites_id": ["4823449485339463387"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2013.0586", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2w6zTcBV8EIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 13, "2018": 29, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 17, "2023": 12}}
