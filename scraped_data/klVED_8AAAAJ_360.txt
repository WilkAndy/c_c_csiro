Project W12 Final Report to the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA)", "pub_year": 2020, "citation": "CSIRO, Canberra, 2020", "author": "SC Apte and M Williams and BM Angel and RS Kookana and JJ King and A Craig", "publisher": "CSIRO, Canberra", "abstract": "Coal seam gas (CSG) production has grown exponentially in Australia over the last two decades and it is estimated there are now around 19,000 productive wells in operation with several thousand more planned (OGIA, 2016). CSG extraction in Australia involves drilling a network of wells across the designated gas field to depths that intersect the target coal seams. The evolved gas is piped to the surface and then via distribution network to a local processing facility and then piped to coast facilities for liquefaction and overseas distribution. In order to increase the yield of methane, some wells undergo a stimulation process known as hydraulic fracturing (HF). Estimates suggest that around 10\u201040% of the wells in the Surat Basin will be hydraulically fractured during their 25 to 30 year lifetime (DES 2014)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Water-12-Milestone-7-final-report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8796IobxY4MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
