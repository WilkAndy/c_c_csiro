The over-pumping of groundwater in India is a serious issue. In 2016, almost 75% of groundwater in India were under stress with 54% area under high to extreme stress.\u2018Our Groundwater\u2019has been written as a resource book for use by students and teachers and for others in the community with an objective to enhance not only their awareness about the seriousness of groundwater over-exploitation in India but to empower students, teachers and community with practical information that could assist in solving this problem. The book deals with the issue of groundwater over-exploitation and management in a comprehensive manner, in that it offers information that is vital for both demand and supply management. We believe this is an important contribution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:37UQlXuwjP4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchdirect.westernsydney.edu.au/islandora/object/uws:59697/", "cites_per_year": {}}
