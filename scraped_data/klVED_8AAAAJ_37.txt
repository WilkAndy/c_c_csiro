Over the last 2 decades, global herbicide use has increased as farmers have shifted to more sustainable conservation tillage practices and have adopted herbicide-tolerant crop cultivars. The implications of increased herbicide use for soil biology are being questioned, but a comprehensive review on this topic is lacking. In this chapter we outline the chemistry and use of the major herbicide classes, and review the soil functions relevant to crop production. We then collate and critically evaluate the evidence for herbicide effects on soil biota and activity. In general, most studies suggest that the impacts of herbicide application on soil function are only minor and/or temporary. However, there are some instances where findings consistently suggest effects that could \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1817081405635228283", "cites_id": ["1817081405635228283"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211315001492", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e_LaPumRNxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 14, "2019": 14, "2020": 40, "2021": 29, "2022": 25, "2023": 7}}
