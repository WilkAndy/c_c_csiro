However, concerns about these chemicals have been growing due to their long-term persistence in the environment, potential for bioaccumulation and toxicity to human and ecological health. These concerns led the 3M Company in 2000 to start phasing out production of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related compounds (Krafft and Riess, 2015).A major factor controlling the fate and behaviour of chemicals in the environment is their phase partitioning between water and solid phases such as sorption to soils and sediments. Traditionally, organic matter in soils and sediments has been considered as the principal sorbent phase for nonionic organic contaminants. However, PFASs are characterized by a partial or fully fluorinated alkyl chain and a terminal functional group, which is negatively charged under environmental pH conditions. Consequently, the soil phases involved with sorption would be considered to extend beyond organic carbon (OC) alone and include any charged surfaces on mineral and organic phases in soils. This study investigated the effect of changing pH and surface charge on sorption behavior of three PFASs (PFOS, PFOA and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS)) in tropical soils."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ji7lAbPyDbYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/147603/3/147603%20-%20Proceedings-Natl.-Soil-Sci-Conf-Canberra.pdf#page=299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wZTXL5rgzXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
