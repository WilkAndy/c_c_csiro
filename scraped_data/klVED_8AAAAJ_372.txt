The accelerating and alarming rate of groundwater depletion continues unabated. In rural communities, groundwater decline constrains food production, jeopardises farm incomes, catalyses increased urban migration and fractures community cohesion and harmony. Groundwater scarcity also means rural women and girls are spending more time carrying water, more energy use and higher cost of pumping, increase in groundwater salinity and degradation of surface streams and dependent aquatic ecosystems. The project LWR/2010/015, Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention (MARVI), used a participatory and transdisciplinary approach at village level to engage farmers and other community members to monitor groundwater, rainfall and check dam water levels and use this information along with agronomic, social, economic and cultural aspects to develop capacity of villagers for sustainable groundwater management.The project employed methodology to engage and train villagers, called Bhujal Jankaars (BJs), a Hindi word meaning \u2018groundwater informed\u2019. BJs are local volunteers who were involved in developing village level science for community engagement and participatory groundwater management. With appropriate training and capacity building, BJs successfully monitored groundwater levels, rainfall, checkdam water levels and water quality, making sense from a village perspective of what is happening to village groundwater recharge and availability. BJs conveyed this information to farmers and others in their own \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/project-page-docs/final_report_lwr-2010-015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TZGP4xd4boUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
