In this study, the partitioning behavior of (\u00b9\u2074C)-C\u2086\u2080 aged up to 12 weeks was investigated in biosolids-amended soil. Spiked samples were subjected to sequential partitioning using water, methanol, and toluene followed by total combustion of solids; the distribution of \u00b9\u2074C across solvents and matrices were used to provide insights on C\u2086\u2080 behavior. In most samples, \u00b9\u2074C only partitioned in toluene with the remaining (non-extractable) activity detected in the solid phase. In all biosolids-amended soil samples, an increase in non-extractable \u00b9\u2074C were observed for those exposed to light (vs dark) with the greatest difference observed in biosolids + sand samples. Possible processes that contribute to the observed \u00b9\u2074C distribution, i.e. retention and potential transformation of C\u2086\u2080, were discussed. Over-all, results suggest that environmental exposure to C\u2086\u2080 and potentially transformed C\u2086\u2080 species, as a result of their release from soils, is likely to be low."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/117086", "cites_per_year": {}}
