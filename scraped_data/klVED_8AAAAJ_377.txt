Produced water also contains elevated concentrations of naturally occurring inorganic and organic compounds, and usually has a high salinity. Leaking of produced water from storage ponds may occur as a result of flooding or containment failure. A review of Australian coal seam gas literature has identified several contamination pathways from surface spills through soil and shallow groundwater to several potential receptors such as rivers, water bores, wetlands, stygofauna, etc.In this report, the fate of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and naturally occurring organic chemicals in soil as a result of unintentional release from storage ponds has been evaluated, and exposure pathways and relevant hydrobiogeochemical processes along such pathways reviewed. A collation of physico-chemical properties of organic contaminants served as input to a set of generic simulations of transport and attenuation in variably saturated soil profiles. Attenuation was simulated by means of a coupled equilibrium partitioning-first-order biodegradation model. The coupled processes of unsaturated flow, transport and attenuation in soil of selected contaminants that are associated with hydraulic fracturing fluids or that occur naturally in coal seams have then been modelled."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www2.pc-progress.com/Documents/Jirka/55_CSIRO_Organic_contaminants.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SUOWIRbJUBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
