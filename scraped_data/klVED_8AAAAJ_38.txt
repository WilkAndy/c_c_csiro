Furthermore, batch techniques generally used in kinetic studies do not represent field conditions. Flow techniques, on the other hand, closely represent pesticide transport and have many advantages over batch techniques. A flow technique was used to study the sorption kinetics of three pesticides in four Western Australian soils. Sorption data of all pesticides showed an initial rapid rate followed by a slower rate of sorption. While a first-order equation failed to satisfactorily describe the sorption data, both the Freundlich two-site kinetic equation and the parabolic diffusion law fitted well to the data. The rapid component of sorption varied from 0 to 25% of total sorption (24 h sorption value) for various pesticides. A comparison of sorption data obtained by a batch technique and a flow technique revealed that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13208664495708232448", "cites_id": ["13208664495708232448"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1992/09000/TIME_DEPENDENT_SORPTION_OF_PESTICIDES_DURING.5.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ANsAWGCaTrcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 5, "1994": 5, "1995": 9, "1996": 10, "1997": 8, "1998": 13, "1999": 7, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 1, "2006": 10, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
