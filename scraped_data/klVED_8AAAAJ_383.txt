Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the fate of nanoparticles (NPs) in waste streams. Being highly hydrophobic both C60 and CNTs are expected to concentrate in the sewage sludge (biosolids) during the treatment of sewage effluent. However, their release behaviour from sludge materials is unknown. Application of biosolids (treated sludge) as soil amendments/fertilizers, hence, presents another important route for NPs to be remobilized and enter the environment. In this study, we studied the release of fullerenes (C60) from biosolids spiked with different forms of fullerene nanoparticles (nC60) and applied to a wide range of soils. Results showed that varying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE02444987", "cites_per_year": {}}
