Multiple benefits of biochar in soil, such as potential sequestration of carbon in soil, the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, and improvement of soil fertility is increasingly being demonstrated in rapidly growing body of research on this topic. Consequently, soil amendment with certain types of biochars is being seen as a favourable option from agronomic and environmental standpoints. However, less attention has so far been paid towards the potential implication of soil amendment with biochar on the environmental fate and efficacy of soil applied pesticides (Kookana, 2010; Kookana et al. 2011). Due to their high specific surface areas, biochars in soils have been found to be very effective sorbents of organic compounds such as pesticides (Yu et al. 2006, 2010).
