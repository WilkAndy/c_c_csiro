The microbial role in the persistence of fenamiphos in soil was determined by comparing the relative rate of its degradation in autoclaved and unautoclaved soil. Nearly 80% of added fenamiphos disappeared in unautoclaved soil during a 20-day incubation. In autoclaved soil incubated under similar conditions the recovery of fenamiphos was about 91%. This indicates the involvement of microorganisms in the degradation of this compound. Fenamiphos in general was not toxic to the soil algal community and soil enzymes (dehydrogenase, phosphatase and \u03b2-glucosidase). Therefore fenamiphos at field application rates may not endanger non-target microorganisms and their activities in soil."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1279879880598543732", "cites_id": ["1279879880598543732"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071799000784", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dN0-ZvgLwxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 1, "2010": 11, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
