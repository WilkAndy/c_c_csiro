At the same time, work has been done on developing a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic model of Lake Wivenhoe. This paper reports on a preliminary assessment or how the hydrodynamic model can assist in predicting the health risks posed by pathogens and micropollutants in Wivenhoe Dam. The outcomes of this assessment demonstrated that there is potential for combining the hydrodynamic model with pathogen and chemical fate and behaviour data. The resulting successful combination could provide a powerful management tool for Seqwater and regulators."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16269174523158734955&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ayi28Qe4x-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
