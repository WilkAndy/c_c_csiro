We present a theoretical basis for scaling data for pesticide application to the topsoil on a large number of farm fields up to watershed scale water quality. At the field scale the pesticide application is assumed to be a pulse input, with a distribution of application times over the season. For a large number of farms, the total mass in the topsoil at any time is represented by a convolution integral taking into account the distribution of inputs and applying first order decay. This enables the calculation of average mass, residual mass at the end of the season, and maximum mass of pesticide in the watershed. Runoff is assumed to occur after a threshold of 50 mm of rainfall or irrigation, and a simple \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFM.H53H1515K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
