The published reviews on biochar application to soil have so far focused mainly on the agronomic benefits, and have paid little attention to the potential unintended effects. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a balanced perspective on the agronomic and environmental impacts of biochar amendment to soil. The chapter highlights the physical and chemical characteristics of biochar, which can impact on the sorption, hence efficacy and biodegradation, of pesticides. As a consequence, weed control in biochar-amended soils may prove more difficult as preemergent herbicides may be less effective. Since biochars are often prepared from a variety of feedstocks (including waste materials), the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 713, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4106096062933539221,6470577055654364412", "cites_id": ["4106096062933539221", "6470577055654364412"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855381000032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lZnIPJ3I-zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 21, "2013": 29, "2014": 55, "2015": 73, "2016": 65, "2017": 76, "2018": 60, "2019": 70, "2020": 81, "2021": 81, "2022": 69, "2023": 25}}
