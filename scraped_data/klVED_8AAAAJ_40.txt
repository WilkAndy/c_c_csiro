The biochar was added to soils at 0%, 0.5% and 1.0% (w/w) and the herbicides were applied to those soil-biochar mixes at nil, half, full, two times, and four times, the recommended dosage (H4). Annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) was grown in biochar amended soils for 1month. Biochar had a positive impact on ryegrass survival rate and above-ground biomass at most of the application rates, and particularly at H4. Within any given biochar treatment, increasing herbicide application decreased the survival rate and fresh weight of above-ground biomass. Biomass production across the biochar treatment gradient significantly differed (p<0.01) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9106611528734849688", "cites_id": ["9106611528734849688"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653511006229", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mLq3ve8uYX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 11, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
