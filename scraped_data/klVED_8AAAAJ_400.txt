GMW region covers 68,000 square kilometres from the Great Dividing Range north to the River Murray and from Corryong down river to Nyah near Swan Hill.In the irrigation areas along the lower Goulburn and Murray Rivers, G-MW conveys water to and from customers\u2019 properties via earthen channels or drains. These channels and drains can become choked with a variety of aquatic plants. G-MW commonly uses herbicides, mainly glyphosate, amitrole, 2, 4-D amine, acrolein, dalapon and imazapyr to control aquatic plants in the irrigation channels, drains and natural carriers so that normal water flow can be maintained. While application of these herbicides is aimed to control targeted plants species, there remains a possibility of potential harm to other non-targeted species if the applications are not properly managed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7963487295242960386&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Av5KroD9g24J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
