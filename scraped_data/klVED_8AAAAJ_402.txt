An example of NPSP includes aerial transport and deposition of contaminants such as SO2 from industrial emissions leading to acidification of soil and water bodies. Rain water in urban areas could also be a source of NPSP as it may concentrate organic and inorganic contaminants. Examples of such contaminants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls that could be present in urban air due to road traffic, domestic heating, industrial emissions, agricultural treatments, etc.[1\u20133] Other examples of NPSP include fertilizer (especially Cd, N, and P) and pesticide applications to improve crop yield. Use of industrial waste materials as soil amendments have been estimated to contaminate thousands of hectares of productive agricultural land in countries throughout the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6771410405546593647&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bw39KuPh-F0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
