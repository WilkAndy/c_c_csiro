The Murrumbidgee, Coleambally and Murray irrigation areas of southern New South Wales are among world\u2019s most productive and efficient rice growing regions. Australian rice growers contend with relatively fewer pests (invertebrates and weeds) than overseas growers, partly due to the climatic conditions and field crop rotations (Rice Growers Association of Australia Inc., 2003). However, pesticides are still being commonly applied to Australian rice fields.Pesticides applied in rice bays may partition between soil and the water phases depending on their chemical properties, such as solubility in water. Some pesticides have the tendency to concentrate in soil solid phase and in the surface soil layers. Chlorpyrifos, for example, shows strong binding affinity to soil particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/34777943/07-024.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:19Tg5HxHhegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
