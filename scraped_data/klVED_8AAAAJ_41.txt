Of the four selected plants viz., rye grass (Lolium perenne), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacae), Pennisetum (Pennisetum clandestinum) and a spring onion (Allium sp.) used in this study, only P. clandestinum was able to survive in herbicide contaminated soil while other plants died within few days after germination/transplanting. Both atrazine and simazine were degraded at a faster rate in contaminated soil planted to P. clandestinum than in unplanted soil. Within 80 days, nearly 45% and 52% of atrazine and simazine, respectively, were degraded in soil planted to P. clandestinum while only 22% and 20% of the respective herbicide were degraded in the unplanted soil.
