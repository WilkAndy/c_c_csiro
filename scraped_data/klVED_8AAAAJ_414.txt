The legacy of contaminated sites globally and the potential risks associated with these are well known issues. Governments and their agencies are coming under increasing pressure to ensure that our environment is safe from contamination at these sites.It has long been recognised that it is not feasible to have a \u201cno risk environment.\u201d It has also been acknowledged that the complete removal of all contaminants is prohibitively expensive and not always needed. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) seeks to quantify the risk posed by particular contaminants in the environment. In the cost: benefit framework, ERA is, therefore, an attractive tool for informed decision making and it is increasingly being applied globally. This Special Issue of Human and Ecological Risk Assessment (HERA) is a collection of invited papers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10807030500428546", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x3quPASrkYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
