The National Environment Protection (Assessment of Site Contamination) Measure (1999)(the NEPM) for and the Resource Management Act (1991)(the RMA) are the two major pieces of legislation that govern the assessment and treatment of contaminated sites in Australia and New Zealand respectively. The NEPM has two major components relating to ecological risks. The first is a set of environmental investigation levels (EILs) for soils that are to be used to determine whether a site warrants further investigation. Those sites with concentrations below the EIL do not require further work. If however, they are exceeded then either management action in the form of remediation or site-specific investigation in the form of further chemical analyses and toxicity testing is triggered. Due to a lack of appropriate data only phytotoxicity investigation levels (PILs) with limited application for urban lands (specifically sandy loams with a pH of 6\u20138) could be developed. The second component is a recommended process for conducting ecological risk assessments of contaminated sites for those sites that exceed the EILs. The recommended process is based on the Environment Canada framework. Contaminated site assessments in New Zealand rely upon non-statutory soil criteria available in three industry-based guidelines, or where appropriate soil criteria (including those protective of ecological receptors) are not available overseas soil criteria (such as those in the NEPM) are applied.
