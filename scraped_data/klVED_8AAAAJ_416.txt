However, the potential adverse impact of pesticide use on ecosystem and human health continues to be a cause of concern. To minimise any such effects, sound understanding of environmental fate and behaviour of pesticides under local soil and environmental conditions is essential. Indeed, in last 20-30 years, a substantial body of research on the fate and behaviour of pesticides has been developed. This, however, originates predominantly from the temperate soils of Europe and North America. Despite the fact that large number and volumes of pesticides are used in tropical countries, the environmental fate of pesticides (especially modern pesticides) in the tropics remains poorly understood (Racke, 2003).The combinations of chemical properties as well as site-specific soil and environmental conditions deter-mine the environmental fate and behaviour of a pesticide. Soil and environmental conditions vary markedly with geographical locations. Soil properties such as soil pH, abundance and nature of clay minerals, sesquioxides and soil organic matter can be vastly different in soils of different agroclimatic regions. For example, many soils of semi-a-rid tropical countries (eg parts of India, Pakistan China and Australia) are alkaline (pH> 8.0), whereas highly weathered soils of the tropics (Malaysia and Australia) and those in high rainfall areas are acidic (pH 5.5\u20136.5). Many soils of the a-rid zone and tropical countries are low in SOM content, whereas the volcanic soils, such as in New Zealand and Japan, are rich in allophone clay and contain much higher organic matter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.agritech.tnau.ac.in/pdf/persagres.pdf#page=417", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pc_F6AApZkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
