During ASR, attenuation processes such as sorption and degradation may play an important role in removing trace organic contaminants in injected waste water. This study mainly investigated the role of treated sewage effluent injectant (the waste water injected into the aquifer) on degradation of two endocrine disrupting compounds, 17\u00df-estradiol (E2) and 17o-ethynylestradiol (EE2), in the laboratory by comparing their behavior in incubation media-aquifer sediment/ground water slurry from the Bolivar experimental ASR site in South Australia and sediment/effluent slurry. Biodegradation of the two com-pounds in the sediment/ground water media (1: 1, w/w) and in the sediment/effluent media (1: 1, w/w) were conducted under aer-obic and anaerobic conditions at 20 C. In both incubation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7291377490728689703&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J6ApSjItMGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
