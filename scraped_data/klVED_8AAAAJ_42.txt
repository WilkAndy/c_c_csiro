The PFASs studied include perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs), perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs), fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSs), nonionic perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs), cyclic PFAS (PFEtCHxS), per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids (GenX, ADONA, 9Cl-PF3ONS), and three aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF)-related zwitterionic PFASs (AmPr-FHxSA, TAmPr-FHxSA, 6:2 FTSA-PrB). Soil\u2013water partitioning coefficients (log\u202fKd values) of the PFASs ranged from less than zero to approximately three, were chain-length-dependent, and were significantly linearly related to molecular weight (MW) for PFASs with MW > 350 g/mol (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.0001). Across all soils, the Kd values of all short-chain PFASs (\u22645 \u2212CF2\u2013 moieties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3288089806543613892", "cites_id": ["3288089806543613892"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c05705", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xG-dDEKkoS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 24, "2022": 60, "2023": 35}}
