It provides a reference source on various techniques available for assessing contaminant bioavailability by presenting detailed chapters on fundamental principles governing contaminant bioavailability, indicators of bioavailability and potential implications of bioavailability to environmental and human health. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the impact of high bioavailability to ecosystem health. Specific topics include: bioavailability, toxicity and risk relations; the role of chemical speciation in bioavailability; microbial parameters as indicators of toxic effects of heavy metals; contamination from mining and effects of bioavailable contaminants on freshwater biota; groundwater arsenic contamination-a case study on the bioavailability of geogenic arsenic; and inplace inactivation of bioavailable metals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4aZ_i-5WJEQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043001646", "cites_per_year": {}}
