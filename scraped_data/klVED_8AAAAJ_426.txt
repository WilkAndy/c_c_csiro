It is a major human health hazard due to its potential accumulation in kidneys leading to kidney dysfunction (Alloway, 1990). Both natural and anthropogenic activities are important sources of Cd to the soil environment. Sources include atmospheric fallout from metallurgical industries, application of sewage sludge or other waste containing Cd on land, and use of phosphatic fertilizers in agricultural areas. The result is substantial Cd accumulation in soil, providing the source for plant uptake, as well as leaching of Cd under certain soil and environmental conditions (Alloway, 1990; Naidu et al., 1997). The mean concentrations of Cd in agricultural soil are generally less than 0.4 mg/kg (Alloway, 1990), with a maximum up to 3 mg/kg. Highly contaminated soils can, how-ever, contain Cd concentrations up to 10 mg/kg or even more (e. g., Hornburg and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=H2Ak9lkL_fEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA59&dq=info:-E6n3L9u95gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=OzKLrtOh5s&sig=9C7ln9dw_9H3RjX3kMlqNv_MwpM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-E6n3L9u95gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
