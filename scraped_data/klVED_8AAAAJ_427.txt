Specifically: (1) the pesticide dilemma - why the problem arose; (2) integrated pest management (IPM) - what strategies are needed for the future; (3) solutions - how multidisciplinary research can help solve the pesticide dilemma; and (4) implementation - how to reconcile the economic and environmental objectives. The Physicochemical Evaluation of the Environment (PETE) program predicted the organic carbon partition coefficient (K{sub oc}) and the half-lives of atrazine and pirimicarb within an order of magnitude. Random samples of 247 pesticides drawn from a total of 585 were classified by oral LD{sub 50} to the rat, sorption (K{sub oc}) and the half-life in soil. Although atrazine and pirimicarb fell in the orange zone, hazard assessment and long term simulations identified strategies to reduce risk. Quality assurance programmes such as the International Standards Organization report ISO 14,000 offer a framework within which these objectives can be achieved. 46 refs, 6 figs, 2 tabs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/486897", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NVIAHnRZ02UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
