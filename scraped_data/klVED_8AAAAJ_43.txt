We undertook a longitudinal survey of the Ahar River for a number of emerging organic contaminants (including pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products and industrial chemicals) which flows through the city of Udaipur, India. Udaipur is a city of approximately 450,000 people with no wastewater treatment occurring at the time of this survey. We found the concentrations of many of the contaminants within the river water were similar to those commonly reported in untreated wastewater in high income countries. For example, concentrations of pharmaceuticals, such as carbamazepine, antibiotics and non-steroidal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12192019847234526674", "cites_id": ["12192019847234526674"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971833050X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0h3teHTBMqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 16, "2020": 24, "2021": 32, "2022": 31, "2023": 16}}
