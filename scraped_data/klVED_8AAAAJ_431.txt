To describe pollutant behaviour in soils, a variety of solute transport models have been proposed in recent years. These models vary in conceptual approach and degree of complexity, however, rarely include the scale of heterogeneity of soil properties encountered in the field. During simulation of solute transport whilst some processes are usually considered in a greater detail, the soil profile is generally taken as uniform in terms of flow and other soil physical and chemical properties. Behaviour of numerous chemicals is governed by soil properties such as soil organic matter, pH clay content, permeability, etc. which vary markedly with depth in soils. Therefore, it is important to establish both the depth-wise distribution of these properties within a soil profile and the functional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.748448596246881", "cites_per_year": {}}
