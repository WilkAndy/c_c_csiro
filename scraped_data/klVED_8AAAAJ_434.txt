However, its application has been inhibited by insufficient understanding of the effectiveness of added soil sorbents over time. Herein, we present results on effectiveness of select carbon-based sorbents with different properties, under long-term dry storage over 4 years (longevity) and multiple laboratory leaching conditions (durability). Reduction of leaching of a range of PFAS from contaminated soils was tested using 2 powdered activated carbon (AC) sorbents, 1 colloidal AC, and 2 biochars applied at 1-6%. Standard batch leaching tests simulating aggressive, worst-case scenario conditions for leaching were employed to test longevity and durability of stabilisation in clayey and sandy soils at concentrations typical of contaminated sites (2 and 14 mg/kg perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS). The different sorbents reduced leaching of PFAS from the soils, albeit to varying degrees. Among the 5 sorbents, 2 powdered AC and 1 biochar were initially able to reduce leaching of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and PFOS by at least 95%. Aging for 4 years did not significantly affect the performance of the powdered AC sorbents with respect to PFAS leaching, though an improvement was observed in the soils treated with colloidal AC, reaching close to 95% reduction in leachable PFHxS, PFOS and PFOA. The AC-treated soils also appeared to be durable\u2013still achieving at least 95% reduction in leaching under repetitive leaching events and with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:M0leSnx2MbUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4312946", "cites_per_year": {}}
