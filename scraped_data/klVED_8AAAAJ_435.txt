This book, with 21 chapters by 57 accomplished international researchers, reports on the recent advances of biochar research and the global status of biochar application. Scientific findings, uncertainties, and barriers to practice of biochar amendment for sustaining soil fertility, improving crop production, promoting animal performance, remediating water and land, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are synthesized. The book presents a whole picture of biochar in its production, characterization, application, and development. Agricultural and Environmental Applications of Biochar: Advances and Barrier highlights the mechanisms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaspecpub63", "cites_per_year": {}}
