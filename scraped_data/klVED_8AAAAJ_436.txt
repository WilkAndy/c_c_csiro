We studied the degradation and microbial toxicity of selected HF chemical components including two biocides (methylisothiozolinone-MIT, chloromethylisothiozolinone-CMIT), a gel-breaker aid (triethanolamine-TEA), and three geogenic chemicals (phenol, m-cresol and p-cresol) in ultrapure water, HF fluid and produced water in five different soil types (surface and subsurface soils). The degradation of the two biocides and three geogenic chemicals was rapid in all soils treated with ultrapure water or produced water (DT50 values< 2 days in surface soils). In contrast, the loss of TEA was much slower in soils, especially in those treated with HF fluid (DT50> 30 days). Sorption coefficients (Koc in L/Kg) measured in these soils ranged from 71 to 733 for TEA, 64-408 for MIT and 11-72 for CMIT. In terms of soil microbial toxicity, exposure to HF fluid and produced water reduced microbial respiration, albeit temporarily. The overall microbial activities in surface soils contaminated with produced water had fully recovered in most soils. In contrast, the HF fluid addition to soils completely inhibited the nitrification in all soils, with little recovery over the 60 day experimental period. In the case of produced water exposure, three out of five surface soils showed complete recovery in nitrification during the study period. The functional genes for nitrogen fixation (nifH) and carbon cycling (GA1) and microbial community composition (16S rRNA) were significantly affected by HF fluid in some soils. Overall, the study shows that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4088204", "cites_per_year": {}}
