Existing laboratory leaching methods have limitations when assessing in situ leaching in the field and for PFAS-impacted-soil reuse and disposal options. For 37 aged field soils from five sites historically contaminated with PFAS over decades, we assess leaching of PFAS using new and existing laboratory leaching methods to providing alternative methods for evaluating PFAS leaching under a simulated range of leaching conditions and scenarios. The dominant PFAS in the soils were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, and perfluorohexanoic acid with less perfluorooctanoic acid. The new leaching tests including intact soil core leaching (Exp 1), saturate-spin (Exp 2), and saturate-tumble-spin (Exp 3), were compared to the standard Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP, Exp 4) and the Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF, Exp 5). The leach tests varied in terms of the liquid: soil ratio, the tumbling (agitation) time and the pH of the starting solution, with LEAF-1313 conducted across seven pHs (2-12). Correlations between leachate and soil concentrations were the highest for Exp 4 and Exp 5 (R 2= 0.72-0.98) and lowest for Exp 3 (R 2= 0.53). Correlations between leachate and soil concentrations from soil core leaching tests were very poor. The PFAS mass leached as a fraction of the total increased as the leaching method went from least to most aggressive: soil core leaching (27%)< saturate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ijdKiLOsEJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3995255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pj3acxYNx-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
