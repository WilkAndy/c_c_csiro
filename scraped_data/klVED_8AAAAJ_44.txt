The herbicides have become popular because of their low application rates (10-40 g/ha), low mammalian toxicity, and unprecedented herbicidal activity. We present a review of the fate and behaviour of these herbicides in soils with particular reference to alkaline soils of Australia. The review shows that the low application rates of sulfonylurea herbicides continue to present an analytical challenge, although in recent years a number of new methods capable of detecting them at very low concentrations have been developed. A range of analytical methods is available, including high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, immunoassay, and bioassay. However, analytical sensitivity required to detect trace levels of these herbicides continues to pose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9167936941711661519,12812200195349761883", "cites_id": ["9167936941711661519", "12812200195349761883"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/A97131", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z5nnHRMOO38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 7, "2002": 7, "2003": 7, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 10, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
