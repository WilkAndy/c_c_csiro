Dittmar, K. Pfaffelmoser, T. R\u00f6tzer, W. Elling Water balance calculations can be used to estimate long-term O 3 uptake at the stand level and in combination with tree-ring data to derive new critical threshold values.

Gadella A sampling strategy that ensures analytical results representative of the mean concentration in soil stockpiles is presented and validated. 13 Mercury transfer from fish carcasses to scavengers in boreal lakes: the use of stable isotopes of mercury J.
