Federal and State governments responded by stating that guidelines would be established to prevent this reoccurring. The Fertiliser Working Group was established and given the task of ensuring this occurred. A three phase project was developed and CSIRO employed to undertake the first phase\u2013a Scoping Study. The Scoping Study outlined a framework for the second and third phases. Following a tender process, CSIRO was employed to conduct Phase Two. This presentation will outline the methods to be used in conducting Phase Two and how FIFA and its members can facilitate this. The interaction between the project team and FIFA and its members will be vital to the success of Phase Two of the Contaminants in Fertiliser Project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bd14b85ee5cd68bf8d3a293ec03aecd51c9d6b3e", "cites_per_year": {}}
