Biodegradation of five EDCs (BPA, E2, EE2, 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP) in a loam soil associated with wastewater reuse. We also characterized the biotransformation of E2 to E1 in the loam soil under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The sorption of the seven EDCs on soil were in the following order: 4-n-NP> 4-t-OP> EE2> E2> E1> E3> BPA. This sorption test suggests that BPA is most mobile, estrogens are moderately mobile and alkylphenols are least mobile in the soils. Under aerobic biologically active soil systems, all five EDCs including the degradation product E1 were degraded rapidly within seven days in these laboratory experiments. However, under anaerobic conditions in the soil, little or no degradation of the five EDCs was noted except for E2, which showed slow degradation during the 70-day study. The calculated half-lives for E2 under anaerobic conditions were 24 days in the soil. E2 was found to be biotransformed to E1 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The present study clearly demonstrated that for the degradation of the five EDCs aerobic conditions are more favorable than anaerobic conditions. The study also showed that the five EDCs (BPA, E2, EE2, 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP) as well as E1, which are commonly present in reclaimed wastewater, are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14177362732772248021&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
