Understanding of their fate and behaviour in soil is crucial for a proper assessment of their potential risk and impact on environment. Organic contaminants in soils undergo a range of processes, namely sorption, desorption, sequestration and ageing; all of which help immobilize the compounds in soils rendering them progressively less bioavailable with time. While these phenomena have been known for decades now, the bioavailability of organic contaminants is relatively rarely taken into account during risk assessment. Substantial new knowledge in literature provides new opportunities to do so. Recent research on interactions of organic contaminants with certain fractions of organic carbon in soils has shed new light on the inadequacy of simple partitioning as a mechanism of contaminant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asssi/supersoil2004/s3/oral/1780_kookanar.htm", "cites_per_year": {}}
