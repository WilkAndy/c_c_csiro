Leaching of Cd through soil profiles has implications for both its accumulation in subsoil or contamination of ground-water. We measured adsorption and transport of Cd in the presence of Ca and Na salts of varying ionic strengths using batch and miscible displacement techniques. Two variable charge soils, an Oxisol and an Alfisol, were used in this study. The Alfisol, despite its lower clay content, showed an adsorption coefficient (K) that was four times higher than the clay-rich Oxisol. Such a difference in adsorption was attributed to the presence of 2:1 layer silicate minerals in the Alfisol and the consequent high surface negative charge density. In column experiments, a marked effect of ionic strength on the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of Cd was observed when the concentrations of NaNO3 were increased from 0.03 M to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11367114979588148503", "cites_id": ["11367114979588148503"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706197001316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F41fL9kawJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 11, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
