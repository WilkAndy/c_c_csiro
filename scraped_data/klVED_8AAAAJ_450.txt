Governments and their agencies are increasingly being expected to intervene to ensure adequate protection of ecosystem and human health from potential exposure to the pollutant chemicals at contaminated sites. Risk assessment is an attractive tool for better measuring and understanding the nature and extent of the risk posed by the contaminants and for informed decision-making about potential mitigation strategies. Human health risk assessment has been the primary focus of early applications of risk assessment approaches (Rechard 1999).
