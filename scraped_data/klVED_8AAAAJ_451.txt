Sorption of the pesticides was measured using the standard batch equilibrium procedure at a 1: 5 soil/solution ratio. Sorption isotherms of the pesticides were essentially linear. Depending on the soil, the sorption coefficients (Kd) of ametryn, carbaryl, and phosalone ranged from 0.59 to 4.30, 1.9 to 59.67 and 21.2 to 1182.0 L kg-1, respectively demonstrating a wide range of variation in sorptive capacities of these soils. The variation in Kd could not be explained on the basis of organic matter content of soils. When sorption was normalized with organic C, the variation decreased to 3-fold, 17-fold and 27-fold for ametryn, carbaryl and phosalone, respectively. The significant variation in Koc reflects the importance of chemical nature of soil organic matter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7105686961576400456&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SNbi3aR4nGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
