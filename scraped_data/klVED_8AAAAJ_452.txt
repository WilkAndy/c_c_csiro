Wastewater effluents from WWTPs contain toxic inorganic, organic chemicals and pathogens and can potentially pose risks to the environment and public health and therefore need careful management. An emerging water quality issue is endocrine disrupting chemicals. Studies were undertaken to assess sorption of 7 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), namely, estrone (E1), 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2), bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octyl phenol (4-t-OP) and 4-n-nonyl phenol (4-n-NP) on four different soils and biodegradation of five EDCs (BPA, E2, EE2, 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP) in a loam soil associated with wastewater reuse. We also characterized the biotransformation of E2 to E1 in the loam soil under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Sorption test demonstrated that alkylphenols (4-t-OP and 4-n-NP) had strongest sorption onto soils, followed by estrogens (EE2, E2, E1, E3) and BPA. This laboratory study showed that all five EDCs including the degradation product E1 were degraded rapidly in the soil within 7 days under aerobic conditions. However, under anaerobic conditions in the soil, little or no degradation of the five EDCs was noted except for E2, which showed slow degradation during the 70-day study. The calculated half-lives for E2 under anaerobic conditions were 24 days in the soil. E2 was found to be biotransformed to E1 under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The study suggested that the five EDCs as well as E1, which may be present in reclaimed wastewater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5592319777705745988&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
