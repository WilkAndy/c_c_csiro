The aims of this study were to investigate how management practises and topography influence the variability of key soil properties and to test the efficacy of various analytical techniques for predictive high resolution soil mapping. We sampled soil properties measured in an intensively managed orchard in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia using a stratified sampling design for alleys and tree-lines in order to distinguish potential management effects (extrinsic factors) from effects of natural soil variability (intrinsic factors). Key soil properties were determined using standard techniques and predictions using mid-infrared partial least-squares (MIR-PLS). Total organic carbon and electrical conductivity (EC) were significantly lower in the tree-line than in the alley. The distribution of coarse fraction (>2mm) was also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6816071960545017667", "cites_id": ["6816071960545017667"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816212000136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qz_Jw1WNl14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 11, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 17, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
