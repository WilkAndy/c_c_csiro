Biodegradation experiments were conducted in microcosms with aquifer material and groundwater mixture, or with aquifer material and effluent mixture in the presence of glucose under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. All five selected compounds were degraded by microorganisms in both types of aquifer material\u2013water mixtures under aerobic and anoxic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, EE2 was found to degrade faster in the aquifer material supplemented with effluent with a half-life of 15 days compared with that of 26 days in the aquifer material and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1249443694727993365", "cites_id": ["1249443694727993365"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135407005726", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FRgdp2vqVhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 14, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
