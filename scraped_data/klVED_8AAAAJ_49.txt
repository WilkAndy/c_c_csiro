However, the environment fate data on pesticide metabolites are relatively meagre. We report the sorption and degradation behaviour of chlorpyrifos and its primary metabolite, TCP (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol), with depth in 2 Australian soil profiles. Sorption isotherms were determined by batch equilibrium method and the degradation was studied under controlled incubation conditions. Sorption of chlorpyrifos (Kd = 40.3\u2013209.6 L/kg) was found to be about 100 times higher than that of TCP (Kd = 0.45\u20132.86 L/kg) in both the soil profiles. A significant correlation (r2 = 0.88**) was found between sorption of chlorpyrifos and the soil organic carbon content, but not in the case of TCP. However, in the case of TCP a significant inverse relationship was observed with pH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16915406521487241883", "cites_id": ["16915406521487241883"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr02062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m7KSEJyYv-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
