These BTC's were successfully described only when the bicontinuum approach of two sites/two regions was used with the convective-dispersive equation. The models using this approach need two additional parameters (namely fraction of type-1 sites or mobile phase \u0192, and the rate parameter for type-2 sites or immobile phase \u03b1) and these are generally obtained by curve-fitting procedures. However, considering the importance of independent measurement of input parameters for the numerical simulation of these BTC's, the rate parameters describing the time-dependent behaviour of simazine sorption were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4872465260994170348", "cites_id": ["4872465260994170348"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016977229390033O", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7A395VZ5nkMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 1, "1996": 8, "1997": 8, "1998": 6, "1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 8, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
