Biochars were added at the rates of 5% and 10% in the co-composting and 10% and 20% in the incubation experiment. The rates of biochar had no consistent effect on the change in element contents of composted- or incubated-biochars. The biochar C demonstrated recalcitrance in both composting and incubation systems. Composting increased the CEC of biochars probably due to thermophilic oxidation. The increases in CEC of WS and CL were 6.5 and 2.2 times, respectively, for composting. Translocation of elements, between biochar and compost medium, occurred in both directions. In most cases, biochars gained elements under the influence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15160725601659975563", "cites_id": ["15160725601659975563"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653515005287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i_ccGJy3ZdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 16, "2018": 17, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 23, "2023": 11}}
