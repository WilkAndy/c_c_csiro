Systematic methods of the assessment of potential risk of pesticides to environmental components can serve as valuable tools in decision making and policy formulation. Simple risk indicators have been developed which cover a range of scenarios such as toxicity to organisms, health of farm workers, consumer health, and residues in harvested produce. The authors have developed a software package named Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) that outputs an improved pesticide risk indicator for water quality. PIRI is a standalone, user-friendly, platform-independent program. It can be used to (i) rank pesticides in terms of their relative pollution potential to groundwater or surface water, and (ii) to compare different land uses in a catchment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6590675866835536404", "cites_id": ["6590675866835536404"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11267-005-7397-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FMp4MMjIdlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 9, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
