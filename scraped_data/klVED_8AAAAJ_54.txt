Degradation rates of eight pesticides used commonly in Western Australia-chlorpyriphos, chlorthal dimethyl, fenamiphos, linuron, metalaxyl, metribuzin, prometryne and propyzamide-in the surface (0-25 cm) and subsurface (25-50 cm) layers of a sandy soil, were studied under controlled incubation conditions and were compared with those under field conditions. Field degradation rates were also simulated on the basis of degradation rates measured in the laboratory, taking into account the effects of temporal variations in field moisture and temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15099484041957618950", "cites_id": ["15099484041957618950"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Fulltext/1998/05000/DEGRADATION_RATES_OF_EIGHT_PESTICIDES__IN_SURFACE.8.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BjWQVLwkjNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
