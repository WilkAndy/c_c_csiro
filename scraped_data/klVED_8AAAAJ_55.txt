The TCS compound can survive the treatment process and is often present in the sewage effluent and biosolids. We investigated the impact of TCS upon selected microbiological and biochemical parameters in two contrasting Australian soils. Substrate\u2010induced respiration and nitrification, plus activities of four enzymes (relevant for carbon and nitrogen turnover), were measured using Organisation for Economic Co\u2010operation and Development protocols after exposing soils to TCS at concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg of soil. Respiration in the sandy soil was not affected by the addition of TCS, but in clay soil it decreased to TCS at 50 mg/kg of soil. The nitrification process was affected in both soils. In the sandy soil, TCS showed a negative effect on the nitrate and nitrite production at 5 mg/kg.
