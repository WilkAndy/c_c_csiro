Occurrence of sorption losses of PFAS analytes onto particular laboratory-ware (e.g. glass containers) has been suggested in the published literature but has not been investigated in detail. We examined sorption losses from aqueous PFOA solutions in contact with different commonly-used materials in filter units and centrifuge tubes (glass and plastics). Sorption of PFOA onto different filter membrane types ranged from 21\u201379% indicating that filtration can introduce a major source of error in PFOA analysis; pre-treatment of filter membranes with phosphate or methanol solutions did not improve PFOA recovery. Substantial adsorption of PFOA was also observed on tubes made from polypropylene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4540228700957541932", "cites_id": ["4540228700957541932"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653519301031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LIabx_IhAj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 16, "2021": 28, "2022": 27, "2023": 17}}
