The last half-century has witnessed a rapid increase in the regional population, agricultural productivity, industrial activities and trade within the region.

This volume presents an overview of the fate of contaminants in the soil environment; current soil management factors used to control contaminant impacts, issues related to sludge and effluent disposals in the soil environment; legal, health and social impacts of contaminated land, remediation approaches and strategies to manage contaminated land, some of the problems associated with environmental degradation in the Australasia-Pacific Region and steps that we need to take to safeguard our environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11274456927832135331,15534406312844348482", "cites_id": ["11274456927832135331", "15534406312844348482"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YR_-CAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:o1bgWtfqdpwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=t75EOEBHKP&sig=kdbGBk7J2yXMhbwPZhzldrNcB6E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o1bgWtfqdpwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
