Environmental monitoring programs of surface and ground waters in the tropics, including areas of high ecological value, have detected several relatively polar pesticides at concentrations that are of ecological concern. Novel monitoring techniques have the capacity to reveal the spatial and temporal extent of such risks. To best manage these pesticides, their sorption, dissipation rates, leaching, and runoff potential need to be better understood. On these aspects, important insights have been provided by several studies within this issue. Improved understanding of the environmental fate, effects, and risks through studies presented in this special issue is crucial for minimizing the nontarget impacts of pesticides on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18348001953650233685", "cites_id": ["18348001953650233685"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01320", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VdF-oZAyof4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 24, "2022": 20, "2023": 5}}
