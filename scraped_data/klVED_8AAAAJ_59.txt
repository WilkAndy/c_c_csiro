Bioavailability, remobilization and fate of Cd entering in soils are usually controlled by adsorption\u2013desorption reactions on Fe oxides. Adsorption of Cd on soil colloids including Fe oxides has been extensively studied but Cd desorption from such soil minerals has received relatively little attention. Some factors that affect Cd adsorption on goethite include pH, temperature, aging, type of index cations, Cd concentrations, solution ionic strength and presence of organic and inorganic ions. This research was conducted to study the influence of pH, temperature and aging on Cd desorption from goethite. Batch experiments were conducted to evaluate Cd desorption from goethite with 0.01M Ca(NO3)2. In these experiments Cd desorption was observed at 20, 40 and 70\u00b0C in combination with aging for 16h, 30, 90 and 180d from goethite that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=538664476887665282", "cites_id": ["538664476887665282"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505012476", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gsoC3ny4eQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 13, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
