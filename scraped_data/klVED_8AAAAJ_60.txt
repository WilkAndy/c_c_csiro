In recent times, there has been an increasing realization that not only the amount, but also the chemical composition, of organic matter can influence the sorption properties of a soil. Here, we show that the organic carbon-normalized sorption coefficient (KOC) for diuron is 27\u201381% higher in 10 A11 horizons than in 10 matching A12 horizons for soils collected from a small (2ha) field. KOC was generally greater for the deeper (B) horizons, although these values may be inflated by sorption of diuron to clays. Organic matter chemistry of the A11 and A12 horizons was determined using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. KOC was positively correlated with aryl C (r2=0.59, significance level 0.001) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r2=0.84, significance level <0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2026612324899329361", "cites_id": ["2026612324899329361"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653507010892", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UZUNCyz5HxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 13, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
