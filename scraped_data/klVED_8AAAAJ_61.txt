In addition, contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are known to be present in the marine environments of the GBR and the adjacent Torres Strait (TS). Current and projected agricultural, urban and industrial developments are likely to increase the sources and diversity of CECs being released into these marine ecosystems. In this review, we evaluate the sources, presence and potential effects of six different categories of CECs known to be present, or likely to be present, in the GBR and TS marine ecosystems. Specifically, we summarize available monitoring, source and effect information for antifouling paints; coal dust and particles; heavy/trace metals and metalloids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9333663068661249076", "cites_id": ["9333663068661249076"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719351320", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NHS87BvVh4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 9, "2021": 33, "2022": 29, "2023": 15}}
