Batch and column studies were conducted to distinguish between the role of attachment and straining in microbe retention during transport. Batch experiments conducted at various solution chemistries showed negligible attachment of viruses and bacteria to biochar before or after chemical activation. At any given solution ionic strength, the attachment of viruses to sand was significantly higher than that of biochar, whereas bacteria showed no attachment to either sand or biochar. Consistent with batch results, biochar addition (10% w/w) to sand reduced virus retention in the column experiments, suggesting a potential negative impact of biochar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13052118995067657298", "cites_id": ["13052118995067657298"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971531281X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UtwiqxJxIrUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 21, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
