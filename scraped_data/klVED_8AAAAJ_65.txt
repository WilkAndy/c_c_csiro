Hydrolysis of all three compounds in both aqueous buffer and soil suspensions was highly pH\u2010sensitive. The rate of hydrolysis was much faster in the acidic pH range (5.2\u20136.2) than under neutral and moderately alkaline conditions (8.2\u20139.4), but it increased rapidly as the pH exceeded 10.2. All three compounds degraded faster at pH 5.2 than at pH 11.2. Hydrolysis rates of all three compounds could be described well with pseudo\u2010first\u2010order kinetics. There were no significant differences (P\u2005=\u20090.05) in the rate constants (k, day\u22121) of the three compounds in soil suspensions from those in buffer solutions within the pH ranges studied.
