The combination of chlorination with simulated or natural sunlight markedly enhanced removal of CBZ in 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) and river water (pH 7.0) compared with sunlight or FAC alone. Further analysis indicated that the observed enhancements in CBZ removal can be attributed to the in situ hydroxyl radical (HOradical dot) and ozone (O3) production during FAC photolysis. During 70 min simulated sunlight photolysis combined with FAC treatment, HOradical dot reaction contributed to 35.8% removal of CBZ and O3 reaction contributed to 40.6% removal, while only 5.3% of CBZ was removed by HOCl reaction.
