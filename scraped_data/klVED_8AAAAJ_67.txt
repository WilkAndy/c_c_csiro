Here, using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and elemental composition in a molecular mixing model, we estimated the molecular components of SOM in 24 soils from various agro\u2010ecological regions. Substantial variations were revealed in the molecular nature of SOM. As a proportion of soil carbon the proportion of the carbonyl component ranged from 0.006 to 0.05, charcoal from 0 to 0.15, protein from 0.09 to 0.29, aliphatic from 0.14 to 0.30, carbohydrate from 0.21 to 0.31, and lignin from 0.05 to 0.42. The relationships between Koc (sorption per unit mass of organic carbon) of carbaryl (1\u2010naphthyl methylcarbamate) and phosalone (S\u20106\u2010chloro\u20102,3\u2010dihydro\u20102\u2010oxobenzoxazol\u20103\u2010ylmethyl O,O \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1190585467507187949", "cites_id": ["1190585467507187949"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2005.00784.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7SCCuSzPhRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
