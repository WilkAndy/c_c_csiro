Commercial grade products were sprayed in dilute solution form at recommended rates to the surface of held plots. Irrigation was applied daily which together with rainfall gave effective rainfall equivalent to at least 120% of potential evaporation. Pesticide residue concentrations in soil samples taken at 5 cm increments down to 50 cm, at different days after application, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean leaching depths (MLDs) were calculated by weighting the percentage residues remaining at different depths in the soil profile. The MLDs for the 5 month period followed the order \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1819772135735241457", "cites_id": ["1819772135735241457"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr9951019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Sqnqh0hQRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 7, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 10, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
