Water samples were extracted using solid-phase extraction with C18 cartridges while solid samples (suspended particle matter and soil) were extracted by using the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) extraction method. The target pesticides were analyzed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron impact ionization. The proposed method allowed a simultaneous determination and confirmation of a large number of pesticides in agricultural drainage waters, suspended particle matters and soils/sediments with a good reproducibility and low detection limits. The developed method was applied to a survey of pesticides in a vegetable growing area of Guangzhou, China. The pesticides commonly found in the area \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11784995761412635314", "cites_id": ["11784995761412635314"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03601230903472165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:svp7ljS3jKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 11, "2014": 13, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
