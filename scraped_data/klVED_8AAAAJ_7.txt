The biochars prepared from the pyrolysis of Eucalyptus spp. wood chips at 450 and 850\u00b0C (BC850) were thoroughly mixed into the soil to achieve 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% by soil weight. A spring onion crop was grown for 5 wk in the biochar-amended soils spiked with 50mgkg\u22121 of each pesticide. The loss of both pesticides due to degradation and or sequestration in soils decreased significantly with increasing amounts of biochars in soil. Over 35 d, 86\u201388% of the pesticides were lost from the control soil, whereas it was only 51% of carbofuran and 44% of chlorpyrifos from the soil amended with 1.0% BC850. Despite greater persistence of the pesticide residues in biochar-amended soils, the plant uptake of pesticides decreased markedly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 505, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7809364839027708749", "cites_id": ["7809364839027708749"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653509004226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TROs__FvYGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 16, "2011": 23, "2012": 35, "2013": 39, "2014": 25, "2015": 48, "2016": 48, "2017": 51, "2018": 43, "2019": 39, "2020": 39, "2021": 39, "2022": 39, "2023": 15}}
