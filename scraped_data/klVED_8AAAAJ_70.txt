Within the temperate environment in Australia, the soils were selected from a range of land uses. The average KOC values (L/kg) for imidacloprid were 326, 322, and 336; for thiacloprid, the values were 915, 743, and 842; and for diuron, the values were 579, 536, and 618 for the Ord (tropical), Mt. Lofty (temperate), and Philippines (tropical) soils, respectively. For all soils, the sorption coefficients decreased in the following order:\u2009 thiacloprid > diuron > imidacloprid. There were no significant differences in sorption behavior between the tropical soils from the Philippines and the temperate soils from Australia. Sorption was also not significantly related with soil characteristics, namely, organic carbon (OC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3276238198237686382", "cites_id": ["3276238198237686382"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf050293l", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:buqFdUiJdy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 11, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
