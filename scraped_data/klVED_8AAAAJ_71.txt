The Freundlich sorption coefficient (Kf) values for fipronil on the soils ranged from 1.94 to 4.84 using a 5% acetonitrile/water mixture as the soil solution. Its two metabolites had a higher sorption affinity for soils, with Kf values ranging from 11.09 to 23.49 for the sulfide derivative and from 4.70 to 11.77 for the desulfynil derivative. Their sorption coefficients were found to be better related to the soil organic carbon than clay content.The presence of cosolvents in soil solutions had a significant influence on the sorption of fipronil. The Freundlich sorption coefficients showed a log linear relationship with the fractions of both acetonitrile and methanol in solutions.
