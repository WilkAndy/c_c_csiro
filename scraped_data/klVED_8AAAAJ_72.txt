Three metabolites of fipronil (desulfinyl, sulfide, and sulfone derivatives) were identified from soils after treatment. Laboratory studies showed that soil moisture content had a great effect on the degradation rate of fipronil and products formed. High soil moisture contents (>50%) favored the formation of a sulfide derivative of fipronil by reduction, whereas low soil moisture (<50%) and well-aerated conditions favored the formation of fipronil sulfone by oxidation. Microorganisms in soil accelerated the degradation of fipronil to sulfide and sulfone derivatives. The third transformation product, a desulfinyl derivative, was formed by photodecomposition of fipronil in water and on the soil surface under sunlight. The desulfinyl derivative degraded rapidly in field soils with a half-life of 41\u201355 days compared with an average half \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1626616604118850039", "cites_id": ["1626616604118850039"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr02018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:95lB6i7nkhYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
