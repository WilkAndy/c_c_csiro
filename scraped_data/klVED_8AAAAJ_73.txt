Biodegradation experiments were conducted in microcosms with 10% of activated sludge and digested sludge under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively. Benzophenone\u20103 was well degraded by microorganisms under each redox condition. Under the redox conditions studied, the biodegradation half\u2010life for BP\u20103 had the following order: oxic (10.7\u2009d)\u2009>\u2009nitrate\u2010reducing (8.7\u2009d)\u2009>\u2009Fe (III)\u2010reducing (5.1\u2009d)\u2009>\u2009sulfate\u2010reducing (4.3\u2009d) \u2265 anoxic unamended (4.2\u2009d). The results suggest that anaerobic biodegradation is a more favorable attenuation mechanism for BP\u20103. Biodegradation of BP\u20103 produced two products, 4\u2010cresol and 2,4\u2010dihydroxybenzophenone, under oxic and anoxic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6664778055919219701", "cites_id": ["6664778055919219701"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9TPikVQMflwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
