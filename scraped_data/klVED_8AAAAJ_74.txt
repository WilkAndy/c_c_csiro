X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectra, and a negative electrophoretic mobility strongly indicated that fenamiphos was intercalated within the bacterially inaccessible interlayer spaces of CTMA\u2212clay. The bacterium hydrolyzed, within 24 h, 82% of the fenamiphos sorbed by the CTMA\u2212clay complex. There was a concomitant accumulation of hydrolysis product, fenamiphos phenol, in nearly stoichiometric amounts. During the same period, in abiotic (uninoculated) controls, 4.6% of the sorbed insecticide was released into the aqueous phase as compared to 6.0% of the sorbed fenamiphos in another abiotic control where activated carbon, a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3378227241473706650", "cites_id": ["3378227241473706650"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf025978p", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:moqWCsff4S4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
