The sorption experiments were complemented by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to gain possible mechanistic insight into the organic acids\u2013mineral interactions. In terms of charge, the organic solutes ranged from strongly negative (i.e., citric) to positively charged solutes (i.e., lysine); similarly the mineral phases also ranged from positively to negatively charged surfaces. In general, sorption of anionic carboxylic and glutamic acids was higher compared to the other compounds (except lysine). Cationic lysine showed a stronger affinity to permanently charged phyllosilicates than Fe oxides. The sorption of alanine and phenylalanine was consistently low for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3022494116394428382", "cites_id": ["3022494116394428382"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002197971400455X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3udlj2IO8ikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 16, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
