Uniformly 13C-labeled benzene was sorbed to two charcoals produced in the laboratory at 450 and 850 \u00b0C. The chemical shift of benzene sorbed to the higher-temperature charcoal was 5\u22126 ppm lower than that of benzene sorbed to the lower-temperature charcoal. This difference was attributed to stronger diamagnetic ring currents (which cause a shift to lower ppm values) in the more condensed or \u201cgraphitic\u201d high-temperature charcoal. The chemical shift of benzene sorbed to two charcoals collected from the field following wildfires indicated a degree of charcoal graphitization intermediate between that of the two laboratory-prepared charcoals. Variable contact time and dipolar dephasing experiments showed that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15131909977089147159", "cites_id": ["15131909977089147159"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es051895o", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F4GWrfNX_9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
