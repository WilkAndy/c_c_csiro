It is shown that the photodegradation in water of benzotriazole, a common household and industrial chemical, is reduced in the presence of a sunscreen compound. Thus, contaminants such as benzotriazole may persist longer in the environment in the presence of chemicals designed to filter ultraviolet rays, such as those used in sunscreens. Abstract The presence of co-solutes (e.g. UV filters) can potentially influence the environmental fate of micropollutants. The photolysis of benzotriazole (BT, an anticorrosion agent) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3, a UV filter), as well as their interactions in aqueous solutions under UV and artificial solar light with or without added humic acid (HA) and metal ions (Cu2+ and Fe3+), has been investigated. BT was found to be photosensitive under UV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10879149584563424049", "cites_id": ["10879149584563424049"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN11068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mcs9LuiA-pYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 10, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
