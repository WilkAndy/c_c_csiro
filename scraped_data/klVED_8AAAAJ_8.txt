Landscapes throughout the tropics and subtropics are, however, dominated by Oxisols and Ultisols occupying extensive areas of potentially highly productive soils. The mineral fractions of these soils consist primarily of low\u2010activity clays having variable surface charge that differs from high activity clays in the origin of that charge. Low activity clays are dominated by iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) oxyhydroxides and 1:1 layer silicates (kaolin). Much research has been conducted on the effects of pH, organic matter (OM), and cation composition of the soil solution on the surface charge characteristics of variable charge soils from the tropics. In general, net negative surface charge increases with increasing soil pH and OM content.
