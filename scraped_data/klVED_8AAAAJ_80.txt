Two factors that may contribute to KOC variability are variations in organic matter chemistry between soils and interactions between organic matter and soil minerals. Here, we quantify these effects for two non-ionic sorbates\u2014diuron and phenanthrene. The effect of organic matter\u2013mineral interactions were evaluated by comparing KOC for demineralized (HF-treated) soils, with KOC for the corresponding whole soils. For diuron and phenanthrene, average ratios of KOC of the HF-treated soils to KOC of the whole soils were 2.5 and 2.3, respectively, indicating a substantial depression of KOC due to the presence of minerals in the whole soils.
