Previous studies have shown that non-target crustaceans, including commercially important species, can be extremely sensitive to these pesticides. Most shrimp farms in Australia are predominantly located adjacent to estuaries so they can obtain their required saline water, which support multiple land uses upstream (e.g. sugar-cane farming, banana farming, beef cattle and urbanisation). Larval and post-larval shrimp may be most susceptible to the impacts of these pesticides because of their high surface area to volume ratio and rapid growth requirements. However, given the uncertainties in the levels of insecticides in farm intake water and regarding the impacts of insecticide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9006018019286685242", "cites_id": ["9006018019286685242"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651317307819", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OpZZMKzN-3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 17, "2022": 18, "2023": 6}}
