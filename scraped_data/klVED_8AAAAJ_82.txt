It persists in soil and water environments for 3 to 6 months or more (Rao and Murty 1980; Kathpal et al. 1997; Awathi et al. 2000). However, it is generally less persistent in the environment than other cyclodienes. Endosulfan can undergo degradation to non-toxic or less toxic endosulfan diol or oxidation to equally or more toxic endosulfan sulfate in plants, microbial cultures and soils (Goebel et al. 1983). Formation of endosulfan sulfate is mediated essentially by microorganisms while hydrolysis of endosulfan to endosulfan diol can be chemical, especially under alkaline conditions, and/or microbial.
