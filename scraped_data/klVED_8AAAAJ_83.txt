Models based on both equilibrium and time-dependent sorption reactions were used to describe observed breakthrough curves (BTCs) of cadmium. Under batch conditions, the sorption of cadmium was essentially complete within 3 h for the Spodosol and within 24 h in the Oxisol. However, sorption in the Oxisol tended to increase at a very slow rate after 10 h up to 300 h. Simulations carried out using batch sorption data, which followed the Freundlich equation, failed to describe the observed cadmium BTCs satisfactorily. A sharp BTC front was expected due to the nonlinear nature of the sorption isotherm. However, a more dispersed front with significant asymmetry was observed in both soils, indicating the occurrence of non-equilibrium sorption during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3996963978061042608", "cites_id": ["3996963978061042608"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9940635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sFNcrI8ReDcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 7, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
