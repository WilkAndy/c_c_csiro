There is a shortage of data on these types on compounds in Australian biosolids, making it difficult to gain an understanding of their potential risks in the environment following land application. In this study, 14 biosolids samples were collected from 13 Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to determine concentrations of eight compounds that are PCPs and/or EDCs: 4-t-octylphenol (4tOP), 4-nonylphenol (4NP), triclosan (TCS), bisphenol A (BPA), estrone (E1), 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Concentration data were evaluated to determine if there were any differences between samples that had undergone anaerobic or aerobic treatment. The concentration data were also compared to other Australian and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1013210812831723971", "cites_id": ["1013210812831723971"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969710013161", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w3Frtd2lDw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
