Access to groundwater for farming communities is also an emotional and complex issue as their livelihood and survival depends on it. In this article, we report on transdisciplinary approaches to understanding the issues, challenges and options for improving sustainability of groundwater use in States of Gujarat and Rajasthan, India. In this project, called Managed Aquifer Recharge through Village level Intervention (MARVI), the research is focused on developing a suitable participatory approach and methodology with associated tools that will assist in improving supply and demand management of groundwater. The study was conducted in the Meghraj watershed in Aravalli district, Gujarat, and the Dharta watershed in Udaipur district, Rajasthan, India. The study involved the collection of hydrologic, agronomic and socio-economic data and engagement of local village and school communities through their role in groundwater monitoring, field trials, photovoice activities and education campaigns. The study revealed that availability of relevant and reliable data related to the various aspects of groundwater and developing trust and support between local communities, NGOs and government agencies are the key to moving towards a dialogue to decide on what to do to achieve sustainable use of groundwater. The analysis of long-term water table data indicated considerable fluctuation in groundwater levels from year to year or a net lowering of the water table, but the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13159727375452518201", "cites_id": ["13159727375452518201"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/84362", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ObfUIlO-oLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
