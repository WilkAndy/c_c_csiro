Following the application of biosolids to land, contaminants in the biosolids have the potential to migrate offsite via surface runoff and/or leaching and pose a hazard to aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this screening\u2010level assessment study was to determine the relative hazard posed to aquatic ecosystems by pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine\u2010disrupting compounds (EDCs) that have been detected and quantified in biosolids. This involved estimating maximum possible runoff water concentrations of compounds, using an equilibrium partitioning approach and then comparing these with the lowest available aquatic toxicity data, using the hazard quotient (HQ) approach. A total of 45 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and EDCs have been detected in biosolids. Ten of these compounds (tonalide, galaxolide, 17\u03b2\u2010estradiol, 17\u03b1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6791319844913390976", "cites_id": ["6791319844913390976"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ieam.74", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gKUfwGqdP14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
