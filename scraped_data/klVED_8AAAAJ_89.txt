This study used two biosolids treatments to examine the dissipation of four organic compounds: 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol, bisphenol A and triclosan, under field conditions in South Australia. The pattern of dissipation was assessed to determine if a first-order or a biphasic model better described the data. The field dissipation data was compared to previously obtained laboratory degradation data. The concentrations of 4-nonylphenol, 4-t-octylphenol and bisphenol A decreased during the field study, whereas the concentration of triclosan showed no marked decrease. The time taken for 50% of the initial concentration of the compounds in the two biosolids to dissipate (DT50), based on a first-order model, was 257 and 248d for 4-nonylphenol, 231 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18385456313242856422", "cites_id": ["18385456313242856422"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004565351101349X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5qtNSBtDJv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
