The sorption coefficients measured on the sediment were in the following order: 4-n-NP>4-t-OP>EE2>E2>BPA. The sorption coefficients (Kf values) for the five EDCs were 3.89, 21.8, 24.2, 90.9 and 195, respectively. The alkylphenols 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP had strong binding on the sediment while BPA had a weak affinity. Degradation experiments of the five EDCs showed that E2 and 4-n-NP degraded quickly under aerobic conditions with a half-life of 2 and 7 days, respectively. EE2 degraded slowly with an estimated half-life of 81 days in the aquifer material under aerobic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 447, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7284645164075800978", "cites_id": ["7284645164075800978"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135403002616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:klmBVy5CGGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 14, "2005": 22, "2006": 24, "2007": 30, "2008": 29, "2009": 40, "2010": 21, "2011": 20, "2012": 33, "2013": 30, "2014": 24, "2015": 21, "2016": 25, "2017": 21, "2018": 22, "2019": 21, "2020": 11, "2021": 18, "2022": 12, "2023": 7}}
