However, the uncertainty of production gains at realistic application rates of biochars and lack of knowledge about other benefits and other concerns may have resulted in poor uptake of biochar technology in Australia so far. In this review, we identify important opportunities as well as challenges in the adoption of biochar technology for broadacre farming and other sectors in Australia. The paper highlights that for biochar technology to be cost-effective and successful, we need to look beyond carbon sequestration and explore other opportunities to value-add to biochar. Therefore, some emerging and novel applications of biochar are identified. We also suggest some priority research areas that need immediate attention in order to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9413089053881382040", "cites_id": ["9413089053881382040"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR14112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mLS3L58CooIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
