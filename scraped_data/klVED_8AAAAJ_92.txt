Carbaryl is weakly sorbed and generally considered to be easily degradable in soil. Extraction studies revealed that 49% of the total carbaryl in soil (88.0 mg kg\u22121) was not water\u2010extractable and also not bioavailable, as demonstrated by inoculation of the contaminated soil with a carbaryl\u2010degrading, mixed bacterial culture. Inoculation of the contaminated soil with the carbaryl\u2010degrading culture showed that the bacteria were capable of degrading only the available (i.e., water\u2010extractable) fraction of the pesticide. When the soil was pulverized in a ball mill to enhance the release of residue, an additional 19% of the carbaryl became bioavailable. A significant proportion of residue (\u224833%) remained unavailable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=674212373284597544", "cites_id": ["674212373284597544"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/03-569", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KC_N1JRIWwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
