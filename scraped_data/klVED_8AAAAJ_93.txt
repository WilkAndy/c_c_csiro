However, KOC can vary by a factor of at least ten across a range of soils. We investigated two potential causes of variation in diuron KOC \u2013 organic matter\u2013mineral interactions and organic matter chemistry \u2013 for a diverse set of 34 soils from Sri Lanka, representing a wide range of soil types. Treatment with hydrofluoric acid (HF-treatment) was used to concentrate soil organic matter. HF-treatment increased KOC for the majority of soils (average factor 2.4). We attribute this increase to the blocking of organic matter sorption sites in the whole soils by minerals. There was no significant correlation between KOC for the whole soils and KOC for the HF-treated soils, indicating that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10123939882073580267", "cites_id": ["10123939882073580267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653514007127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6-JnDq91f4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
