Shrimp exposed to these pesticides exhibited significant AChE inhibition, with mortality in shrimp corresponding to 70\u201390% AChE inhibition. The sensitivity of P. australiensis to the four pesticides based on AChE inhibition can be given as chlorpyrifos>profenofos>carbaryl>dimethoate. Recovery of AChE activity was followed in shrimp after 96h exposures to carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. Recovery after exposure to the carbamate pesticide carbaryl was more rapid than for the two organophosphorus pesticides, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. The slow recovery of depressed AChE activity may mean that affected organisms in the natural system are unable to sustain physical activities such as searching for food or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16681600839094979880", "cites_id": ["16681600839094979880"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651310001661", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KE0di5TzgOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
