Their sorption is likely to influence their fate and, ultimately, the risk they pose to aquatic organisms. This has led to the European Medicines Agency requiring an assessment of affinity to solids, using batch sorption methods, for the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of new human medicines. However, a large body of data is generated before pharmaceuticals are released onto the market, including their extent of distribution throughout the human body, measured by the volume of distribution (VD). In the present study, batch sorption experiments were undertaken using 12 different soils and sediments to determine whether VD was a good indicator of experimental Kd values for 21 pharmaceuticals. The r2 values obtained from the regressions ranged from 0.39 to 0.76 (with a median value of 0.5) and all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14480676613938959247", "cites_id": ["14480676613938959247"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/08-587.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j1Mjkaiy9cgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
