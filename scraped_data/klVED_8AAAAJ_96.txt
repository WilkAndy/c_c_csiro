Due to incomplete removal in the wastewater treatment processes, pharmaceuticals present in treated wastewater and biosolids can contaminate soil systems. Benzodiazepines are a widely used class of pharmaceuticals that are released following wastewater treatment. Benzodiazepines are represented by a class of compounds with a range of physicochemical properties and this study was therefore designed to evaluate the influence of soil properties on the sorption behaviour and subsequent uptake of seven benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and triazolam) in two plant species. The sorption and desorption behaviour of benzodiazepines was strongly influenced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2196366588229944467", "cites_id": ["2196366588229944467"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971830384X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k4T7b8YPex4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 16, "2020": 8, "2021": 19, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
