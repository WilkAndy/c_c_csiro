For carbofuran, the Kd (L/kg) values varied from 0.11 to 4.1 (mean, 0.83; median, 0.62) and Koc ranged from 7.3 to 120.6 (mean, 41.65; median, 36.1), whereas for diuron Kd values varied from 0.5 to 75 (mean, 9.6; median, 5.15) and Koc ranged from 55.3 to 962 (mean, 407; median, 328). A comparison of sorption data on these tropical soils with published studies (mostly European and north American soils) showed that the ranges of sorption coefficients from Sri Lankan soils were within the wide range of Koc values reported in the literature. However, these values for both pesticides in soils from dry zones of Sri Lanka were consistently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "klVED_8AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8752023775663445035", "cites_id": ["8752023775663445035"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf052021o", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K1Qx9kBvdXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
