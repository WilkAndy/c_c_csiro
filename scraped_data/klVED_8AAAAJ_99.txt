This work presents the investigation of nine endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and 26 pharmaceutically active chemicals (PhACs) in marine sediments within the vicinities of 7 SSOs along the S\u00e3o Paulo State Coast (Brazil). Method optimization for the multi-residue determination by GC\u2013MS/MS and LC-MS/MS using QuEChERS extraction/clean-up are discussed. Results demonstrate the occurrence of EDCs in concentrations ranging from less than method quantification limits (MQL) to 72.5\u202fng\u202fg\u22121 in sediments. All PhACs were <MQLs. Nonylphenol was the most ubiquitous compound and the diversity of EDCs increased with an increase in populations serviced by SSOs.
