Numerous trophic-mediated and anthropogenic-related hypotheses, singly or in combination, have been proposed to explain COTS outbreaks, but the evidence remains inconclusive. There is, however, an urgent need for effective control and mitigation strategies. We develop a model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments to describe the trophic interactions between juvenile and adult COTS and 2 groups of coral (fast-and slow-growing corals). By fitting to available data, the impact of prey-switching behaviour by COTS and its effects on the system are quantified. Simulations are used to evaluate the effects of (1) predation by large fish on adult COTS,(2) predation by benthic invertebrates on juvenile COTS, and (3) manual removal of adult COTS.
