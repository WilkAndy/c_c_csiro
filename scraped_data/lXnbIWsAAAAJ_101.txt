To determine the extent of habitat change within Goat Island Bay, video transects positioned by a radio acoustic positioning telemetry (RAPT) system were used to map habitats within a Geographic Information System (GIS) framework. This map was compared to a map of the same area constructed 22 years earlier in 1978. Visual categorisation of habitats was consistent with the quantification of habitat-forming species within quadrats, justifying the creation of a map based on visually interpreted video footage. Furthermore, the large-scale changes in habitats were consistent with smaller-scale changes in community structure identified at permanent sites located in the study area. The most obvious changes were the total disappearance of \u2018urchin barrens\u2019 across all depths and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3050763128479063657", "cites_id": ["3050763128479063657"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF03190", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aZ7a1uZ8VioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
