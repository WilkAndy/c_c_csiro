Environmental managers aim to minimise human impacts during significant periods of larval production and recruitment on reefs, but doing so requires knowledge of the modes and timing of coral reproduction. Most corals are hermaphroditic or gonochoric, with a brooding or broadcast spawning mode of reproduction. Brooding corals are a significant component of some reefs and produce larvae over consecutive months. Broadcast spawning corals are more common and display considerable variation in their patterns of spawning among reefs. Highly synchronous spawning can occur on reefs around Australia, particularly on the Great Barrier Reef. On Australia\u2019s remote north-west coast there have been fewer studies of coral reproduction. The recent industrial expansion into these regions has facilitated research, but the associated data are often contained within confidential reports. Here we combine information in this grey-literature with that available publicly to update our knowledge of coral reproduction in WA, for tens of thousands of corals and hundreds of species from over a dozen reefs spanning 20\u00b0 of latitude. We identified broad patterns in coral reproduction, but more detailed insights were hindered by biased sampling; most studies focused on species of Acropora sampled over a few months at several reefs. Within the existing data, there was a latitudinal gradient in spawning activity among seasons, with mass spawning during autumn occurring on all reefs (but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5719893019656517409", "cites_id": ["5719893019656517409"], "pub_url": "https://peerj.com/articles/2010/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IffcZWUkYU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
