The independent effects of these drivers are well documented, but the relative importance and interaction between fishing and habitat shifts is poorly understood, particularly in complex systems such as coral reefs. To assess the combined and relative effects of fishing and habitat we examined the composition of fish communities on patch reefs across a gradient of high to low structural complexity in fished and unfished areas of the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Biomass and species richness of fish were positively correlated with structural complexity of reefs and negatively related to macroalgal cover. Total abundance of fish was also positively related to structural complexity, however this relationship was stronger on fished reefs than those where fishing is prohibited. The interaction between habitat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9953518021170932862", "cites_id": ["9953518021170932862"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113612001419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fqxXfef_IYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
