Subtropical environments, where many species overlap at their range margins, are cooler, more light\u2010limited and variable than tropical environments. It is thus likely that species respond variably to these multi\u2010stressor regimes and that factors other than mean climatic conditions drive biodiversity patterns. Here, we tested these hypotheses for scleractinian corals at their high\u2010latitude range limits in eastern Australia and investigated the role of mean climatic conditions and of parameters linked to abiotic stress in explaining the distribution and abundance of different groups of species. We found that environmental drivers varied among taxa and were predominantly linked to abiotic stress. The distribution and abundance of tropical species and gradients in species richness (alpha diversity) and turnover (beta diversity) were best \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=127061103254888294", "cites_id": ["127061103254888294"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.02986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zt9GdGZpwwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
