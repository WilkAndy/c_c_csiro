Total population sizes ranged from 25 to 292 colonies, and remained relatively constant. Population structures and dynamics based on both age and size were described. Differences between these two classifications were primarily due to tissue fission or shrinkage of colonies. In populations dominated by small size classes, young corals were not necessarily the most abundant. Similarly, populations dominated by the largest size classes were not always dominated by the oldest corals. In several populations, mean colony size decreased slightly with increasing age, though variability in size also increased. Mortality patterns were similar in all three species, with the youngest genets and smallest ramets suffering the highest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 406, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2030413835863010607", "cites_id": ["2030413835863010607"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2937107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ly2nSaB6LRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 6, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 7, "1996": 8, "1997": 7, "1998": 7, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 12, "2002": 7, "2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 14, "2006": 15, "2007": 15, "2008": 20, "2009": 16, "2010": 14, "2011": 20, "2012": 20, "2013": 10, "2014": 22, "2015": 19, "2016": 20, "2017": 18, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 17, "2021": 14, "2022": 18, "2023": 6}}
