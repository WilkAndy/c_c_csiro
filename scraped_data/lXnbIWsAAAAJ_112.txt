Many of these habitat types (e.g., urchin barrens, kelp forest) are frequently used in the literature but little attempt has been made to quantitatively define these habitats. A survey of shallow subtidal reefs in north\u2010eastern New Zealand identified a number of commonly occurring \u201chabitat types\u201d. In this paper the abundances of habitat\u2010forming species within each of these habitats are quantified and the validity of the subjective classification system is tested. In addition to previously\u2010described reef habitats from north\u2010eastern New Zealand a number of other habitat types were encountered and described in this study (e.g., \u201cmixed algae\u201d, \u201cred foliose algae\u201d, and \"Caulerpa mats\"). The algal communities within each habitat were biologically distinct and there was strong \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7828881507418231836", "cites_id": ["7828881507418231836"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.2004.9517273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HNRJdkDGpWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 8, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
