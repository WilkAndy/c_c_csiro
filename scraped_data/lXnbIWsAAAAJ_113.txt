The externally fertilized eggs of Protopalythoa sp. contain zooxanthellae and develop by radial cleavage to produce a hollow blastula. Gastrula formation takes place by a mechanism similar to invagination and proceeds by a flattening of the blastula followed by progressive concave/convex deformation.\u2014After two weeks the larvae have developed to the stage of zoanthella, and are able to settle after 17 to 19 days."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3300940479123879582", "cites_id": ["3300940479123879582"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924259.1990.9672115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nvbiauBLzy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
