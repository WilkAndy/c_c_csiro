Nearshore corals are receiving increased anthropogenic stress from coastal development and nutrient run-off. Considering forecast increases in global temperatures, greater understanding of drivers of recovery on nearshore coral reefs following widespread bleaching events is required to inform management of local stressors. The west Pilbara coral reefs, with cross-shelf turbidity gradients coupled with a large nearby dredging program and recent history of repeated coral bleaching due to heat stress, represent an opportune location to study recovery from multiple disturbances. Mean coral cover at west Pilbara reefs was monitored from 2009 to 2018 and declined from 45% in 2009 to 5% in 2014 following three heat waves \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=276210329070576550", "cites_id": ["276210329070576550"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479720305983", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pqOLs9RL1QMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 13, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
