We used a meta-analytical approach to assess coral cover data across latitudes 10\u201335\u00b0S along the west Australian coast, including 25 years of data from the Ningaloo region. Current estimates of coral cover ranged between 3 and 44% in coral habitats. Coral communities in the northern regions were dominated by corals from the families Acroporidae and Poritidae, which became less common at higher latitudes. At Ningaloo Reef coral cover has remained relatively stable through time (\u223c28%), although north-eastern and southern areas have experienced significant declines in overall cover. These declines are likely related to periodic disturbances such as cyclones and thermal anomalies, which were particularly noticeable around 1998/1999 and 2010/2011. Linear mixed effects models (LME) suggest latitude explains 10% of the deviance in coral cover through time at Ningaloo. Acroporidae has decreased in abundance relative to other common families at Ningaloo in the south, which might be related to persistence of more thermally and mechanically tolerant families. We identify regions where quantitative time-series data on coral cover and composition are lacking, particularly in north-western Australia. Standardising routine monitoring methods used by management and research agencies at these, and other locations, would allow a more robust assessment of coral condition and a better basis for conservation of coral reefs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1410202410611453410", "cites_id": ["1410202410611453410"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069863", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4i3l8Z4LkhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 12, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
