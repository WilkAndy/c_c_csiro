The Ningaloo Reef Marine Park comprises an area of 4,566 km2 of which 34% is protected from fishing by 18 no-take sanctuary zones ranging in size from 0.08\u201344.8 km2. To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5\u00b10.5 km2 compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km2. Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending \u223c80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km2 array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements. This study indicates that despite exhibiting stable and small home ranges over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18016807448220603613", "cites_id": ["18016807448220603613"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3RTNweqOCPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
