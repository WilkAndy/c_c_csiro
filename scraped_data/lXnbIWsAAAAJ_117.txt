The 10-year anniversary of the Integrated Marine Observing System\u2019s Animal Tracking Facility provided the opportunity to assess the efficiency of one of the first national-scale acoustic telemetry networks. Acoustic networks are comprised of acoustic receiver arrays that detect high-frequency transmitters attached to animals that pass within detection range. Herein we assessed the efficiency of eight curtains to detect passing animals by calculating the standardised mean number of detections and transmitters detected at each station. The aim was to determine how many receivers could be decommissioned from each curtain while maintaining its integrity (i.e. detection of all species passing the array). Pivotal locations were defined as the furthest station at which all species would still be detected and where at least 75% of the detections and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8291030157477817765", "cites_id": ["8291030157477817765"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf16126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pS2EHgCoD3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
