Debates continue, however, about whether we should avoid or promote the placement of reserves near potentially detrimental forces, including coastal cities or rivers. We performed a global meta\u2010analysis to test whether proximity to major coastal influences affected the ability of marine reserves to enhance the abundance of organisms relative to surrounding areas. A strong effect of reserve performance was evident for a range of trophic groups. Positive effects of reserves were undiminished by proximity to coastal cities or river discharges for the majority of taxonomic groups under conservation. We conclude that reserves placed in coastal areas are likely to protect marine populations to a similar extent as reserves in remote or less\u2010developed locations.
