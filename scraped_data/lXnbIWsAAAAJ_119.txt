A biomass-based dynamic model of Jurien Bay Marine Park (\u223c30\u00b0S) was constructed using Ecopath to investigate the ecosystem impacts of fishing (mainly commercial rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus) in the park, as an example of the potential responses of temperate marine ecosystems in Western Australia to commercial fishing. A simulated 50% reduction in fishing mortality for commercial finfish predicted that after 20 years, the biomass of important fished species (i.e. Pagrus auratus and Choerodon rubescens) would increase by up to 30%. A simulated total fishing closure resulted in much larger (2.5\u20138 fold \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2333496006529599895", "cites_id": ["2333496006529599895"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf09154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l0n9KUE-YiAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
