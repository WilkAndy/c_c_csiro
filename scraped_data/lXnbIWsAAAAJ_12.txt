Plasticity in the behavioural response of large reef fishes to SCUBA divers means that commonly used underwater visual census (UVC) techniques do not always provide reliable estimates of relative density. The paper describes the system configuration, deployment methods, testing and use of a remotely deployed baited underwater video (BUV) system for the survey of carnivorous reef fishes (snapper, Pagrus auratus and blue cod,Parapercis colias) in marine reserves of northern New Zealand. Concurrent UVC and BUV surveys inside and outside a marine reserve showed that, whereas UVC detected few snapper in either area (resulting in little confidence in statistically significant results), BUV demonstrated significant differences in relative density. Conversely, blue \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 383, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1139869167884227908", "cites_id": ["1139869167884227908"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf00010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RNUoCvig0Q8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 11, "2007": 11, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 16, "2011": 10, "2012": 25, "2013": 18, "2014": 21, "2015": 29, "2016": 33, "2017": 24, "2018": 23, "2019": 28, "2020": 31, "2021": 32, "2022": 19, "2023": 8}}
