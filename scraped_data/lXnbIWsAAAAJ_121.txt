In the present study, we tagged 34 Panulirus cygnus with acoustic transmitters on a shallow coastal reef in south-western Australia and monitored their movements using fixed and manual receivers between November and May 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007. We determined the proportion of \u2018white\u2019 (migratory-phase) lobsters emigrating from the reef between November and January and also characterised the large-scale movements of \u2018red\u2019 (residential-phase) and white lobsters. We undertook tank experiments to determine the effect of tagging and handling on P. cygnus behaviour. Counter to our expectation, 50% of white lobsters were detected on the reef after the migration period, whereas only a small proportion (13.6%) of white \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16017884451929181508", "cites_id": ["16017884451929181508"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF07239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RM196gr1St4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
