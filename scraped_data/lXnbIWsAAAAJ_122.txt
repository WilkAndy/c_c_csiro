In all three species the youngest genets suffered the highest rates of mortality with relatively low Mortality in older corals. Age-specific fecundity schedules showed a rapid increase in fecundity once reproductive age was reached at approximately 5 years. Fecundity decreased slightly in the older age classes due to the decrease in mean colony size. Estimated mean generation times ranged from 15 yrs for Goniastrea favulus to 24 yrs for Platygyra sinensis, however a small proportion of each population may live much longer. Despite the similarities among the species there are differences in a number of life history parameters. Trade-offs were apparent between reproductive, mortality and growth attributes, such as egg size, fecundity, age at first reproduction, survivorship and mean generation times."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13669488659607238081", "cites_id": ["13669488659607238081"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R-Babcock/publication/285707253_Age-structure_survivorship_and_fecundity_in_populations_of_massive_corals/links/5e3b759592851c7f7f1ff31b/Age-structure-survivorship-and-fecundity-in-populations-of-massive-corals.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wbUeCYPHs70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
