In the present study we examined movements of juvenile blacktip reef (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and sicklefin lemon (Negaprion acutidens) sharks in a coastal nursery in northern Australia. Telemetry-derived data were modelled using Brownian bridges and overlaid with maps of habitats and no-take zones. Juvenile N. acutidens were typically residents (\u226530 days) of the nursery with small areas of core space use (<1.9km2), whereas juvenile C. melanopterus were non-residents (<30 days) and used larger areas (<5.6km2). Both species exhibited positive selection for sandflats and mangroves, and avoidance of deeper lagoonal and slope habitats. Monthly patterns were examined only for resident N. acutidens, and residency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17861813685625493314", "cites_id": ["17861813685625493314"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf16131", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QhfrP-no4fcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
