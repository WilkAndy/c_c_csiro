Greater aggregation of individuals relieved Allee fertilisation dynamics, particularly at low densities, leading to higher rates of successful monospermic fertilisation and allowing populations to produce many more zygotes. This is likely more important to smaller, rather than larger, populations, due to limited and more variable reproductive success. In higher density populations a fertilisation optimum was observed at moderate levels of aggregation, above which monospermic fertilisation plateaued or even declined. This was likely due to 2 factors: the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15908903840802210468", "cites_id": ["15908903840802210468"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v578/p99-114/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pALdFMHHx9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 14, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
