Herein we present a brief review of the Australian acoustic telemetry literature in the context of key areas of progress, drawing from several recent studies and identifying areas for future progress. Acoustic telemetry has been increasingly used in Australia over the past decade. This has included substantial investment in a national acoustic array and the associated development of a national acoustic telemetry database that enables tag deployment and detection data to be shared among researchers (the Integrated Marine Observing System Animal Tracking Facility). Acoustic telemetry has contributed to important areas of management, including public safety, design and management of marine protected areas, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11908838555379087233", "cites_id": ["11908838555379087233"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf17054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gbfYBJKxRKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
