Effective conservation and management of large species like marine mammals or sea turtles depend on knowledge of movement and habitat use. Previous studies have used data collected from either satellite or acoustic telemetry but rarely both. In this study, data from satellite and acoustic technologies were used to: determine the efficacy of satellite and acoustic telemetry to define dugong movement patterns; compare the benefits and limitations of each approach; examine the costs of each approach in relation to the amount and type of data provided; and relate telemetry data to the boundaries of a Go Slow area designed to protect dugongs and turtles from vessel strike within an urbanised coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia). Twenty-one dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1428652526499985003", "cites_id": ["1428652526499985003"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098114003153", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a_Z-TeeX0xMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
