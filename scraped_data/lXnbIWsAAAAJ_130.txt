O. aahu burrowed into and hollowed out stipes with severe bleaching, accelerating mortality by 12\u201314 months. Meristoderm tissue of bleached plants contained approximately one-third of the phlorotannin content (~4% dry mass) present in unbleached, apparently healthier, sporophytes (~12% dry mass). Unbleached stages consistently lacked amphipod damage. O. aahu also colonised plants when non-lethal storm damage afforded entry into the cortical layers of the primary lamina, and ultimately the stipe. O. aahu typically consumed both medullary and cortical tissue of the stipes, forming networked brood-chambers within them, with increasing populations often reducing the plant to the holdfast. There was synchronised mortality \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4106011679933387289", "cites_id": ["4106011679933387289"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-003-1152-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GdIISt57-zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
