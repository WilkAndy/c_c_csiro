(Anthozoa, Zoanthidea) from Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef. Fertile zooids were gonochoric or hermaphroditic with oocytes and sperm vesicles intermingled in the same mesentery; colonies were single sex or mixed. Oocytes arose in macrocnemes below the actinopharynx and were first observed in July. Their mean diameter increased from < 50 \u00b5m to 160\u2013240 \u00b5m by November, by which time they contained zooxanthellae. Female zooids each produced 800\u20132400 ova. No testicular vesicles were visible before October but spermatozoa were present in November and December. Spawning in each of three years occurred in November (4th to 6th nights after full moon) simultaneously with mass spawning of scleractinian corals. The buoyant eggs (along with sperm in the hermaphroditic zooids) were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3388359377192973682", "cites_id": ["3388359377192973682"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00026451", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cnXzuObeBS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
