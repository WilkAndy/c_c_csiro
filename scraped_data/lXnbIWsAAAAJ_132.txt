On Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef (GBR), management interventions have evolved over four COTS outbreaks to include:(1) manual COTS control,(2) Marine Protected Area (MPA) zoning, and,(3) water quality improvement. Here we evaluate the contribution of these three approaches to managing population outbreaks of COTS to minimize coral loss. Strategic manual control at sites reduced COTS numbers, including larger, more fecund and damaging individuals. Sustained reduction in COTS densities and improvements in hard coral cover at a site were achieved through repeated control visits. MPAs influenced initial COTS densities but only marginally influenced final hard coral cover following COTS control. Water quality improvement programs have achieved only \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6552088384114890226", "cites_id": ["6552088384114890226"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-020-69466-1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8pUhwKux7VoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
