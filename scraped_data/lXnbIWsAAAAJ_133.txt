Twelve C. cautus were tagged with acoustic tags and monitored for up to 579\u2009days. Based on individuals detected within the receiver array for at least 2\u2009months, C. cautus had small core (50% kernel utilization distribution, KUD) and home ranges (95% KUD) of 0\u00b766 and 3\u00b764\u2009km2, respectively, and showed a strong habitat preference for mangroves, which are only found in the no\u2010take zone. This resulted in C. cautus spending most of their detected time within the no\u2010take zone boundaries (mean\u2009=\u200981\u00b75%), showing that such a protected area could be beneficial to protect this species from extensive fishing pressure and local depletion, where \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5432954950498403666", "cites_id": ["5432954950498403666"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfb.12724", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UkUoEb67ZUsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
