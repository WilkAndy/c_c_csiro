However, much of what we know of predator identity is based on a small number of detailed studies. This study aims to identify the key predator of early juvenile coral reef fishes on Ningaloo Reef, North-Western Australia. Video cameras were used to observe patch reefs stocked with newly settled reef fish in the back-reef area between 12:00 and 20:30 h. The cameras were fitted with >610 nm light sources to allow observation in low light conditions. All strikes (attempted and successful) on newly settled fish were recorded, along with the time spent in the vicinity of experimental patch reefs with or without juvenile fish. A total of 69 strikes were observed over the 199 h of recorded video footage, with the majority of strikes occurring mid-afternoon between 13:00 and 15:30 h. Only one strike was observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15462013501397022889", "cites_id": ["15462013501397022889"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-012-0934-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qTgQt1sblNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
