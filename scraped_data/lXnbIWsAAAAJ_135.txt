A visual grading system based on the macroscopic appearance of the gonad was developed and tested, and changes in visual grade, quantitative histology, and standardised gonad mass were used to describe seasonal and spatial patterns in gametogenesis and spawning. Visual grade was significantly correlated with histological and gonad mass data (r 2 = 0.74\u20130.87) and validated as an accurate method for measuring reproduction in P. novaezelandiae. Visual grading facilitates rapid assessment of reproductive condition and can be conducted non-destructively, thus providing a tool allowing long-term studies of individual spawning behavior in relation to environmental signals. Scallops exhibited episodic spawning, with spawning events detected in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6836181007343105126", "cites_id": ["6836181007343105126"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF03200", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZjT1Emj-3l4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
