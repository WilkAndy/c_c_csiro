The period of oogenesis lasted around 11 months, from late January to December, while spermatogenesis was more rapid, starting in late August and culminating in a spawning period in early December. Reproduction commenced at a polyp size of around 1,000 mm3 (5\u20136 years old) and the maximum estimated fecundity of the largest corals (7,000 mm3) was no more than 200 eggs. Oocytes were probably fertilized while within the mesentery and were shed into the coelenteron where they developed, via a solid blastula stage, for approximately 1 month. Planulae were relatively large, 3\u20134 mm in length and 1\u20132 mm diameter at the time of release, and crawled or swam immediately to the substratum. Peaks of planula shedding were semi-lunar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10174106619346626627", "cites_id": ["10174106619346626627"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-001-0745-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QygbyRCwMY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
