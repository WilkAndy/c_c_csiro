As transmitters on animals or people telemeter information via RAPT, it records their position with an accuracy of as little as one meter in as much as a cubic kilometer of water from a range of up to ten kilometres\u2014scales appropriate to many marine protected areas (MPAs). RAPT studies in Lizard Island, Australia; Exuma Cay Park, Bahamas; Moriye Bay, Japan, and Leigh Laboratory Reserve, New Zealand, four significant MPAs, are reviewed showing the power of the technology for understanding and managing many aspects of a range of biological reserve types. Most studies to date have focused on monitoring fish (Lutjanus carponotatus, Lutjanidae; Plectropomus leopardus, Serranidae \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9328510772994452901", "cites_id": ["9328510772994452901"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-1402-0_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pS29mx-HdYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
