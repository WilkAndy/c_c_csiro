However, the persistence and mechanisms underlying the arrangement of these patterns are not well understood. We described patterns in the proportion of reef covered by each of these habitats, and the length of patches of each habitat, at 20 sites encompassing a gradient in wave exposure in south-western Australia. Our aims were to characterise patterns in habitat distribution, and the strength of associations with potential influences, in order to develop models of habitat mosaic generation and maintenance. Modelled seabed orbital velocities explained approximately 35% of the variation in the length of open-gap patches, with longer patch lengths at sites that experienced highest water velocities. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that waves create \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9415465215556225317", "cites_id": ["9415465215556225317"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771411004252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JYlGcLpzqoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
