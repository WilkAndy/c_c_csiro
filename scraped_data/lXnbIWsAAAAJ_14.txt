Experiments were conducted using larvae of Platygyra sinensis (Edwards and Haime), a shallow water species with a massive morphology, and Oxypora lacera (Verrill), a shade-loving or deep water species with a laminar morphology. Settlement orientations in experimental field enclosures varied according to depth, Oxypora choosing more cryptic microhabitats than Platygyra. Laboratory settlement experiments utilising different light intensities indicated that light level was the variable responsible for changes in settlement orientation with depth. Total numbers of larvae settled at a range of depths did not correspond with adult distribution for either species, though there were significant variations in settlement with depth.
