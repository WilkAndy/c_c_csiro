The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An Australia\u2010wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100 m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta\u2010analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28% greater abundance and 53% greater biomass of fished species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2370772091081990806", "cites_id": ["2370772091081990806"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:liJa7Kes5iAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
