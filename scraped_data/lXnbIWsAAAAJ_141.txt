We used acoustic telemetry to determine the distances from high-relief reef where nocturnally active P. cygnus forage at 3 sites representing 3 common shallow-water habitats: meadows of the seagrasses Amphibolis spp. and Posidonia sinuosa and macroalga-dominated pavement. We focussed on among-site variation in core and total nocturnal activity area, distance of foraging from high-relief reef and total distance between position estimates. We found that P. cygnus moved over an extensive area at all sites and that 90% of lobster activity occurred within 60 m of the nearest high-relief reef at all 3 sites regardless of habitat type. Foraging activity by P. cygnus is therefore likely to be greatest within this zone around coastal reefs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15545038080928616165", "cites_id": ["15545038080928616165"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/ab/v4/n2/p201-210/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Y6rAcYRu9cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 4}}
