The reserve and two reference locations (Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands) were sampled biannually over 3\u00bd years using two survey methods: baited underwater video (BUV), and underwater visual census (UVC). Following the implementation of full marine reserve status at the Poor Knights Islands in 1998, both methods found that snapper (Pagrus auratus) dramatically increased in abundance (relative to fished reference locations): mean (\u00b1SE) snapper size also increased here from 274 (\u00b19) mm in autumn 1999 to 324 (\u00b15) mm in spring 2001 (BUV). BUV also found porae (Nemadactylus douglasii) increased in density at the Poor Knights Is and UVC found blue maomao (Scorpis violaceus), pink maomao (Caprodon longimanus) and orange wrasse (Pseudolabrus luculentus) increased in density. Seven species decreased significantly in density in the reserve but only three at both reference locations. The drop in density of some species may result from competitive or predatory interactions with snapper or other species. Several seasonal trends were apparent. There was evidence that the earlier partial fishing regulations were inefficient at protecting targeted species. The increase in snapper density in particular, since full reserve status, has been rapid, probably resulting from immigrating adult fish rather than from recruitment. It is not yet clear whether snapper numbers have stabilised. Populations sustained by larval recruitment (eg pink maomao) may take longer to recover."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6905815270252993987", "cites_id": ["6905815270252993987"], "pub_url": "https://www.doc.govt.nz/globalassets/documents/science-and-technical/DSIS142.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w93lU2Zi1l8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
