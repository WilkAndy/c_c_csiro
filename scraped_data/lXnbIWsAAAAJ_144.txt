Here, we used a phylogenetic community ecology approach to examine how ecological and evolutionary processes shape biodiversity patterns of scleractinian corals at their high-latitude range limits in eastern Australia. We estimated phylogenetic signal in seven ecologically important functional traits and conducted tests of phylogenetic structure at local and regional scales using the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon indices (NTI) for the presence/absence and abundance data. Regional tests showed light phylogenetic clustering, indicating that coral species found in this subtropical-to-temperate transition zone are more closely related to each other than are species on the nearby, more northerly Great Barrier Reef. Local tests revealed variable patterns of phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2868308413350233097", "cites_id": ["2868308413350233097"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2017.0915", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CUQBFE5HzicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
