Combined with shipboard systems, scientists are able to make in-situ measurements of water column and benthic properties. In CSIRO, autonomous gliders are used to collect water column data, while surface vessels are used to collect bathymetry information through the use of swath mapping, bottom grabs, and towed video systems. Although these methods have provided good data coverage for coastal and deep waters beyond 50m, there has been an increasing need for autonomous in-situ sampling in waters less than 50m deep. In addition, the collection of benthic and water column data has been conducted separately, requiring extensive post-processing to combine data streams. As such, a new AUV was developed for in-situ observations of both benthic habitat and water column properties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1998619245094763430", "cites_id": ["1998619245094763430"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7271362/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pvshQZ2FvBsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
