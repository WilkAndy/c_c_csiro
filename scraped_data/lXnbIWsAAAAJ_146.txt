The workshop brought together 26 experts actively involved in the science and management of subtropical reefs. Its primary aim was to identify the areas of research that need to be most urgently addressed to improve the decision\u2010making framework for managers of subtropical reefs. The main findings of the workshop were a sustainable subtropical reefs declaration that highlights seven research priorities for subtropical reefs. These are to (i) conduct research and management activities across local government, state and bioregion borders; (ii) understand natural variability of environmental conditions; (iii) quantify socio\u2010economic factors and ecosystem services; (iv) benchmark cross\u2010realm connectivity; (v) know marine population \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13562083706458749063", "cites_id": ["13562083706458749063"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-8903.2011.00573.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hziWqUYzNrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
