Although such compounds are usually terpenederived and typically reported from sponges, 1-4 an ascidian-derived alkaloid enantiomeric pair, segolines B and C, have been recently reported. 5 As part of our ongoing search for new bioactive compounds from New Zealand ascidians, 6 we have found extracts of the delicate pink stalked ascidian, Hypsistozoa fasmeriana (Michaelsen, 1924)(order Aplousobranchia, family Holozoidae) 7 to exhibit a wide range of biological activities. Bioassay-directed fractionation of extracts of specimens collected at Tutukaka, North Island, New Zealand, afforded the new (-) enantiomer of trans-5-hydroxy-4-(4\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2\u2032\u2032-imidazolyl)-1, 2, 3-trithiane (1). 8 A second collection of H. fasmeriana made at Leigh Harbor, Northland, afforded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1184047609109656418", "cites_id": ["1184047609109656418"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo010769+", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YrMh8gaVbhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
