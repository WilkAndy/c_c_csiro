We used meta-analysis to synthesise 4444 samples from 30\u202fyears (1987\u20132017) of fish surveys inside and outside a large network of highly protected reserves in the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia, where the major fishing activity is recreational. Data were collected by different agencies, using varied survey designs and sampling methods. We contrasted the relative abundance and biomass of target and non-target fish groups between fished and reserve locations. We considered the influence of, and possible interactions between, seven additional variables: age and size of reserve, one of two reserve network configurations, reef habitat type, recreational fishing activity, shore-based fishing regulations and survey method. Taxa responded differently: the abundance and biomass inside reserves relative to outside was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5754185415028394291", "cites_id": ["5754185415028394291"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718317464", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M0mA4iX52k8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
