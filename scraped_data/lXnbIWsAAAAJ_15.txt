Gametes remained viable for 2 h after spawning, but one species exhibited signs of reduced fertility 3-4 h after spawning. Sperm dilution trials carried out in the laboratory indicated that fertilization reaches a maximum at sperm concentrations of 105-106 per ml, with reduced fertilization occurring at both higher and lower concentrations. Estimates of \"fertilization potential\" in the field were obtained by exposing eggs to water samples taken from the field at various times and locations following episodes of coral spawning. This sampling program indicated that on nights when only small numbers of coral spawned (minor spawning), the fertilization potential was much lower than on major spawning nights. On major spawning nights, fertilization potential was consistently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 335, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6470524848883992946", "cites_id": ["6470524848883992946"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/1542017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cokRWBHsy1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 7, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 10, "1998": 8, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 14, "2002": 12, "2003": 9, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 12, "2008": 7, "2009": 12, "2010": 5, "2011": 16, "2012": 9, "2013": 18, "2014": 12, "2015": 20, "2016": 20, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 18, "2020": 14, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 9}}
