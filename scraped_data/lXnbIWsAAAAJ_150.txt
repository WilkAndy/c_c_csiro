In particular, acroporid and pocilloporid populations were dramatically reduced, while poritid and faviid corals were less impacted and now dominate coral assemblages. Subsequent to this perturbation, there have been changes in the abundance and distribution of the coral eating crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster cf. solaris (to densities of up to 320 ha\u22121) that have had a further impact on coral communities selectively targeting the coral taxa most susceptible to bleaching, often referred to as climate change \u201closers\u201d. The feeding selectivity of A. cf. solaris under post-bleaching conditions was studied to determine its likely impact on coral communities and coral recovery. We found that even when Acropora and Pocillopora were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18439597398073175498", "cites_id": ["18439597398073175498"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-019-3515-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ym1e6SKc5v8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
