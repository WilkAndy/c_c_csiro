This starfish has been observed spawning in the field from December to January on the GBR, with most observations being made in January. In contrast both gonad index and fertility peak early in the season, declining to low levels by late January. These observations indicate that the majority of successful reproductive events will take place early in the spawning season, before the onset of the monsoonal wet season. The timing of spawning may need to be considered in evaluating the importance of terrestrial runoff as a pos-sible causal factor in outbreaks on the GBR."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1764825836941058883", "cites_id": ["1764825836941058883"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1764825836941058883&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q6NNjb_rfRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
