Whilst CoTS have previously been recorded at Barrow and the Montebello Islands, in the Pilbara offshore bioregion of northwestern Australia, their densities were relatively low. Outbreak densities of CoTS have been described as the level at which the rate of coral consumption by the starfish is equal to or greater than rate at which the coral grows. In 2014, we recorded densities as high as 320\u2009\u00b1\u200958 CoTS ha\u22121 in the region which is well above recognised outbreak densities. Whilst there is little terrestrial runoff and agriculture in the Pilbara region, both temperature and chlorophyll-\u03b1 levels appear to be sufficient to allow a high degree of CoTS larval success in most years. The region was subjected to anomalously high water temperatures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12547023677993478120", "cites_id": ["12547023677993478120"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-019-3543-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6Gc34477H64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
