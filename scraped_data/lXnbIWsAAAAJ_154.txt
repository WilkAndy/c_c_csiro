However, in recent years climate change has emerged as the primary threat to coral reefs. While reefs have a natural capacity for recovery, recurring events like mass coral bleaching and extreme weather events is increasing in frequency, intensity and severity, and are eroding the time for recovery between catastrophic events.  Marine conservation has primarily focused on passive habitat protection over active restoration, in contrast to terrestrial ecosystems where active restoration is common practice. Further, active restoration is well accepted for wetlands and shellfish reefs however coral reef restoration has remained controversial both in academia and amongst marine managers. This is despite recent research suggesting that optimal conservation outcomes include both habitat protection and restoration. Critics often argue that coral restoration detracts focus from mitigating climate change and other threats to the marine environment, while proponents of coral restoration counter that interventions can serve to protect coral biodiversity and endangered species in the short-term, while mitigation of large-scale threats such as climate change and water quality take effect. Despite this disconnect between coral restoration practitioners \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7381178603972746849", "cites_id": ["7381178603972746849"], "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/59790/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YV6CSdU2b2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
