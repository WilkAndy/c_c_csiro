Indeed, it is estimated that successful CoTS management could turn the GBR\u2019s current long-term decline in coral cover around. As a consequence, CoTS control and the mitigation of their impacts is emerging as a priority for management and for research.There is a long history of research into CoTS biology, ecology, and the causes of their outbreaks. Although by no means complete, this legacy provides a solid foundation for future work. In contrast, there has been only slow improvement in CoTS control programs. Other than the development of the single-injection method for culling and the deployment of a dedicated control program, there has been no significant advance in how control activities are implemented or in their effectiveness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17702454397001847822", "cites_id": ["17702454397001847822"], "pub_url": "https://nesptropical.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NESP-TWQ-1.1-FINAL-REPORT.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DtTYgXvAq_UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 10, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
