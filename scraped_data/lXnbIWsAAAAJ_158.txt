The composition of benthic communities of the Ningaloo Marine Park in deeper water (>\u200920 m) was determined using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Environmental variables collected by the AUVs as well as geomorphological variables derived from high-resolution multibeam bathymetry were used to explain the distribution of these communities. Imagery was classified for benthic biota, and non-hierarchical k-means clustering was used to identify community groups. Overall, 12 community groups were identified which fell into three broad categories: (1) coral-dominated, (2) CCA-dominated; and (3) macroalgae- and filter-feeder-dominated. Specific deeper water communities (>\u200950 m) were characterised by the presence of sponges or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13971763151374288282", "cites_id": ["13971763151374288282"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-018-1700-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:moWOg4-s5cEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
