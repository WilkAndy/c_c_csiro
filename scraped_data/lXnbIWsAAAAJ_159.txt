For mobile species such as fish, knowledge of the scale and variation in movement is central to key planning decisions, such as the size and shape of marine reserves and the interpretation of the response of protected populations. For example, populations of species that require large areas of habitat may not show increases in abundance inside small reserves, but calculating optimal reserve size is complicated by individual variations in behaviour. Fish movements can be used to quantitatively inform marine reserve planning and assessment. An individual based numerical simulation model including acoustic telemetry and census data was used to simulate changes in populations of snapper Pagrus auratus in north-eastern New Zealand. Four behavioural categories and offshore migration were used to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4423070586226360562", "cites_id": ["4423070586226360562"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/incorporating-behavioural-variation-in-individualbased-simulation-models-of-marine-reserve-effectiveness/FBF505D9FDF4AC49C25882D6F5095F5D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8kCAhEPnYT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
