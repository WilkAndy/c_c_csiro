Settlement of the submassive Goniastrea retiformis and corymbose Acropora digitifera and A. millepora was quantified at densities ranging from 1 to 50 larvae per 20 mL from 110 to 216 h following spawning. Settlement patterns were distinct for each species. Goniastrea settlement was rapid and increased linearly with time, whereas both Acropora spp. hardly settled until crustose coralline algae was provided. Both Goniastrea and A. digitifera showed positive density-dependent settlement, but the relationship was exponential for Goniastrea but linear for A. digitifera. Settlement was highest but density independent in A. millepora. Our results suggest that larval density can have significant effects on settler replenishment, and highlight variability in density \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14332385774772522765", "cites_id": ["14332385774772522765"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-017-1629-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DY8tCe3c5sYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
