Despite this important ecological role, we have a poor understanding of the movement patterns of such large herbivorous fish, including Kyphosus bigibbus. Nineteen K. bigibbus captured near adjacent but distinct patch reefs were tagged with internal acoustic tags and their movements monitored for up to 20 months by an array of 60 acoustic receivers. Home-range estimates showed that movements of individuals from each patch reef encompassed different spatial extents and resulted in differences in habitat used by the two groups of fish. The average 50 and 95% kernel utilisation distribution for long-term resident fish was 0.27\u00b10.03 and 1.61\u00b10.30km2 respectively, ranges that represent the largest values for a herbivorous coral reef fish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15352926720345848922", "cites_id": ["15352926720345848922"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf16199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WjzRRIKNENUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
