We argue that our improved understanding of COTS ecology and ability to monitor their populations, combined with new efficiencies in COTS control technologies, provides a sound basis for attempting to suppress COTS outbreaks on the GBR before they reach full outbreak status. This conclusion is based on research on the GBR which we have synthesised to develop a new, pragmatic approach to managing primary outbreaks. We also outline key actions that must be undertaken in order for suppression to be successful, providing clear direction for future management action. The next COTS outbreak on the GBR is predicted to begin between 2025 and 2027, consequently efforts to detect and suppress pre-initiation populations must start no later than the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8333565788760388856", "cites_id": ["8333565788760388856"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-020-01978-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-DRph-7FpnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
