Herbivorous fish from major families in this functional group were also censused. A further aim of the work was to provide baseline data on populations from newly declared sanctuary zones that could be used to assess future trends in protected populations as well as across the park as a whole. Over 900 sites were surveyed over this time using underwater visual census (UVC), with effort focused on 12 sanctuary zones distributed along the length of the park.Fish assemblage structure showed clear trends with habitat and from north to south. There was also a significant overall difference in fish assemblages inside and outside sanctuary zones. The zoning related patterns appeared to be complex however, and examination of assemblages on a region by region basis showed zoning-related patterns in assemblages at only three sites, where targeted species were among those most likely to explain observed differences in assemblages. Non-target groups, including large grazers (scarids and kyphosids) were also associated with these differences. Among the species most commonly targeted by anglers there was an overall increase in biomass for the yellow tailed emperor (L. atkinsoni) which was between 0.9 and 2.4 times greater in pre-existing sanctuary zones, as well as in the spangled emperor (L. nebulosus) with biomass between 0.4 and 2.8 times greater. These trends in fish biomass were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1706351223430073911", "cites_id": ["1706351223430073911"], "pub_url": "https://ningaloo-atlas.org.au/sites/default/files/WAMSI%203.2.2a%20final%20report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N06apmUtrhcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
