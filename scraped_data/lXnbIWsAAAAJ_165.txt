However, in areas where marine reserves have been established for some time, valuable information is now becoming available. New Zealand's no-take marine reserves have demonstrated large increases in abundance and size of exploited species such as Snapper Pagrus auratus, Spiny Lobster Jasus edwardsii and Blue Cod Parapercis colias in marine reserves. Significant increases have been rapid, occurring within one year in the case of snapper, but only evident where full no-take protection is afforded. These increases in biomass of exploited species translate into levels of egg production between 4.4 and 18 times those of surrounding areas of coastline. There is no evidence of increased egg production translating into increased recruitment to fished populations, but such effects would be impossible \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15643664775856974367", "cites_id": ["15643664775856974367"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/rzsnsw-other-books/book/603/chapter/12050078/The-New-Zealand-Marine-Reserve-Experience-the", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H-o-3jp2GdkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2}}
