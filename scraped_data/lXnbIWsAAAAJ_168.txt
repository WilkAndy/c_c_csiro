Fish migration and associated movements are key mechanisms through which discrete populations mix and are thus important determinants of population structure. Detailed information on fish migration and movements is becoming more accessible through advances in telemetry and analysis methods however such information is not yet used systematically in stock structure assessment. Here, we described how detections of acoustically tagged fish across a continental\u2010scale array of underwater acoustic receivers were used to assess stock structure and connectivity in seven teleost and seven shark species and compared to findings from genetic and conventional tagging. Network analysis revealed previously unknown population connections in some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5284080567906368395", "cites_id": ["5284080567906368395"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12565", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i3uavkfTVEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
