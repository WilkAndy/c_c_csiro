Resource management of such environments is best achieved by combining in situ sampling of biooptical and biogeochemical parameters, which are spatially and temporally limited, with satellite retrieved estimates of the same parameters, which are spatially broader and temporally more frequent. However, while remotely sensed satellite data provides a large data set, it has been demonstrated that standard global algorithms are inaccurate in near-shore coastal waters (Schroeder et al. 2012).Light availability is one of the basic requirements for the development and sustainability of phytoplankton within the water column as well as plants on the seabed, and is determined by the optical properties of the dissolved and particulate components within the water column. High levels of particulate and dissolved organic matter in the water column scatter and absorb light which affects both benthic and pelagic photosynthesis and hence primary production. The absorption and scattering properties of the water column will also determine what percentage of incident irradiance is reflected back from the water column to a satellite sensor. Often the absorption and scattering properties of coastal waters can be dominated by high sediment loadings or by high concentrations of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) that will affect the accuracy of satellite-retrieval of chlorophyll-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass. The in situ samples can provide data for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4178351988345575265", "cites_id": ["4178351988345575265"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kadija-Oubelkheir/publication/343549209_An_integrated_study_of_the_Gladstone_marine_system/links/5f33952692851cd302ef3e4f/An-integrated-study-of-the-Gladstone-marine-system.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YZfi2_58_DkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
