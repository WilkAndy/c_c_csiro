In order to understand the direct and indirect impacts of these increased population sizes on coastal food chains, the effect of areas with more fish predators on the survival and behaviour of potential prey was assessed. Juvenile lobsters, Jasus edwardsii (10\u201320 mm carapace length), were tethered on rocky reefs inside and outside marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand to assess survival under differing predator densities. Since rocky reef habitats in northeastern New Zealand include zones of kelp forest and barren reef, a two-way factorial design was used to determine the effects of predators, habitat, and the interaction of these two factors on juvenile lobster survival. Overall, the results indicated that neither varying large fish density nor varying kelp density had direct impacts on the survival rate of juvenile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6054243093313875051", "cites_id": ["6054243093313875051"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF07116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a-zVQAT-BFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
