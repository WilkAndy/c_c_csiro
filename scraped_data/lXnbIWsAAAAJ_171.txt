At recently colonised sites, C. flexuosum occurs mainly on coralline\u2010dominated areas with moderate densities of sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus). At these sites, stipes of C. flexuosum are shorter, with more branching, reduced laminae, and increased stipe weights compared to those at sheltered sites. Survivorship of tagged individuals was less on wave\u2010exposed than on sheltered reefs. On sheltered shores, small C. flexuosum suffered moderate mortality, but large individuals suffered little mortality from any source. All individuals transplanted from sheltered to wave\u2010exposed shores died or became moribund as stipes, whereas those which survived transplanting from wave\u2010exposed to sheltered shores assumed a morphology more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3652819251361791116", "cites_id": ["3652819251361791116"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.2001.9516976", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jLwgcsFrsTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
