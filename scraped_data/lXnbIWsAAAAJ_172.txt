Water depth has been suggested as being one such factor affecting fertilization success. In experimental spawnings of the sea star Coscinasterias muricata, fertilization rates decreased exponentially with distance from sperm source but were frequently greater than 20% at distances >10 m downstream. Current speed did not have a significant effect on fertilization rate over the range of velocities examined. Fertilization rates directly downstream from spawning individuals were higher in shallow water (<1 m) than in deep water (>5 m). Diffusion models using empirically derived site-dependent diffusion parameters supported these findings but suggested that this would only be true for eggs released directly downstream from a sperm source.
