To investigate the outbreak densities of the corallivorous gastropod Drupella cornus, we conducted both in situ feeding and coral growth experiments at Mandu reef within the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Over two 10-day periods, we tagged and photographed feeding scars on colonies of the tabulate coral Acropora spicifera that harboured Drupella feeding aggregations. We calculated a mean in situ Drupella consumption rate of 1.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 cm2 coral area individual\u22121 d\u22121. We also determined coral growth rates by tagging and photographing 24 colonies of Acropora spicifera at time zero and then again 1 year later. We calculated a mean linear extension rate of 7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9191098043743099346", "cites_id": ["9191098043743099346"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-018-01748-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0lkYaflWjX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
