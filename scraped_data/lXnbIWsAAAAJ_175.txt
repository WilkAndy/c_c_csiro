However, estimating the abundance of sparsely distributed species is challenging, especially where direct observations are difficult. We collected observations of blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus by using remote underwater video cameras, and developed an agent-based model to generate estimates of the density of sharks from the frequency of observations made using the video. We augmented these observations with diel patterns in detections in different habitats of C. melanopterus with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters. Median estimates of density ranged from 2-9 ind. km-2 at noon to 20-90 ind. km-2 at dusk, depending on whether modelled movement paths were random or directional. These estimates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7086317793088126834", "cites_id": ["7086317793088126834"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v508/p201-209/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cj-M5nyoV2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
