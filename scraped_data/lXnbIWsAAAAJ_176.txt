The foresight of the founders of the laboratory has enabled the pursuit of ecological studies that have been amongst the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of reserves as a tool for conservation and restoration. The insights flowing from this work at Leigh are important, not only for targeted marine species, but also at the ecosystem level, and have proven to be highly relevant to broader resource management issues. Novel methodologies have been employed in the pursuit of these aims, helping to popularise their wider use. More recent work has focused on understanding the processes underlying the variability in response to marine conservation in marine reserves across the spectrum of coastal marine habitats in New Zealand. The LML has probably exceeded the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7802810617651656973", "cites_id": ["7802810617651656973"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.2013.810160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DfnFauomSWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
