In addition, the potential effect of environmental variables in explaining differences between reserve and non-reserve sites was investigated. At Leigh and Tawharanui, which had been protected for 24 and 17 years, respectively, results supported previous work, with the extent of urchin barrens habitat and the overall density of E. chloroticus being significantly lower in these reserves than on the adjacent coasts. Algal communities were more than twice as productive at reserve sites in the 4 6 m depth stratum at Leigh and Tawharanui, but no differences were found at other depths. In addition, differences in herbivorous gastropods (Cellana stellifera and Cookia sulcata) were found between reserve and non-reserve sites. These differences may be a direct effect of higher predation in the reserve but also an indirect effect associated with decreased sea urchin abundance and changes in algal assemblages. These patterns, however, were not consistent for the other marine reserves examined, which generally had been protected for shorter periods. Instead, algal communities were strongly related to a number of environmental variables, and the importance of E. chloroticus changed across environmental gradients, both within and among locations. As a result, there were no universal differences among locations between reserve and non-reserve \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3326649141113083330", "cites_id": ["3326649141113083330"], "pub_url": "https://dcon01mstr0c21wprod.azurewebsites.net/globalassets/documents/science-and-technical/dsis192.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wlVnvMShKi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
