However, there are still important knowledge gaps pertaining to the biology, ecology, and management of Acanthaster sp. Renewed efforts to advance understanding and management of Pacific crown-of-thorns sea stars (Acanthaster sp.) on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef require explicit consideration of relevant and tractable knowledge gaps. Drawing on established horizon scanning methodologies, this study identified contemporary knowledge gaps by asking active and/or established crown-of-thorns sea star researchers to pose critical research questions that they believe should be addressed to improve the understanding and management of crown-of-thorns sea \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9404127220350978428", "cites_id": ["9404127220350978428"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/717026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fAmat-ErgoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
