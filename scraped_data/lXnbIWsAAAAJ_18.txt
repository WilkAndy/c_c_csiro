While marine conservation has historically focused on passive habitat protection, demand for and interest in active restoration has been growing in recent decades. However, a disconnect between coral restoration practitioners, coral reef managers and scientists has resulted in a disjointed field where it is difficult to gain an overview of existing knowledge. To address this, we aimed to synthesise the available knowledge in a comprehensive global review of coral restoration methods, incorporating data from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, complemented with grey literature and through a survey of coral restoration practitioners. We found that coral restoration case studies are dominated by short-term projects, with 60% of all projects reporting less than 18 months of monitoring of the restored sites. Similarly, most projects are relatively small in spatial scale, with a median size of restored area of 100 m2. A diverse range of species are represented in the dataset, with 229 different species from 72 coral genera. Overall, coral restoration projects focused primarily on fast-growing branching corals (59% of studies), and report survival between 60 and 70%. To date, the relatively young field of coral restoration has been plagued by similar \u2018growing pains\u2019 as ecological restoration in other ecosystems. These include 1) a lack of clear and achievable objectives, 2) a lack of appropriate and standardised monitoring and reporting and, 3) poorly designed projects in relation to stated objectives. Mitigating these will be crucial to successfully scale up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 303, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6041058767790396068", "cites_id": ["6041058767790396068"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226631", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pNJnQfEm1lMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 41, "2021": 90, "2022": 117, "2023": 53}}
