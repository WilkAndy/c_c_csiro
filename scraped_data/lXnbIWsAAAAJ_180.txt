This was contrasted with 2002, when cyclones were absent during the spawning. The effects of current and wind patterns on the dispersal of buoyant coral eggs was simulated using GCOM3D, a three dimensional hydrodynamic current model, and OILMAP, a surface wind stress model.Modelling showed that larvae could disperse across the North West shelf and well beyond the parent reefs when influenced by cyclone\u2010modified wind and current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15894326553342665206", "cites_id": ["15894326553342665206"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/JBI.12295", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9mEM3Mn9k9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
