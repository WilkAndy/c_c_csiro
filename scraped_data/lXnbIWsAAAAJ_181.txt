The aim of this project is to investigate important ecological thresholds and relationships to inform the management of COTS. To do this we use a range of modelling methods as well as analyses of all available empirical data. Data from the management program removals of COTS provide near-real-time CPUE (Catch-Per-Unit-Effort) data that can be used to inform management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16388721845744403901", "cites_id": ["16388721845744403901"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/handle/11017/2955", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vYVHArBvcOMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
