This project has determined the diversity, density   and species compositions of the fishes that occupy reefs, seagrass, unvegetated sand and nearshore surf zone habitats in three different types of management zones in the JBMP. The zones were (1) General use zones, where all types of fishing are allowed. (2) Scientific reference zones, where recreational and commercial rock lobster fishing and selected shore-based fishing activities are allowed. (3) Sanctuary zones, where no boat-based fishing is permitted. Future management of the marine park requires a sound understanding of the relationships among the fish faunas, both within and among the main habitat types in each of the different management zones, and of the variability that occurs at different spatial scales.  The vision provided by the management plan for the JBMP was: \u201cIn the year 2025, the marine flora and fauna, habitats and water quality of the Jurien Bay Marine Park will be in the same or better condition than in the year 2005. The area will support viable and ecologically sustainable fishing, aquaculture, recreation and nature-based tourism and the marine park will be considered an important asset by the local community\u201d (Anon., 2005). Key performance indicators, described in the management plan, were designed to ensure that this vision is met. This requires data on how  estimates of abundance of fishes varied according to the type of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14691589036347000929", "cites_id": ["14691589036347000929"], "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/6573/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YYh8oWMC48sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
