It brings together relevant published information as well as referring to reports and current ongoing research projects.The western rock lobster is one of the most abundant large invertebrates within the SWMR. It has a distribution ranging from shallow, inshore state waters to deep offshore reefs at depths of 150 m along the lower west coast of Australia. The western rock lobster has a complex, spatially segregated life-cycle, with juveniles aged up to 3 years predominating in shallow coastal lagoons< 12 m deep, adolescents 4-5 years present in coastal lagoons and deeper offshore waters (0-150 m), whilst mature adults\u2265 6 years are more abundant at depths of 30-150 m. It would therefore appear that the SWMR, containing waters predominantly outside coastal waters, comprises mainly adolescent and adult lobster. The proportion of total lobster biomass within the coastal lagoons (ca 87% at centre of distribution) is thought to be considerably higher than the proportion of lobster biomass further offshore within the SWMR. Lobster\u2265 4-5 years old are exploited by the fishery, which removes between 8,000 and 12,500 t of biomass per season. The recruitment of lobsters into the coastal lagoons is highly variable and is strongly influenced by the strength of the Leeuwin Current, whereby a strong Leeuwin Current increases the survival and settlement of larvae. At small spatial scales, lobster biomass can be highly variable, but at large spatial scales most of the biomass is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13027926099289467958", "cites_id": ["13027926099289467958"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glenn-Hyndes/publication/255590014_Western_rock_lobster_in_ecosystem_processes_of_south-western_Australia/links/548a53200cf2d1800d7aaa81/Western-rock-lobster-in-ecosystem-processes-of-south-western-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NmwwLMN9zLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
