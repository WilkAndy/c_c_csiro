Most locations showed lowest biomass in winter (eg Jurien, Marmion, Two Rocks and Bunbury) but others showed summer minima where the majority of sites were dominated by Sargassum. The proximal factors that drive these variations also differ among locations. Erosion of biomass is most likely to be the factor driving changes in Ecklonia dominated sites (Marmion, Two Rocks, Perth) while light limitation is likely to be a major factor at Bunbury. Where Sargassum dominates sites (Green Head) algal phenology can explain changes in biomass. In contrast to the pattern for biomass, algal community structure showed no seasonal trend which was also the case for invertebrates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=815557797887176727", "cites_id": ["815557797887176727"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Westera/publication/267720732_BENTHIC_ECOSYSTEM_STRUCTURE_SPATIAL_AND_TEMPORAL_VARIABILITY_IN_ANIMAL_AND_PLANT_DIVERSITY_Contributing_Investigators/links/548d93590cf2d1800d8261b7/BENTHIC-ECOSYSTEM-STRUCTURE-SPATIAL-AND-TEMPORAL-VARIABILITY-IN-ANIMAL-AND-PLANT-DIVERSITY-Contributing-Investigators.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F3DdBH9xUQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
