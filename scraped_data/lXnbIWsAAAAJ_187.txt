For habitat\u2010forming organisms in particular, understanding the relationship between larval connectivity and meta\u2010population dynamics aids in planning for marine spatial management. Here, we estimate networks of connectivity between fringing coral reefs in the northwest shelf of Australia by combining a particle tracking model based on shelf circulation with models of subpopulation dynamics of individual reefs. Coral cover data were used as a proxy for overall habitat quality, which can change as a result of natural processes, human\u2010driven impacts, and management initiatives. We obtain three major results of conservation significance. First, the dynamics of the ecological network result from the interplay between network connectivity and ecological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5552908645289979236", "cites_id": ["5552908645289979236"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZG20CP7kD00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
