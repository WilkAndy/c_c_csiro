At each location we sampled a variety of coral reef habitats on 4 separate occasions between 2006 and 2007. We tested for consistency in differences in the biomass of target and non-target species, trophic groups and overall assemblages. Generally, target species were more abundant and/or larger at protected locations. Many non-target species were either more abundant or depleted at protected sites, and some of these species were significantly larger or smaller. Trophic groups such as piscivores, piscivore invertivores, invertivores and planktivores were consistently more abundant within protected locations. Generally, greater numbers of species and individuals were found on protected reefs, though this was not consistent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13501694685066420366", "cites_id": ["13501694685066420366"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v524/p241-253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:juAp8cenX7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
