The literature describes many potential benefits of marine reserves to fisheries, including increases in spawner-biomass-per-recruit and increases in larval supply from protecting \u2018source\u2019 populations (Jennings 2000). The important word here is \u2018potential\u2019. Some claims made by advocates of marine reserves might be regarded as optimistic, whereas critics of reserves might sometimes have been unduly harsh. Conservation goals for marine reserves are often poorly defined, and differences of opinion regarding the efficacy of reserves for fulfilling any of their stated goals can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 289, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=957341742342975134", "cites_id": ["957341742342975134"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/burdens-of-evidence-and-the-benefits-of-marine-reserves-putting-descartes-before-des-horse/6BAF49AD98973A9EC2E49A3F727A0BB5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nq4BET4pSQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 14, "2005": 26, "2006": 29, "2007": 21, "2008": 24, "2009": 29, "2010": 17, "2011": 20, "2012": 13, "2013": 15, "2014": 21, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
