Reporting on size\u2010based indicators that link to food\u2010web structure can contribute to ecosystem\u2010based management, but the application of these indicators over large (cross\u2010ecosystem) geographical scales has been limited to either fisheries\u2010dependent catch data or diver\u2010based methods restricted to shallow waters (<20 m) that can misrepresent the abundance of large\u2010bodied fished species. We obtained data on the body\u2010size structure of 82 recreationally or commercially targeted marine demersal teleosts from 2904 deployments of baited remote underwater stereo\u2010video (stereo\u2010BRUV). Sampling was at up to 50 m depth and covered approximately 10,000 km of the continental shelf of Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1132129793662667540", "cites_id": ["1132129793662667540"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.13807", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FEvmjgwitg8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
