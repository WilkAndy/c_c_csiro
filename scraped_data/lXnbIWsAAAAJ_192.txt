The model comprised 80 functional groups (more than 200 species). The JBMP is a multiple use-marine park with several types of zoning and the effects of these on rock lobster biomass, mortalities and landings were explored using five Ecospace scenarios as baselines: (1) no-take Sanctuary Zones covering 4% of the total area; area of Sanctuary Zones changed to (2) 25%, (3) 50%; (4) 0%, i.e. No Sanctuary Zones; and (5) combining 25% of no-take areas with a 50% reduction in fishing mortality of the main targeted species. The results suggest that the introduction of the current management zones with 4% of the area in Sanctuary Zones produced a modest increase of \u223c5% in the biomass of western rock lobster \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17214906945445484870", "cites_id": ["17214906945445484870"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380012002360", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RtmujKii5-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
