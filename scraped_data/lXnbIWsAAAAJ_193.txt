This vast reproductive potential is a key factor which pre-disposes Acanthaster to large fluctuations in numbers, yet much of its reproductive behaviour is still poorly understood. On the Great Barrier Reef A. planci has been seen spawning in this characteristic arched posture on top of elevated rocks or corals, on reef fiats and at depths of 30 m. This spawning was recorded during the afternoon, but spawning has also been seen in the morning and after sunset. At this stage I can detect no lunar or tidal pattern to the timing of spawning. If there is no clear timing pattern then aggregation would be an obvious aid to fertilization. The peak of the spawning season is probably in December, when larger groups of spawning starfish (50-100) have been observed.
