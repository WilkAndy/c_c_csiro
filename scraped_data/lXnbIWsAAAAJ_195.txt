Acoustic tags were attached to turtles at Pelican Banks (n\u2009=\u200933) and Wiggins Island (n\u2009=\u200916). Between May 2013 and September 2014, tagged turtles were detected >\u20091.3 million times by 46 acoustic receivers. Data demonstrated variability in residence index and home range size between Pelican Banks and Wiggins Island that was largely attributed to larger body size at Pelican Banks and habitat differences. Tide had a significant influence of movement and habitat use. At Pelican Banks turtles moved into intertidal seagrass beds at high tide and retreated to the channel at low tide. At Wiggins Island \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9874322765875328288", "cites_id": ["9874322765875328288"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-021-03898-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IDWNOT2kCIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 8}}
