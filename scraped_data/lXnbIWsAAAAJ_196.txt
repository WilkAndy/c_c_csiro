These interventions have three components: the functional objective, the delivery method and the scale at which they can be applied. Functional objective types share intended benefits and have similar social and regulatory considerations. In most cases, the functional objective types contain multiple delivery methods. The first phase of the RRAP program examined the feasibility and benefits of a series of these, which are systematically described at the level of the delivery method in this report. The existing scientific evidence for the interventions and their potential benefits and risks were documented, and knowledge gaps highlighted"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13320096167681728356", "cites_id": ["13320096167681728356"], "pub_url": "https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/reef-restoration-and-adaptation-program-intervention-technical-su", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZB-2QOR82rgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
