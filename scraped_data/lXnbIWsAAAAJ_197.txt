Here, we aimed to identify the factors that shape macrophyte communities on shallow reefs in a region with limited anthropogenic impacts, but that is influenced by periodic disturbances from cyclones and marine heatwaves.Pilbara coast, Western Australia.Macrophyte species richness and biomass were assessed at 75 shallow reefs along 300 km of shoreline in November 2013 and May 2014. The influence of 28 predictor variables including seascape descriptors, physico\u2010chemical variables, and herbivore abundances were evaluated using distance based linear models (DistLM), redundancy analyses (dbRDA), and full\u2010subsets multiple regressions.We identified 188 macrophyte species; 60% were Rhodophyta, whereas Phaeophyceae made \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7372042067115575078", "cites_id": ["7372042067115575078"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13470", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JgephzPBTmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
