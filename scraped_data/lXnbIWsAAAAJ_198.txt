A range of grid sizes were used (10, 50, 100 and 250 m) to identify how model predictions were altered. Models were evaluated using the area under the curve of a receiver operator characteristic plot (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS) using a spatially independent dataset.Grid size had a large effect on model performance across the taxonomic groups. Model outputs were compared to null surfaces and 88.8% of models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10861928518894105871", "cites_id": ["10861928518894105871"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DzVeYHBSvZYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
