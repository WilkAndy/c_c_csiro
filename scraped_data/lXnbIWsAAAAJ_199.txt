In the present study we measured trends in the human use of no-take areas using observed vessel position and categorisation during on-water and aerial surveys before and after rezoning. Measured changes in spatial patterns of fishing showed that the effects of rezoning on most fishing activity was minimal. After rezoning, the proportion of recreational fishing declined from 6.3 to 2.6% of the footprint in the new MNPs. The proportion of commercial fishing declined from 25 to 1%, although the amount of commercial fishing was low. There was an overall increase in fishing activity on Moreton Bay. Low recreational fisher displacement suggests that the expansion of the MNP area did not have a high social cost. However, most of the no-take zones were areas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6325404592629157387", "cites_id": ["6325404592629157387"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF16400", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Cw5JrPZZyFcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
