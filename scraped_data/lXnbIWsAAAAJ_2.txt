Here we reveal a rapid climate-driven regime shift of Australian temperate reef communities, which lost their defining kelp forests and became dominated by persistent seaweed turfs. After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters. This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 1030, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15786658992665540196", "cites_id": ["15786658992665540196"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aad8745", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZDYOaLZ6FdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 16, "2017": 75, "2018": 133, "2019": 166, "2020": 183, "2021": 201, "2022": 180, "2023": 67}}
