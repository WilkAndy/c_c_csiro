Extensive control programs on the GBR involve manual culling of COTS in the field, and research is needed to inform these management efforts. Data from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority\u2019s (GBRMPA) COTS control program provide near-real-time CPUE (Catch-Per-Unit-Effort, COTS culled per minute) data ideal for operational decision-making but these must be converted to density estimates before they can be related to ecological status of reefs or incorporated into ecological models. We developed conversions between common COTS field survey methods (i.e. manta tow, SCUBA transect searches) and COTS control program CPUE data using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12487060001960435769", "cites_id": ["12487060001960435769"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-020-01981-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OSDXmenySq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
