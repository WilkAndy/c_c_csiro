We release a large-scale, annotated underwater image dataset from a COTS outbreak area on the GBR, to encourage research on Machine Learning and AI-driven technologies to improve the detection, monitoring, and management of COTS populations at reef scale. The dataset is released and hosted in a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning community with the task of COTS detection from these underwater images."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13692579290957636145", "cites_id": ["13692579290957636145"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MWJmmFHQBb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7}}
