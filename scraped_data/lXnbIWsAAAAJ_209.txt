The effects of varying the biomass of western rock lobster in the system were examined by simulating changes in commercial and recreational fishing mortality as well as recruitment-driven changes in the abundance of lobster puerulus (the first post-larval stage). The model comprised 80 functional groups (more than 200 species). A simulated closure of the commercial lobster fishing was predicted to lead to an increase in lobster biomass of 160% after 20 years, with changes in biomass of up to 20% of the main prey and predators of lobster. Since 2006/2007, the puerulus settlement (recruitment to the benthos) of western rock lobster has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13004096176473026545", "cites_id": ["13004096176473026545"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016578361300012X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8a-w55LUd7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
