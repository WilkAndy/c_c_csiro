However, simple conclusions about their effects on species richness are confounded, because more species are expected to occur wherever there are more individuals. Here, there is an important distinction between the number of species per sampling unit (species density), and species richness measured as the number of species per given number of individuals. When conservation of species richness is an important goal, analyses need to discriminate between the alternative explanations for differences in the number of species. We used rarefaction to test whether species richness was higher in two \u2018no-take\u2019 marine reserves after controlling for differences in the density of individuals. We surveyed each reserve in three different years. There was a higher density of individuals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5185219633155777076", "cites_id": ["5185219633155777076"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-012-2408-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NKKhrMiZ9UcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
