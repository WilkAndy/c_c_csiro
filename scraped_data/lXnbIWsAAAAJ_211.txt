Here we outline the multi-faceted intervention approaches that have developed in Australia since 2017, from newly implemented in-water programs, research to enhance coral resilience and investigations into socio-economic perspectives on restoration goals. We describe in-water projects using coral gardening, substrate stabilisation, coral repositioning, macro-algae removal, and larval-based restoration techniques. Three areas of research focus are also presented to illustrate the breadth of Australian research on coral restoration, (1) the transdisciplinary Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), one of the world\u2019s largest research and development programs focused on coral reefs, (2) interventions to enhance coral performance under climate change, and (3) research into socio-cultural perspectives. Together, these projects and the recent research focus reflect an increasing urgency for action to confront the coral reef crisis, develop new and additional tools to manage coral reefs, and the consequent increase in funding opportunities and management appetite for implementation. The rapid progress in trialling and deploying coral restoration in Australia builds on decades of overseas experience, and advances in research and development are showing positive signs that coral restoration can be a valuable tool to improve resilience at local scales (i.e., high early survival rates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6035227980249458054", "cites_id": ["6035227980249458054"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273325", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hmVEPd9vwVMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 5}}
