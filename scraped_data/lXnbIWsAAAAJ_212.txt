In marine ecosystems, one of the most important processes is the supply of new recruits into a population. Here, we investigated spatiotemporal variability in coral recruitment at 15 reefs throughout the Dampier Archipelago, north-western Australia between 2015 and 2017 and identified the best environmental predictors for coral recruitment patterns over this period. Large differences in recruitment were observed among years with the average density of recruits increasing by 375% from 0.017 recruits cm\u22122 in 2015 to 0.059 recruits cm\u22122 in 2017. Despite differences in recruitment among years, the rank order of coral recruit density among reefs remained similar among years, suggesting that spatial variation in recruitment within the Dampier Archipelago is partly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5925808428449137047", "cites_id": ["5925808428449137047"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014111362100074X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lwG6kF6zPFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
