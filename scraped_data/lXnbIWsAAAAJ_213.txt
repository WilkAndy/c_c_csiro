We studied how early successional communities changed across a 40 m depth gradient to test whether patterns of coral larvae settlement could be explained by changes in preferred settlement substrates. Light decreased 83-fold from 3 to 40 m, and coral settlement orientation switched from tile undersides at 3 and 8 m to tile topsides at 25 and 40 m as expected. Regardless of the reduction in light, community composition on the topsides of settlement tiles did not change across depths, being dominated by turf algae (49%), crustose coralline algae (CCA; 29%), and biofilmed tile (12%). In contrast, settlement tile undersides were dominated by coralline and fleshy algae at 3 m, transitioning to ascidians \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6314726458052516999", "cites_id": ["6314726458052516999"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-020-3670-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hxz7uUFqolcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
