Surveys have been conducted over four sampling periods, with a further two remaining. The results indicate that there are larger numbers of smaller lobster within the 40-60 mm carapace length range on shallow inshore reefs with high seagrass coverage. All sites have lobster within the 60 to 80 mm class, although densities are lower on the more offshore sites characterised by kelp pavement. However, a number of exposed sites have not been consistently sampled due to high swell conditions, and some seasons have not yet been repeated so any conclusions at this stage must be considered preliminary. In addition, gut samples and stable isotope samples have been collected from 193 lobster specimens obtained over two seasons from sites differing in surrounding benthic habitat. Early results indicate that articulated coralline algae, in particular, contributes the highest to overall diet in terms of volume consumed, and this holds true over all habitats. However, stable isotope analysis indicates that other food sources may contribute more to lobster production. Research into the movements of rock lobster is currently underway using acoustic transmitters and receivers. Results will emerge early next year and will help us understand home-range, foraging and migration patterns within coastal waters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3387736336205248754", "cites_id": ["3387736336205248754"], "pub_url": "http://www.srfme.org.au/reports/Collab-prog_rep-RockLobster-Nov05.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8ngysD-oAy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1}}
