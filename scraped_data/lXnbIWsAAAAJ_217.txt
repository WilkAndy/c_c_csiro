Within an information-theoretic framework, these measures account for changes in both species diversity and total biomass to describe (i) overall system change, (ii) sustainability to external pressure, (iii) shift from a baseline state and two types of resilience: (iv) ability to recover from local pressures and (v) overall potential to return to a baseline state. We apply these measures to study the behaviour of three computer models: a large 59-functional groups complex ecological model (Ecopath with Ecosim) of north Western Australia undergoing internal dynamics, a smaller 6-group coral reef model subjected to various combinations of single and multiple stressors and a prey\u2013predator model displaying limit cycles. We demonstrate the state-dependency of properties like resilience and sustainability by showing how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9449988635006280231", "cites_id": ["9449988635006280231"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/77/4/1532/5520595", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JyIHaZgaJYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
