We surveyed coral-reef fish and living hard coral in and adjacent to a sanctuary zone (SZ: where all forms of fishing are prohibited) in the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Marine Park during a 10-year period. There were generally more individuals and greater biomass of many fish taxa (especially emperors and parrotfish) in the SZ than the adjacent recreation zone (RZ: where recreational fishing is allowed)\u2014so log response ratios of abundance were usually positive in each year. However, despite this, there was an overall decrease in both SZ and RZ in absolute abundance of some taxa by up to 22% per year, including taxa that are explicitly targeted (emperors) by fishers and taxa that are neither targeted nor frequently captured (most wrasses and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17987039444347355493", "cites_id": ["17987039444347355493"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-019-52016-9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZYFDQRPNnvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
