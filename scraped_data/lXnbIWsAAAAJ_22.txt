Here we examine the potential contribution of light-dependent settlement in scleractinian coral planulae to patterns of vertical zonation. The effect of intensity and spectral quality of light on the settlement of six species of scleractinian corals (Goniastrea favulus Dana, Goniastrea aspera Verrill, Acropora tenuis Dana, Oxypora lacera Verrill, Montipora peltiformis Bernard, and Platygyra daedalea Ellis and Solander) with contrasting depth distributions was examined in laboratory trials. Light-dependent settlement was shown by planulae from five of the six species examined. Planulae from individual species showed a response to either light quality or light quantity, but not both. Settlement patterns shown by planulae from all six species were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 261, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8014993492059330526", "cites_id": ["8014993492059330526"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098197001676", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3pdDox36Om8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 6, "2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 11, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 11, "2009": 9, "2010": 12, "2011": 14, "2012": 14, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 21, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
