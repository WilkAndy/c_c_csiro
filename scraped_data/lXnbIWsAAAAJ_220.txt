The purpose of our analysis is two-fold: first, to provide a general insight into fish movement which allows us to approximately evaluate the efficiency of current local protected areas; second, to provide a statistical description of fish movement as input to ecological numerical models which can be used to evaluate alternative design for sanctuary zones.We analysed 3 months of data from 41 Spangled Emperors (Lethrinus nebulosus) in the Ningaloo Marine Park, in Western Australia. The data was collected via 38 acoustic receivers spread over an area of approx 180 km2 covering roughly 5 different habitats typical of shallow water, reef environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=833301780150076691", "cites_id": ["833301780150076691"], "pub_url": "https://www.per.marine.csiro.au/staff/Fabio.Boschetti/papers/Detecting%20general%20patterns%20in%20fish%20movement.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E8WL1I17kAsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
