For such systems, identifying mechanisms that limit the re\u2010establishment of critical positive feedbacks is key to facilitating recovery. Theory predicts the primary drivers limiting system recovery shift from biological to physical as abiotic stress increases, but recent work has demonstrated that this seldom happens. We combined field and laboratory experiments to identify variation in limitations to coral recovery along an environmental stress gradient at Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf in northwest Australia. Many reefs in the region are coral depauperate due to recent cyclones and thermal stress. In general, recovery trajectories are prolonged due to limited coral recruitment. Consistent with theory, clearer water reefs under low thermal stress appear limited by biological interactions: competition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14131332694812047170", "cites_id": ["14131332694812047170"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2558", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QrciBTeUHMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
