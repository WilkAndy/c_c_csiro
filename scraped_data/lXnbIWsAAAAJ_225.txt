This research examined a) how macroalgae affects coral recruitment and b) the processes which drive macroalgal abundance. These experiments were conducted in the field using a series of caged, uncaged and partially caged treatments to examine herbivory and control for caging effects. It was identified for the first time, that both the pre- and post- settlement processes of coral recruitment were severely reduced by increased macroalgal biomass. In the presence of macroalgae - for the coral Acropora millepora: larval settlement was reduced by up to 93%, post settlement survival was approximately half and those which did survive were around 80% smaller compared to corals in uncaged plots which contained little macroalgae \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2297937333290994958", "cites_id": ["2297937333290994958"], "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/10862/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Dg3rYtTp4x8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
