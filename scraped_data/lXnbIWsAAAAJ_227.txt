No significant difference was detected in catch per unit effort between locations. However, the catch around the marine reserve was made up of fewer, but larger lobsters than at Little Barrier Island, while the size and number of lobsters caught per trap haul at coastal Leigh was intermediate between the other two locations. Economic returns around CROP Marine Reserve were maintained by days of very high revenue per trap haul offsetting days of low or no revenue per trap haul. In comparison daily financial returns per trap haul were more stable at the other two sites. As a result overall returns per trap haul around the reserve were comparable with the other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7164423291567091537", "cites_id": ["7164423291567091537"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7164423291567091537&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:US9kYgYlbWMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
