Although the ecological responses of common coral taxa have been well documented, little is known about the ecological responses of uncommon coral taxa or of coral morphological groups across multiple adjacent reef zones. We used Multivariate Auto-Regressive State-Space modelling to assess the rate and direction of change of hard coral cover across a variety of coral genera, growth forms, and susceptibility to bleaching and physical damage covering multiple reef zones at northern Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. Trends were assessed between 2007 and 2016, during which multiple episodic disturbances occurred including cyclones and a heatwave. We provide evidence of zone specific trends, not only in total hard coral cover, but also in taxonomic and morphological groups of corals at Ningaloo \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12535138139893236553", "cites_id": ["12535138139893236553"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113620303032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SYPJZrnB9a0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
