Here we use experimental crosses to examine mating compatibilities and breeding barriers in a group of sessile animals whose mating systems are primarily governed by interactions among free-spawned gametes. We found hybridization occurs readily in more than one-third of 42 species pairs from the common genera Acropora, Montipora and Platygyra. Mean fertilization success ranged from 1% to 50% in species crosses, but standard deviations about these means were large and in some cases, fertilization success in individual colony matings was greater than 95%. Cases of high fertility in individual, interspecific matings were found in all three genera. Hybridization occurred most readily between species that were morphologically similar, identifying areas where current taxonomic judgements may require further testing. However, cases of significant hybridization also occurred between species that are morphologically distinct. Evidence of in vitro hybridization combined with the lack of either temporal or spatial barriers to interbreeding among field populations of these species, indicates that natural hybridization may occur commonly between congeneric corals that are currently recognized as distinct species. We also detected mating incompatibilities between some colonies within some species. In some cases, incompatible colonies corresponded to distinct morphotypes, but not in others. Thus some breeding groups in scleractinian corals are potentially larger, but others are smaller, than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8340952108752464211", "cites_id": ["8340952108752464211"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bette-Willis/publication/226863868_Experimental_hybridization_and_breeding_incompatibilities_within_the_mating_systems_of_mass_spawning_reef_corals/links/564e4ed508aefe619b0fcb49/Experimental-hybridization-and-breeding-incompatibilities-within-the-mating-systems-of-mass-spawning-reef-corals.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U2m8KsADwXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 9, "2004": 11, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 10, "2009": 14, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 9, "2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 16, "2023": 2}}
