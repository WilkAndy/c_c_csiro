Their use is based on the assumption that they display relatively constant discrimination between diet and consumer, so that differences between trophic levels are predictable (eg DeNiro and Epstein 1978, Minagawa and Wada 1984, Michener and Schell 1994). This assumption has been questioned and has received considerable attention (see Vanderklift and Ponsard 2003, Caut et al. 2009). However, far less consideration has been given to quantifying sources of within-species variability in \u03b415N and \u03b413C, although there is some recognition that such variation occurs spatially, temporally and among individuals (see Matthews and Mazumder 2004). Understanding the patterns of this variability will have implications for the way ecologists design surveys and experiments to address key ecological questions, and the way data are used in mixing models, which have become commonplace in recent years.Intra-species variation in stable isotopes can occur through variation across spatial and temporal scales and/or variation among individuals at a given time and place. Stable isotopes of macrophytes can vary spatially or temporally through changes in light, temperature, water depth and nutrient supply, which can alter rates of productivity and influence a producer\u2019s demand for carbon and therefore \u03b413C (Hemminga and Mateo 1996). Furthermore, differences in \u03b415N of ammonium and nitrate, which may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12481857755549059694", "cites_id": ["12481857755549059694"], "pub_url": "http://www.srfme.org.au/reports/SRFME_Eco_report_HYNDES_final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bsp0OH93OK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
