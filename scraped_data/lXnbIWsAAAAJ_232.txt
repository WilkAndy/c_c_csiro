The tasks of the expert groups included: \u2022 Synopsis of the theme, to include discussion on current state, primary drivers, pressures and responses using DPSIR framework. \u2022 Review of all current monitoring and modelling activities relevant to the expert group theme. \u2022 Identify candidate indicators that can be monitored and would provide information about trend, status or forecasting of value or the system. \u2022 Evaluation of the adequacy and confidence of current monitoring and modelling of candidate indicators, determined by their ability to meet the objectives of the RIMReP and management needs provided by the Authority.  \u2022 Identification and discussion of gaps and opportunities in current monitoring and modelling of such indicators.  \u2022 Evaluation of new monitoring technologies for their potential to increase efficiency or statistical power and their compatibility with long-term datasets. \u2022 Recommendations for monitoring design including consideration of primary indicators, continuity of data sets, how the design addresses management needs, modification to existing programs, costing and transition strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16682214797440431427", "cites_id": ["16682214797440431427"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/handle/11017/3562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q7Uz3Pghg-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
