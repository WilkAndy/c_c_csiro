Research supported by the Center ad-dresses nearshore nutrient dynamics, coral diseases, coral bleaching, ecology of secondary metabolites in algae and invertebrates, feeding biology and physiology of corals, bioerosion of reefs, effects of UV irradiation on corals, marine geology and more. Recently, the Center took over management of NOAA's mobile underwater saturation diving hab-itat, AQUARIUS, which will be used to augment the Center's Florida program. The habitat will first be deployed in the northern Keys and will later relocate several times during the next decade to encompass the range of physiographic regimes found throughout the region. Thus, several longterm coral reef study sites, with extensive biological and physical oceanographic baseline data, will be established as part of the Center's Florida program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:QyXJ3EUuO1IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10117894449930285741", "cites_id": ["10117894449930285741"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10117894449930285741&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rbL9MmX7aYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1}}
