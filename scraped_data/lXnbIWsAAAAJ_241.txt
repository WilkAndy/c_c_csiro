The potential of novel technologies to support coral reef monitoring within the Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program (RIMReP) framework was evaluated based on their performance, operational maturity and compatibility with traditional methods. Given the complexity of this evaluation, this exercise was systematically structured to address the capabilities of technologies in terms of spatial scales and ecological indicators, using a ranking system to classify expert recommendations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8451699904040386525", "cites_id": ["8451699904040386525"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/handle/11017/3568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3b-HoEh4SnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
