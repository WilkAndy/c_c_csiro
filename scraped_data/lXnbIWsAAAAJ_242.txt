Combined with shipboard systems, scientists are able to make in situ measurements of water column and benthic properties. In CSIRO autonomous gliders are used to collect water column data, while surface vessels are used to collect bathymetry information through the use of swath mapping, bottom grabs, and towed video systems. Although these methods have provided good data coverage for coastal and deep waters beyond 50m, there has been an increasing need for autonomous in-situ sampling in waters less than 50m. In addition, the collection of benthic and water column data has been conducted separately, and requires scientists to post-process data in lab. A new system was needed to allow for in-situ observations of both benthic habitat and water column properties in shallow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11354772664994203338", "cites_id": ["11354772664994203338"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7778651/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yoZLIpRBlJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
