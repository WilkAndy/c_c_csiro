Their distribution has been well documented in tropical and temperate habitats with many species recorded in Australian waters also distributed across the Indo-Pacific region. This is primarily due to larval connectivity among fish assemblages which is driven by oceanic currents. Fishes are ecologically and economically important and in some cases exert an influence on the structure of food webs and habitats. However, they are susceptible to impacts from fishing, climate change, coastal development and unplanned hydrocarbon discharges. Fishes have complex life histories that vary among species but typically include both pelagic and demersal stages that may expose them to a range of potential impacts from unplanned discharges and exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons. In light of such potential risks, the aim of this review is to provide a current state of knowledge examination of the consequences of unplanned oil discharges for fishes within the Australian context.Crude oils contain hydrocarbons, metals, phenols and organic acids. The composition of crude oil is reservoir-specific, so the toxicity of each crude oil will vary. The addition of chemical dispersants to an oil discharge increases the level of toxicity to fishes compared to crude oil alone. Monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are generally regarded as the most toxic components of oil to fishes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13156897389896165620", "cites_id": ["13156897389896165620"], "pub_url": "https://www.appea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/APPEAWhitePaper_Fish_Rev1_Final-Submission.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9GgGx3ewlrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
