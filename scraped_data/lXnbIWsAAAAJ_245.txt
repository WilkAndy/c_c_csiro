Significant scientific advances in support of a more strategic approach to regional planning have been made. It is clear that presentation of whole-of-ecosystem understanding in a useable and management-relevant form means that our coastal managers, policy makers and decision takers will be better equipped to deliver socially, economically and environmentally sustainable communities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11092461381039518774", "cites_id": ["11092461381039518774"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11092461381039518774&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NnSZDdtW8JkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
