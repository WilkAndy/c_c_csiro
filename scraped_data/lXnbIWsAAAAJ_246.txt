At the heart of co\u2010management and stewardship is co\u2010learning. It is in management's interest to determine the optimal approach to conserving biodiversity in marine protected areas. To achieve public confidence and trust, it is essential that the best management approaches are applied and that stakeholders are involved in the decision\u2010making process. Little research has focused on shared or co\u2010learning for improving management outcomes. This study aims to understand the mechanisms of sustainability learning systems and processes to improve existing management strategies. The study is based on a desk\u2010top analysis of literature and planning instruments.
