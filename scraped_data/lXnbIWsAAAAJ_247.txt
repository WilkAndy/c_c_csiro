Unfortunately these rare, and as yet incomplete, examples of good quality work are overwhelmed by too many examples of poor quality analysis. The scoping and definition of terms used to describe impacts in the marine environment needs further work, particularly the meaning of the term \u2018local\u2019. The joint venturers do not appear to have used a systematic hazard analysis tool to identify and prioritise impacts in the marine environment, and there is no evidence that the beliefs and values of stakeholders and community groups have been formally acknowledged or incorporated into the assessment. Regional risk arguments used in Chapter 11 are not supported by an equivalent regional assessment and are not therefore risk averse.The level of detail and quality of analysis varies dramatically between marine taxa. Disproportionately large sections of Chapter 11 and the technical appendices are dedicated to potential impacts on coral and some (but not all) species of turtles. The level of detail and quality of work directed to other primary producer communities and protected marine species is cursory and poor. Chapter 11 identifies 45 marine ecosystem components/processes that are directly related to the assessment endpoints and potentially threatened by the construction and operation activities of the Gorgon Gas development. The chapter, however, only specifies performance indicators for 5 of these. The chapter goes on to specify some performance targets but the approach is neither consistent in coverage (targets are only specified for 26 of the ecosystem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=69472681159558134", "cites_id": ["69472681159558134"], "pub_url": "https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/Proponent_response_to_submissions/A1496_R1221_ERMP_RTS_CSIRO%20Final%20report%20Gorgon.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9gMcEgnR9gAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
