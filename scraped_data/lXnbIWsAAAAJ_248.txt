One of SRFME\u2019s core research projects, Coastal Ecosystem and Biodiversity in Western Australia has as a primary objective the \u2018provision of representative baseline assessments\u2019. It is imperative that these surveys be based on reliable and consistent taxonomic information if they are to provide meaningful habitat and community characterizations. This project uses the taxonomic expertise of John Huisman to ensure consistent and accurate identifications of the macroalgae. In addition to the benefits to CSIRO core research, this project will contribute to \u2018FloraBase\u2019, a CALM endeavour to document information regarding Western Australia\u2019s plant life.
