Only by studying changes that occur in MPAs following protection can we assess the true value of MPAs as baseline reference areas for quantifying ecosystem effects of fishing in the coastal zone, and the success of current conservation and fisheries management strategies. Potential benefits of MPAs include those related to protection of spawner biomass and conservation of critical habitats.In order to properly determine whether changes observed within MPAs are the result of protection rather than natural variation in space and time, scientifically-credible baseline surveys within and adjacent to proposed MPAs are needed prior to protection from fishing, with subsequent survey of locations at biologically meaningful time intervals. Ideally, baseline surveys should be conducted over several years to assess the scale of inter-annual variability before the MPA is declared."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12896279313832334761", "cites_id": ["12896279313832334761"], "pub_url": "http://www.srfme.org.au/reports/srfme_link_JurienMP.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qdUxYbXJ-LIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
