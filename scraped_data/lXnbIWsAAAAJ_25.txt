During experimentally induced spawnings, measured fertilization rates for broadcast eggs were high. More than 70% of the eggs were fertilized at distances as great as 8 m downstream from a single spawning male starfish, and more than 20% were fertilized at separations of more than 60 m. Fertilization was still measurable, at 5.8%, 100 m downstream. Lateral diffusion of sperm away from the axis of flow produced fertilization rates of 13.8% at 8 m normal to the flow and 32 m downstream. The large volumes of sperm released by male A. planci are the primary cause of high rates of fertilization for eggs derived from widely spaced individuals.
