Acanthaster brevispinus has not previously been regarded as a threat to corals or coral reefs. Here, we report A. brevispinus occurring on mesophotic off-reef or inter-reef habitats in 20\u201370-m depths dominated by solitary corals off both the western and eastern coasts of Australia. On Ningaloo Reef, A. brevispinus were found on mushroom coral (Cycloseris distorta) beds using an underwater towed camera and further exploration using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) confirmed predation by A. brevispinus on C. distorta. On the southern Great Barrier Reef, A. brevispinus in large numbers were found in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-023-02351-1", "cites_per_year": {}}
