LocationWe compiled the first comprehensive empirical dataset for coral communities in the south-eastern Indian Ocean (SEIO), incorporating information from 392 sites along the western coast of Australia and offshore atolls/islands across 19 degrees of latitude.  MethodsWe assessed hard coral cover and community composition to genus using point-intercept transects or point-count analysis of digital images taken along transects. We explored spatial variation in environmental conditions and in composition of corals with contrasting life histories. After de-trending the temporal patterns, we assessed the relative importance of environmental metrics to coral cover, life histories and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11590217854777388074&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
