Two survey methodologies were used; baited underwater video and underwater visual census. Snapper (Pagrus auratus), the most heavily targeted fish species in the region, showed no difference in abundance or size between the Marine Park and adjacent control areas. When compared to the fully no-take Poor Knights Island Marine Reserve and two other reference areas open to all kinds of fishing (Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands), the abundance and size of snapper at the Marine Park were most similar to fished reference areas. In fact, the Marine Park had the lowest mean numbers and sizes of snapper of all areas, no-take or open to fishing. Baited underwater video found that pigfish (Bodianus unimaculatus), leatherjackets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4908946763197973699", "cites_id": ["4908946763197973699"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320703001836", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wwS4iRIVIEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 18, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 7, "2010": 13, "2011": 19, "2012": 10, "2013": 18, "2014": 18, "2015": 12, "2016": 13, "2017": 12, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
