This review considers advances in our understanding of the biology and ecology of CoTS based on the resurgence of research interest, which culminated in this current special issue on the Biology, Ecology and Management of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish. More specifically, this review considers progress in addressing 41 specific research questions posed in a seminal review by P. Moran 30 years ago, as well as exploring new directions for CoTS research. Despite the plethora of research on CoTS (>1200 research articles), there are persistent knowledge gaps that constrain effective management of outbreaks. Although directly addressing some of these questions will be extremely difficult, there have been considerable advances in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8294525185011815761&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
