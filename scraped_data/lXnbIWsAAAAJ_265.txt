The ARP has delivered improved baseline understanding of the status and spatial variability in populations of commercially and ecologically important finfish of the Browse Basin region, in the vicinity of the Prelude and Ichthys fields, using both commercial-style fish traps and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) as sampling methods. We used available environmental-data layers and fish-distribution data, in combination with modelled plume projections, to design a study such that sites were balanced with respect to fish habitat and likely affected and unaffected zones \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/aj/aj16251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gpBcDmkZ2PsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
