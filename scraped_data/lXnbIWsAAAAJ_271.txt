Despite uncertainty about the underlying causes of outbreaks and the management responses that might address them, few studies have critically and directly compared competing hypotheses. This study uses qualitative modelling to compare hypotheses relating to outbreak initiation, explicitly considering the potential role of positive feedbacks, elevated nutrients, and removal of starfish predators by fishing. When nutrients and fishing are considered in isolation, the models indicate that a range of alternative hypotheses are capable of explaining outbreak initiation with similar levels of certainty. The models also suggest that outbreaks may be caused by multiple factors operating simultaneously, rather \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=623978915233657537&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
