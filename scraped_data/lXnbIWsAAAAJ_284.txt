We used a meta-analytical approach to assess coral cover data across latitudes 10-35 degrees S along the west Australian coast, including 25 years of data from the Ningaloo region. Current estimates of coral cover ranged between 3 and 44% in coral habitats. Coral communities in the northern regions were dominated by corals from the families Acroporidae and Poritidae, which became less common at higher latitudes. At Ningaloo Reef coral cover has remained relatively stable through time (similar to 28%), although north-eastern and southern areas have experienced significant declines in overall cover. These declines are likely related to periodic disturbances such as cyclones and thermal anomalies, which were particularly noticeable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1452851660207639112&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
