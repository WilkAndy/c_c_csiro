Detailed results of WAMSI Project 3.1. 3 (Stock assessment of target invertebrates at Ningaloo Reef) are presented, but where appropriate the data on lobsters from two WAMSI studies (Projects 3.1. 3 & 3.2. 2d), is integrated, as these were purposely designed to be spatially complimentary, resulting in a more comprehensive stock assessment within the NMP."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=330268195186630597&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xV-1dixZlQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
