These physical factors interact with each other and with the life history and ecology of marine ecosystems making prediction of the ecological effects of climate change a challenging task.Temperature is a principal shaper of the abundance and distribution of coastal marine life such as intertidal fauna and seaweeds, kelp on subtidal reefs and seagrasses. Fluctuations in species abundances and community composition have been linked to variations in temperature while range shifts associated with ocean warming are documented from other temperate coastal ecosystems. Direct evidence of range shifts of coastal benthic species in Australia is still rare, probably reflecting the scarcity of data from Australia, but there is indirect evidence that climate change has already influenced coastal marine life in Australia including giant kelp and other brown algae in Tasmania."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://wamsi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2021/01/A-Changing-Climate-abstract-papers.pdf#page=37", "cites_per_year": {}}
