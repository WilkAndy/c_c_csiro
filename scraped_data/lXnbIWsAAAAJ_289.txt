The abundance of lobsters of all species were low, however there were regions that held significantly higher abundances of lobsters. The geographic regions and habitats types in which lobsters were found varied with lobster species. The Western Rock Lobster Panulirus cygnus was most abundant in the southern area of the marine park, where high abundances were found in coastal reef areas, especially shoreline reefs in Batemans Bay formed of eroded beach rock. Other species such as P. versicolor and P. ornatus were also more common on coastal attached reefs rather than offshore reefs, however these species were most abundant in the north. The centre of P. cygnus distribution was around Batemans Bay, where the Dugong Sanctuary zone has been in existence since 1990. In Batemans Bay, the density of P. cygnus was two orders of magnitude higher in the sanctuary zone than in adjacent areas, however the mean size inside the Sanctuary was significantly smaller than outside it. At Northwest Cape the Lighthouse Sanctuary zone had significantly higher numbers of P. versicolor than adjacent areas outside it but given the large size of most of these animals, it is unlikely that this is an effect of the recent rezoning which took place in 2006. The strong influence of habitat on lobster abundance and population structure makes it imperative that monitoring of newly created Sanctuary zones is continued in order to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://wamsi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2021/01/Node-3.2.2d-Lagoon-Invertebrates.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hoI-HXg6y4QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
