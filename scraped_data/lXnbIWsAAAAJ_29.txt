These observations are designed to help characterize changes in benthic assemblage composition and cover derived from precisely registered maps collected at regular intervals. This information will provide researchers with the baseline ecological data necessary to make quantitative inferences about the long-term effects of climate change and human activities on the benthos. Incorporating a suite of observations that capitalize on the unique capabilities of AUVs into Australia's integrated marine observation system (IMOS) [1] is providing a critical link between oceanographic and benthic processes. IMOS is a nationally coordinated program designed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13464817169771533050", "cites_id": ["13464817169771533050"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6174326/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-hLQUeCj3LoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 16, "2014": 11, "2015": 19, "2016": 27, "2017": 28, "2018": 22, "2019": 19, "2020": 22, "2021": 18, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
