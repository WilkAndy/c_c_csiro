The mass balanced model had 80 functional groups (more than 200 species), included data from 14 fishing gears and was fitted/calibrated with data on estimates of biomass for western rock lobster. The effect of climate change on the food web was evaluated through downscaling changes in primary productivity as predicted by a climate model (CSIRO Mk 3.5). ECOSIM simulations were carried out as the first attempt to understand how climate change will affect small marine ecosystems, a necessary step before predictions on global warming projections can be made.  Results from the model included assessing the impact of modified primary production (represented by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/20139/", "cites_per_year": {}}
