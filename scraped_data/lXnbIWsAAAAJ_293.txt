During the winter: the coast is dominated by the poleward Leeuwin Current, a warm, lowsalinity/nutrient current that effectively suppresses upwelling along the coast. During the summer: strong winds drive coastal counter currents; the northward flow of the Ningaloo Current promotes upwelling adjacent to reef.
