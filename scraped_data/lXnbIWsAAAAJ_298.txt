The goal of the SRFME study into benthic (sea floor) ecosystem dynamics was to advance the understanding of human impacts on these ecosystems and communities through a set of focussed studies addressing the relative influences of exposure to wave action (the dominant physical disturbance) and fishing by humans (ie direct and indirect trophic interactions).Several discrete studies addressed the influence of wave action. One approach compared modelled wave-induced forces with species richness of macroalgae collected as part of the coastal ecology programme. A key finding was that diversity of assemblages of reef algae was related to the wave-energy regime they experience. Quadrat level species diversity was highly correlated with wave exposure, with much of the variance in species composition explained by wave exposure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.srfme.org.au/reports/srfme_core_BenthicDynamics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s1tpqvtiiOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
