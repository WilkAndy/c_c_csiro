The data invalidate the generalization that most corals have internally fertilized, brooded planula larvae. In every species observed, gametes were released; external fertilization and development then followed. The developmental rates of externally fertilized eggs and longevities of planulae indicate that planulae may be dispersed between reefs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 908, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4877298008404093321", "cites_id": ["4877298008404093321"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.223.4641.1186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iWmllrKkr0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 7, "1985": 13, "1986": 14, "1987": 10, "1988": 15, "1989": 12, "1990": 14, "1991": 16, "1992": 12, "1993": 6, "1994": 14, "1995": 12, "1996": 14, "1997": 20, "1998": 8, "1999": 12, "2000": 15, "2001": 14, "2002": 38, "2003": 19, "2004": 23, "2005": 26, "2006": 29, "2007": 22, "2008": 35, "2009": 39, "2010": 27, "2011": 28, "2012": 36, "2013": 30, "2014": 27, "2015": 39, "2016": 44, "2017": 29, "2018": 37, "2019": 32, "2020": 37, "2021": 29, "2022": 36, "2023": 6}}
