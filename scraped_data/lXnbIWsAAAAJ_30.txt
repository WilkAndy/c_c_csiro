Consequently, the potential of habitat selection by larvae to contribute to these patterns has been largely ignored. To test whether larvae prefer substratum conditioned in the parental habitat, the larvae of 6 common coral species, with contrasting depth distributions, were introduced to aquaria containing settlement tiles conditioned at 2 and 12 m (shallow and deep), plus unconditioned tiles. Goniastrea aspera and G. retiformis, reef-flat species, settled on shallow tiles in densities 4 times greater than on deep tiles. Fungia horrida, a species locally restricted to deeper water, was 6 times more abundant on deep tiles. F. repanda, with a similar distribution, settled exclusively on deep tiles.
