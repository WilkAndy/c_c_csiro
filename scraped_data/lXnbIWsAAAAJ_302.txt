For example, the narrow temperature tolerance (26 degrees or 27 degrees to 30 degrees or 31 degrees C) reported for Acanthaster's larval development (2) is problematic because Acanthaster occurs where temperatures do not rise into this range (3, 4). We have further examined some temperature relationships in Acanthaster's early development. Cleavage proceeded normally over a range of about 10 degrees C, but specific limiting temperatures depended upon the geographic source of the parents or their recent history of temperature exposure. Hatched, swimming gastrulae continued normal development to bipinnaria throughout \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6801729809368373003&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C1eWeTmZZF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
