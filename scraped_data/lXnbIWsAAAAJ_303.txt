These populations are thus reproductively active, despite most species being at the extreme southern limit of their latitudinal range (28-degrees-29-degrees-S). In the present study, coral mass spawning occurred in the same month on both temperate (Houtman-Abrolhos) and tropical (Ningaloo) reefs of Western Australia, despite more than two months difference in the timing of seasonal temperature minima between the two regions. This concurrence in the month of spawning suggests that temperature does not operate as a simple direct proximate cue for seasonal spawning synchrony in these populations. Seasonal variation in photoperiod may provide a similar and more reliable signal in the two regions, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=837814437841378903&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
