Relatively large volumes of water can be filtered without the need to maintain contact with or return to the surface. These attributes confer a high degree of flexibility in subsurface sampling situations. Although we used the equipment to sample the eggs of invertebrates, it could equally easily be used to sample other small, patchily distributed plankton."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12643434954135601160&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CIACXhqBdq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
