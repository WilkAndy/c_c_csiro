During experimentally induced spawnings, measured fertilization rates for broadcast eggs were high. More than 70% of the eggs were fertilized at distances as great as 8 m downstream from a single spawning male starfish, and more than 20% were fertilized at separations of more than 60 m. Fertilization was still measurable, at 5.8%, 100 m downstream. Lateral diffusion of sperm away from the axis of now produced fertilization rates of 13.8% at 8 m normal to the now and 32 m downstream. The large volumes of sperm released by male A. planci are the primary cause of high rates of fertilization for eggs derived from widely spaced individuals. Models of sperm diffusion using high sperm release rates such as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13980110372054208429&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rY8LR1BUA8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
