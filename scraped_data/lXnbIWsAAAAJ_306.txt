Gonad development in females and males of A. planci peaked in early December 1991. Mean gonad volume then decreased by about 50% following a major spawning in which at least two-thirds of the population participated. Mean gonad volume recovered to near prespawning values by mid January, despite a further minor spawning that was observed in the population. Further spawnings are likely to have occurred in mid- to late January.  Fertilization rates measured during natural spawnings of A. planci were highest (83%) in samples taken at the peak of a major spawning event and much lower (23%) in samples taken at the end of the same spawning event. Trials conducted with starfish artificially induced to spawn indicated that potential fertilization rates decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3701178856580320172&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
