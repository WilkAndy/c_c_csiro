A considerable amount of research has been undertaken in that time mainly in order to determine why these events occurred and whether they may have been induced through some anthropogenic means.Not surprisingly, the literature which has accumulated on the starfish is extensive and a number of reviews (eg Potts 1981, Moran 1986, Endean and Cameron 1990) have been written which have synthesised our understanding of the phenomenon. The most recent and comprehensive of these works has been that produced by Birkeland and Lucas (1990)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/bitstream/11017/3190/1/MORAN_ETAL_CROWN_OF_THORNS_STARFISH_SYNOPSIS_RESEARCH.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EtoSL40Dgu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
