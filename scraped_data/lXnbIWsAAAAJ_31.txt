Our observations were made both opportunistically and on a systematic basis between 1978 and 1992 on the central and northern Great Barrier Reef. Spawning was predictable in some of the species observed, for example Bohadschia argus, Euapta godeffroyi, and Stichopus variegatus (Holothuroidea), which exhibited regular lunar and diel periodicity. Others, such as Holothuria coluber, Actinopyga lecanora, and Bohadschia graffei (Holothuroidea), Acanthaster planei (Asteroidea), Hyotissa hyotis and Arca spp. (Bivalvia) exhibited no clear lunar or diel periodicity in spawning behaviour. Mass heterospecific spawnings which involved several species, often from different phyla, were commonly observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=587339196778612156", "cites_id": ["587339196778612156"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924259.1992.9672274", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vAWnOuOlJggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 7, "1997": 10, "1998": 7, "1999": 6, "2000": 8, "2001": 3, "2002": 11, "2003": 4, "2004": 10, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 8, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
