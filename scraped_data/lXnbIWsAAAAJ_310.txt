PhD thesis, James Cook University.", "citation": "", "author": "Russell Clayton Babcock", "abstract": "The populations of Goniastrea asoera, G. favulus and P. sinensis on which this study is based are situated on the reef fiats of the fringing reefs of two inshore high islands in the Central Great Barrier Reef. These were Geoffrey Bay at Magnetic Island, and Pioneer Bay at Orpheus Island (Fig. 2.1). These reefs are subject to a higher degree of fine sedimentation than reefs further offshore for several reasons. These are principally the input of silt from coastal rivers, the resuspension of bottom sediment in the relatively shallow waters surrounding the islands, and the resuspension of sediment from the shores of the islands themselves. While the reefs of both Islands are quite similar in many respects all the above factors result in a higher rate of sedimentation at Magnetic island since it is situated closer to the mainland. The two sites also differ in that the reef at Geoffrey Bay faces the prevailing south easterly wind and swell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/24092/2/02whole.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mYEw6SXXa3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
