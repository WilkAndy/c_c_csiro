Here, we review published literature to determine our current understanding of how no-take marine reserves (ie green zones) benefit fish, and shape ecological functions in numerous ecosystems within the Moreton Bay Marine Park. Over the past decade, 16 peer-reviewed studies have examined \u2018reserve effects\u2019 for fish and associated ecological processes in Moreton Bay; this work was mostly conducted in the central part of the Bay in coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Most studies showed enhanced fish abundance, diversity, or both, inside reserves and increases in the levels of functions performed by fish (eg greater grazing rates). The degree to which reserves enhance the abundance of fish and their functions was contingent on two key conditions. Reserves that were better connected (ie those in proximity to complementary habitat types and situated in a more complex seascape) and those located in clearer water typically perform better and may also be more resilient. Therefore, these two factors must be strongly considered during future deliberations about expanding or modifying reserves in Moreton Bay. We identify a number of information gaps that are likely to impede improvement to the current network of no-take reserves, namely, research on sandy and muddy bottoms, ocean beaches, fishing outside of reserves, and pivotal ecological functions other than herbivory. Reserve design and future rezoning can take advantage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://moretonbayfoundation.org/articles/performance-of-marine-reserves-for-fish-and-associated-ecological-functions-in-the-moreton-bay-marine-park/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IjVeNgOvsQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
