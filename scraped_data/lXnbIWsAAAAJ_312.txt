In conjunction with measured trends in the human use of no-take areas before and after rezoning (previously reported by the authors (37)), we documented vessel use and characteristics of vessels in MBMP by way of on-water and aerial surveys. About 35% of vessel-based activity in the marine park was non-extractive use. Fishing was the dominant activity in the MBMP (65%), both within Moreton Bay itself and on nearby offshore waters, and recreational fishing comprised 97% of all fishing activity. Despite a thirty-fold increase in no-take area in the MBMP, there was minimal change in the spatial distribution of all on-water activities, including recreational fishing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://moretonbayfoundation.org/articles/non-extractive-human-use-and-vessel-characteristics-on-moreton-bay-following-marine-park-zoning/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vr3KQ8dMlj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
