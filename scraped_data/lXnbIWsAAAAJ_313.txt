Whilst the primary motivation for increased protection was the conservation of the various representative habitats within the Marine Park, another expected outcome of restricting fishing activities was to increase the abundance and biomass of target species. In order to determine whether there had been any changes in the abundance and biomass of targeted species within the areas closed to fishing, we examined the catch rates, size structure and sex ratios of mud and sand crabs and catch rates and biomass of a number of species of selected line-caught fish species at seven Marine National Park Zones (MNPZ; no-take) within the inshore areas of the Marine Park. We also used Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) to examine the relative abundance and biomass of fish at three MNPZs in the offshore area of the Marine Park. Survey sites were located within the newly established no-take zones (hereafter termed New green zones), nearby areas open to fishing and in areas that had been closed to fishing since 1997 (hereafter termed Old green zones). Catch rates and the size of mud crabs and yellowfin bream were higher within the two Old green zones compared to the New green zones or Open areas. However, sand crabs did not show any significant responses to zoning in any of the MNPZs surveyed. Catch rates and mean weight of snapper increased rapidly in the New green zone at St Helena Island. In the offshore areas of the marine park, the average biomass of the fishing target \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://moretonbayfoundation.org/articles/changes-in-fish-and-crab-abundance-in-response-to-the-moreton-bay-marine-park-rezoning/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ebmQY4LoDZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
