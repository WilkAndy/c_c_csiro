The facility will incorporate a suite of observing programs that capitalize on the unique capabilities of AUVs into IMOS, and will provide a critical observational link between oceanographic and benthic processes. IMOS has, and will maintain, a strategic focus on the impact of major boundary currents on continental shelf environments, ecosystems and biodiversity. To support a more complete understanding of natural, climate change, and human-induced variability in shelf environments, the facility will generate physical and biological observations of benthic variables that cannot be cost-effectively obtained by other means.Data streams to be produced will include precisely geo-referenced benthic imagery, multibeam swath bathymetry, Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) profiles and fluorometer data measuring chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), turbidity (scattering in red) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), at the benthic reference sites.
