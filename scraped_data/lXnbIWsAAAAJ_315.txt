Changes in the current Management Plan include extending the Marine Park southwards to incorporate the full extent of the reef, increasing the number and extent of Sanctuary Zones, introducing Special Purpose Benthic Protection and shore-based line fishing zones. The purpose of this project is to assess the effectiveness of 1989 Management Plan and also provide what will become the first data point in a long-term data set. These data will become an integral part of several sections of the NRP, evaluating the effectiveness of zoning for biodiversity conservation, assessing the implications of zoning for fish populations and for fishing outside sanctuary zones. The surveys will provide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14360996050477820714&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
