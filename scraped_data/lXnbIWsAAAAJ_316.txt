NRETA has connected Australian acoustic telemetry science with the Census of Marine Life\u2019s (CoML) Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project in North America and the $35 million worldwide acoustic tracking initiative proposed by R O\u2019Dor\u2013Ocean Shelf Tracking and Physics Array (OSTAPA). NRETA will be a key factor in the development of shelf tracking arrays within Australia as part of AATAMS and will place Australia in a good position to take a leading role as this technology continues to expand worldwide.
