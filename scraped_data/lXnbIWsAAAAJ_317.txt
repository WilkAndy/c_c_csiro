Survey data has been used to investigate the abundances of potentially important fauna across differeing habitat types and have confirmed that patch structure is an important and ubiquitous characteristic of Marmion Lagoon benthic communities, with strong implications for biodiversity and productivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1764478807471863880&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
