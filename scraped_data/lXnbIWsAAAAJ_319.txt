How surrounding waters interact with and support reefs is generally complex and poorly documented, despite the obvious importance of such information for understanding reefs\u2019 ecological function and for effective management aiming to minimise the impact of activities in and around reef environments. Reefs may depend nutritionally on filtering large volumes of adjacent ocean water [eg 1], and nutrient delivery may thus depend on both local and regional currents. We postulate the novel idea of a biogeochemical oceanic \u201ccatchment\u201d area, which may cover thousands of square kilometres, overlapping with anthropogenic developments previously considered sufficiently distant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14865105051435302080&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wHyqG0l2S84J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
