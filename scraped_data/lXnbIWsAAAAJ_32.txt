Gonad development in females and males of A. planci peaked in early December 1991. Mean gonad volume then decreased by about 50% following a major spawning in which at least two-thirds of the population participated. Mean gonad volume recovered to near prespawning values by mid January, despite a further minor spawning that was observed in the population. Further spawnings are likely to have occurred in mid- to late January. Fertilization rates measured during natural spawnings of A. planci were highest (83%) in samples taken at the peak of a major spawning event and much lower (23%) in samples taken at the end of the same spawning event. Trials conducted with starfish artificially induced to spawn indicated that potential fertilization rates decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 190, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1525869567785472317", "cites_id": ["1525869567785472317"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF9920525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PZFumUn6LBUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 13, "1995": 8, "1996": 10, "1997": 6, "1998": 10, "1999": 1, "2000": 6, "2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 17, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
