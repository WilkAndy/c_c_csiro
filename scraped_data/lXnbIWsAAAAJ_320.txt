The sites are located on reefs in the Marmion Marine Park with each site approximately 2500 m2 in extent. The sites are comprised of a patchy mosaic of kelp forest, mixed algal canopy, and low foliose algal assemblages. At each site nine circular areas measuring 3m in diametre have been cleared of all algae and changes in percent cover of algae monitored over an 18 month period using photo quadrats (0.25 m2). The successional process observed within circular clearances have been used to help understand the causal mechanisms underlying patch formation and maintenance at Marmion Reef."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1574755119238086300&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
