The extent of connectivity is, therefore, predicted to also influence the outcomes of conservation initiatives, such as marine reserves. Here we review the published evidence about how important seascape connectivity (i.e. landscape connectivity in the sea) is for marine conservation outcomes.Global.We analysed the global literature on the effects of seascape connectivity on reserve performance.In the majority of cases, greater seascape connectivity inside reserves translates into better conservation outcomes (i.e. enhanced productivity and diversity). Research on reserve performance is, however, most often conducted separately from research on connectivity, resulting in few studies (<\u20095% of all studies of seascape connectivity) that have quantified how connectivity modifies reserve effects on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9991612561977140762", "cites_id": ["9991612561977140762"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12388", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gmb68a9WqYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 17, "2018": 30, "2019": 21, "2020": 25, "2021": 23, "2022": 29, "2023": 5}}
