The development of gametes was similar in both species, but there was no evidence for an adolescent protandrous period of development in G. aspera such as that recorded for G. favulus at Heron Island. Other reproductive differences between the two species were found in egg size and the mode of spawning. The eggs of G. aspera are smaller and more numerous than those of"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7310989338739655576", "cites_id": ["7310989338739655576"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R-Babcock/publication/225236199_Reproduction_and_distribution_of_two_species_of_Goniastrea_Scleractinia_from_the_Great_Barrier_Reef_Province/links/57eaefc508ae91a0c8d3f38d/Reproduction-and-distribution-of-two-species-of-Goniastrea-Scleractinia-from-the-Great-Barrier-Reef-Province.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mMM-fBHadWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 10, "1987": 8, "1988": 4, "1989": 1, "1990": 5, "1991": 4, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 4, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
