Montipora digitata Dana, 1845 (Scleractinia: Coelenterata) is a hermaphroditic coral which reproduces bi-annually, releasing egg-sperm bundles during the mass spawning at Magnetic Island (19\u00b010\u2032S; 146\u00b052\u2032E) in late spring-early summer, and autumn each year. The buoyant egg-sperm bundles float to the surface where they break apart, releasing eggs and sperm into the ocean. Fertilisation occurs after \u223c30 min. Unfertilized eggs were collected, washed free of sperm, and freeze-dried. The eggs were extracted with dichloromethane, fractionated by chromatography on silica gel, and the fractions assayed for their ability to attract M. digitata sperm. The active fraction was further fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, resulting in the isolation of three highly unsaturated fatty alcohols: (1) dodeca-2,4-diynol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9027820980801706236", "cites_id": ["9027820980801706236"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00349783", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_BiBwFlDSX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 5, "2006": 8, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 12, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
