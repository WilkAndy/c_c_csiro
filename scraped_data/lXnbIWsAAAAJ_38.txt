Settlement and juvenile survival of the coral Acropora millepora were measured in situ using experimentally elevated sedimentation rates. Sedimentation rates ranged between 0.76-1.32 mg. cm-2. d-1 for reference sites and 1.88-11.70 mg. cm-2. d-1 in sediment treatments. Settlement was significantly lower in the sediment treatments where it reached only 71% of levels in reference areas. The number of juvenile corals surviving at sediment treated sites after 8 months was 39% of levels at reference sites, however mortality did not vary significantly between treatments. These effects indicate that even relatively small increases in sediment accumulation would have negative impacts on coral recruitment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6848785822743690671", "cites_id": ["6848785822743690671"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=fab3ba576809e4bab768f8bda6abbcffda41b14f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r31eW2vGC18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 11, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
