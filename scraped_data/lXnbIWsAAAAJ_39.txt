We found differences in assemblages among regions separated on a scale of~ 10s of kilometres. Of the environmental variables measured in the present study (depth, temperature, water current speed), current speed had the greatest influence on the structure of pelagic assemblages. Carcharhinus galapagensis, Seriola rivoliana and Scomber australasicus had similar distributions and were associated with low flow environments. Seriola lalandi was associated with the higher flow environments sampled during our surveys, although current speeds in the sample area were relatively slow (0.03 to 0.34 ms\u20131; mean 0.17 ms\u20131). Relationships between pelagic assemblages and current speed were detected when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1822125592105616069", "cites_id": ["1822125592105616069"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v350/p255-266/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xYKabZJ9SRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 19, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 18, "2021": 12, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
