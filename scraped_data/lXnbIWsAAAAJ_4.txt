During the predicted times, 105 species from 36 genera and 11 families were observed to spawn. Of these, 15 species were shown to have an annual gametogenic cycle. All but two of the species observed during mass spawnings shed gametes which underwent external fertilization and development. Synchronous spawning was observed both within and between the five reefs studied, which were separated by as much as 5\u00b0 of latitude (500 km) or almost a quarter of the length of the Great Barrier Reef. The mass spawning of corals took place on only a few nights of the year, between the full and lastquarter moon in late spring. Maturation of gametes coincided with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 902, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5666867568237114888", "cites_id": ["5666867568237114888"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00428562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CHb0aQfCpE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 3, "1987": 7, "1988": 11, "1989": 6, "1990": 13, "1991": 12, "1992": 13, "1993": 9, "1994": 17, "1995": 10, "1996": 13, "1997": 24, "1998": 17, "1999": 20, "2000": 14, "2001": 11, "2002": 33, "2003": 26, "2004": 30, "2005": 26, "2006": 23, "2007": 27, "2008": 32, "2009": 39, "2010": 24, "2011": 36, "2012": 39, "2013": 35, "2014": 23, "2015": 33, "2016": 45, "2017": 33, "2018": 35, "2019": 29, "2020": 37, "2021": 41, "2022": 31, "2023": 18}}
