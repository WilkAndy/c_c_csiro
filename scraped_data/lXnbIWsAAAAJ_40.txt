Long-term data from before and after the establishment of MPAs provide a rare but valuable opportunity to assess these effects. In this study we present long-term data (1977\u20132005) from before and after park establishment, on the abundance of spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii from fixed sites in a no-take marine park and a recreationally fished marine park, to assess the efficacy of no-take vs. partial protection. Lobster densities were comparable between both marine parks prior to park establishment, but the response of lobster populations differed markedly following protection. On average, legal-sized lobster were eleven times more abundant and biomass 25 times higher in the no-take marine park following park establishment, while in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11722854707837409123", "cites_id": ["11722854707837409123"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320706001509", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YxcqFj_yr6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 11, "2009": 14, "2010": 5, "2011": 11, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 5}}
