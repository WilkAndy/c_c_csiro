Each of the species shed eggs and sperm into the water, with subsequent external development of larvae. Studies of gamete viability indicated that cross-fertilizations were possible until at least 6 h after spawning.Montipora digitata cross-fertilized exclusively,Acropora tenuis, Goniastrea aspera andG. favulus were capable of self-fertilization, but to varying extents. In all species, cross-fertilization was the dominant mating pattern."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18083187776759818232", "cites_id": ["18083187776759818232"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00569127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-Gd0YHlj9PoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 5, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
