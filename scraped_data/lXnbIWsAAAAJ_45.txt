The effects of reef\u2010associated predators were examined in northeastern New Zealand by comparing soft\u2010sediment assemblages at sites having different densities of large predators. Large rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) were 3.8 times more abundant, and large snapper (Pagrus auratus) 12 times more abundant, on average, at reserve sites compared with non\u2010reserve sites. The overall structure of infaunal communities differed between areas with high predator densities (reserve) and those with lower densities (fished). Sites with consistently higher densities of snapper and lobster were found to have a lower biomass of two bivalve species, and the greatest decreases were found near the reef edge (2\u20135 m). For several fauna a strong gradient in their density with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 135, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10083005089727486003", "cites_id": ["10083005089727486003"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/04-0234", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M5ipAbUH7osJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 11, "2009": 6, "2010": 9, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
