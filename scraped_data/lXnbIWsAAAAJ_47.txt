Consequently, there is a recognized need for better information on fish movement behaviour at the appropriate spatial scales to generate more realistic interaction models. Automated ultrasonic tracking of marine fish, applied in this study, offers the potential to continuously track individuals for periods of up to several years within the study area. Snapper (Pagrus auratus) (FL: 33\u201368 cm) were surgically implanted with individually coded ultrasonic transmitters to monitor their movement within the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve in northeast New Zealand from October 2001 to September 2002. The range of movement patterns observed includes some fish resident for the entire tracking period, while others were more mobile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4258488860968716371", "cites_id": ["4258488860968716371"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/61/7/1137/880649", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U4j_fQ4xGTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 13, "2014": 13, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
