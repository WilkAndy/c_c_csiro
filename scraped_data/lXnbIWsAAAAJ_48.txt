The Poor Knights and 2 reference locations, Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands, were sampled biannually for 4 yr using baited underwater video (BUV). Following the implementation of full marine reserve status at the Poor Knights in October 1998, snapper showed significant increases in abundance and biomass relative to fished control locations. This was particularly apparent for large snapper (> 270 mm), whose numbers increased rapidly to levels 7.4 times higher in the final survey compared to the initial pre-reserve survey, and total snapper biomass increased by 818%. There was no significant increase in the abundance, biomass or size of snapper at the reference locations over this time. There was a strong seasonal trend in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3445957587908562611", "cites_id": ["3445957587908562611"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v272/p183-190/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sw5aMiuA0i8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 14, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
