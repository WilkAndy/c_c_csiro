We tagged snapper (Pagrus auratus (Bloch & Schneider 1801)) in the Leigh Marine Reserve, New Zealand using visible implant fluorescent elastomer tags, recoverable by diver visual sightings without the need to recapture the fish. Batch tagging of snapper (n = 907) was done during an angling survey in June and December 1996, and individually coded tags were implanted by divers (n = 117) in January 1999. Snapper tagged during both programmes were recovered on irregular intervals from 1997 to 2000. There were 71 recoveries of batch tags within 500 m of their tagging sites, and these recoveries were still being made >3 years after tagging: Of individually coded fish, 49 (42%) were seen, sometimes repeatedly over several months \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9989442762499686720", "cites_id": ["9989442762499686720"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.2001.9517024", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QAHkIkShoYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 15, "2004": 6, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
