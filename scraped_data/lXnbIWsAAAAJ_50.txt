Current knowledge of the ecology of New Zealand\u2019s subtidal reefs is limited, being based on studies from a small number of locations. In this study, surveys of shallow subtidal reef communities were carried out at 43 locations (247 sites) throughout mainland New Zealand. National and regional patterns in community structure are described, and their relationships with environmental variables are investigated. The shallow reefs (< 12 m depth) surveyed were generally typical of temperate systems, being dominated by large leathery seaweeds. However, other algal groups, sponges, mussels, ascidians and bryozoans were also abundant at some places where large seaweeds were rare, eg locations subjected to extreme wave action and poor water clarity (Raglan, Karamea, Cape Foulwind, Jackson Head), or where sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) were abundant (Gannet Rock, Abel Tasman, Nelson, Paterson Inlet). Strong associations were found between the biological patterns and environmental conditions such as water clarity and wave exposure, but these associations differed among regions. This unprecedented New Zealand-wide survey of subtidal reefs provides a framework for marine conservation planning and further ecological study, and a valuable baseline for assessing change associated with environmental variation, human-related impacts and management actions (eg marine reserves)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7301099839251827622", "cites_id": ["7301099839251827622"], "pub_url": "http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sfc280.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pktE9J63UmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 16, "2020": 15, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
