Given such circumstances, the presence of several mechanisms to prevent polyspermy (too many sperm) may seem paradoxical; however, a growing body of data suggests that natural fertilization levels, though variable, can routinely be high. Under such conditions, polyspermy is much more likely. The tension between sperm limitation and polyspermy represents sexual conflict because males, in competing to fertilize as many eggs as possible, can impose lethal costs on eggs if multiple sperm gain entry. Here we present data for a marine invertebrate indicating high levels of polyspermy under sperm\u2010limited conditions. When the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus was induced to spawn in situ, mean rates of polyspermy were  \\documentclass{aastex \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4489357347332872853,17503203952698727774", "cites_id": ["4489357347332872853", "17503203952698727774"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/342075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ldqQxbhmTT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
