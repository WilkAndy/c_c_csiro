The existence of morphologically distinct sympatric coral populations despite such an event implies the presence of isolating mechanisms to prevent hybridization and maintain species boundaries. Over 380 fertilization trials were conducted to determine the extent of reproductive isolation among the seven morphologically defined species (morphospecies) of the scleractinian coral genus Platygyra, on the Great Barrier Reef. Results from these experiments demonstrate that fertilization between-morphospecies can occur at rates equivalent to within-morphospecies fertilizations, indicating that no gametic-level barriers to fertilization exist among these morphological species. Observations of spawning times both in the field and in the laboratory have shown that all seven morphospecies spawn on the same night \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10912388334164919556", "cites_id": ["10912388334164919556"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/1542579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BEUEpV-XcJcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 7, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 11, "2003": 6, "2004": 11, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
