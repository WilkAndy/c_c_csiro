Field survey data showed size-specific patterns of mussel residency on a variety of rocky shore floral and faunal substrata.  Primary settlement (<0.5 mm), both in the laboratory and in the field, was largely on the hydroid Amphisbetia bispinosa and the turfing algae Corallina officinalis, Champia laingii, and Laurencia thyrsifera.  In the field, postlarvae between 0.5 and 5.5 mm occurred mostly on the algae C. officinalis, C. laingii, L. thyrsifera, Melanthalia abscissa, Pterocladia lucida, Gigartina cranwellae, and Gigartina alveata.  Juvenile and adult mussels (>5.5 mm) were resident predominantly on P. lucida, G. alveata, and Pachymenia himantophora.  Size-frequency data from established mussel beds indicated low levels of primary settlement, with the majority of recruitment coming from secondary settlement of larger individuals. Recruitment patterns were consistent with Bayne's primary-secondary settlement model.  Substrata deployed onto and near the shore for 21 days recruited both a primary settlement cohort and a secondary settlement cohort of mussels too large to have originated from primary settlement. Differential residency patterns in the field and settlement/recruitment experiments suggested a change in substratum preference by juveniles as a function of size and age.  It is suggested that mucus drifting was the likely means of movement for young postlarvae among habitats.
