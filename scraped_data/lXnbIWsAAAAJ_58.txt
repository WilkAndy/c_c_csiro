However, the mechanisms that underly vertical zonation of hard corals are poorly understood. Two alternative conceptual models for the maintenance of vertical zonation are considered; depth-dependent settlement of larvae, or indiscriminant settlement of larvae with distributions determined by differential post-settlement mortality with depth. These alternative models were evaluated by undertaking field translocation experiments using 10 d old juveniles of 3 species with contrasting adult distributions: Goniastrea aspera (Verrill)\u2039 restricted to shallow reef flat habitats; Oxypora lacera (Verrill)\u2039 restricted to low light, lower slope habitats; and Platygyra daedalea (Ellis and Solander)\u2039 a species with a broad depth range. Laboratory-raised larvae of each species were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17170204960526524513", "cites_id": ["17170204960526524513"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v198/p109-119/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YWDVoHDSSO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 8, "2007": 9, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
