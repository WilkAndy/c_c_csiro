Retention rate after surface tagging longline\u2010caught fish was 93% over a 2\u2010week period, with no mortality attributable to tagging. Incidence of fin or scale infection did not differ between tagged and control fish. A protocol for tagging snapper underwater was also developed. This technique caused less stress to the fish than remote fishing methods, but was labour intensive when large sample sizes were required. Orange VIFE tags were visible to divers at ranges of up to 6 m in water visibility of 8\u201310 m, when exposed to light frequencies capable of inducing fluorescent emissions. Red, green, and yellow tags were only identifiable at shorter ranges, depending on ambient light levels and direction.
