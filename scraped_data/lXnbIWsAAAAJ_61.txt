Such information is necessary to develop sound conservation and management strategies. Kelps are main habitat-formers in temperate reefs worldwide; however, these habitats are highly sensitive to environmental change. The kelp Ecklonia radiate is the major habitat-forming organism on subtidal reefs in temperate Australia. Here, we provide large-scale ecological data encompassing the latitudinal distribution along the continent of these kelp forests, which is a necessary first step towards quantitative inferences about the effects of climatic change and other stressors on these valuable habitats. We used the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) facility of Australia\u2019s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) to survey 157,000 m2 of seabed, of which ca 13,000 m2 were used to quantify kelp covers at multiple spatial scales (10\u2013100 m to 100\u20131,000 km) and depths (15\u201360 m) across several regions ca 2\u20136\u00b0 latitude apart along the East and West coast of Australia. We investigated the large-scale geographic variation in distribution and abundance of deep-water kelp (>15 m depth) and their relationships with physical variables. Kelp cover generally increased with latitude despite great variability at smaller spatial scales. Maximum depth of kelp occurrence was 40\u201350 m. Kelp latitudinal distribution along the continent was most strongly related to water temperature and substratum availability. This extensive survey data, coupled with ongoing AUV missions, will allow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9992180206137964469", "cites_id": ["9992180206137964469"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118390", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tfeK5vRaq4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
