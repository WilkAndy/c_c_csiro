(-)-Epi-thunbergol was not present in the tissues of the releasing colony. Using fluorocarbon droplets impregnated with the chemotactic molecules and a videomicroscopic technique for the direct observation of sperm under the influence of attractant molecules, we showed that (-)-epi-thunbergol, whether isolated from L. crassum or from a gorgonian octocoral (Briareum sp.), significantly attracts sperm from L. crassum colonies. Attraction could be detected using direct observation at concentrations as low as 3.25 \u03bcg ml-1. This is the first evidence for sperm chemotaxis in the Alcyonacea.
