Reef systems north of 18\u00b0S have been impacted by heat stress and coral bleaching during strong El Ni\u00f1o phases and those further south during strong La Ni\u00f1a phases. Cumulative heat stress and the extent of bleaching throughout the northern reefs in 2016 were higher than at any other time on record. To assess the changing regime of disturbance to reef systems across Western Australia (WA), we linked their site-specific exposure to damaging waves and heat stress since 1990 with mean changes in coral cover. Since 2010, there has been a noticeable increase in heat stress and coral bleaching across WA. Over half the reef systems have been severely impacted by coral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16052019000641422242", "cites_id": ["16052019000641422242"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-019-01795-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ooMN3Ts6xN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 12, "2020": 17, "2021": 22, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
