This presents a challenge for managers who must choose appropriate large\u2010scale spatial frameworks for systematic conservation planning. We demonstrate how systematically collected community data can be used to evaluate existing biogeographic classifications, identify the most appropriate metric for biogeographic patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, and develop an independent biogeographic classification scheme for systematic conservation planning. We evaluated 6 existing biogeographic classifications for New Zealand's nearshore marine environment with community\u2010similarity metrics derived from abundance and presence\u2013absence data for macroalgae (107 species) and mobile macroinvertebrates (44 species).
