A caging experiment was used to test the hypothesis that patterns observed were caused by predation, using plots seeded with a known initial density of the bivalve Dosinia subrosea to estimate survivorship. The caging experiment was replicated at several sites inside and outside two highly protected marine reserves: predators are significantly more abundant inside these reserves. Survivorship in fully caged, partially caged and open plots were then compared at sites having either low (non reserve) or high (reserve) predator density. The highest rates of survivorship of the bivalve were found in caged plots inside reserves and in all treatments outside reserves. However, inside reserves, open and partially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17013464493465966713", "cites_id": ["17013464493465966713"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-005-0148-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eZjCy9D3G-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 11, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
