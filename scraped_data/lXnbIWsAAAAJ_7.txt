We carried out experimental studies in two temperate marine reserves to examine these top-down influences on shallow subtidal reef communities in northeastern New Zealand. Both reserves examined are known to support high densities of predators and tethering experiments showed that the chance of predation on the dominant sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, within both reserves was approximately 7 times higher relative to outside. Predation was most intense on the smallest size class (30\u201340 mm) of tethered urchins, the size at which urchins cease to exhibit cryptic behaviour. A high proportion of predation on large urchins could be attributed to the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation on the smaller classes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 594, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17152827983498980153", "cites_id": ["17152827983498980153"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-002-0920-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OSvW4SsWC-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 12, "2004": 22, "2005": 24, "2006": 20, "2007": 34, "2008": 30, "2009": 43, "2010": 24, "2011": 30, "2012": 36, "2013": 33, "2014": 36, "2015": 36, "2016": 31, "2017": 31, "2018": 24, "2019": 38, "2020": 27, "2021": 31, "2022": 12, "2023": 11}}
