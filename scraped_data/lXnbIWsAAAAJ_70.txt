For example, the narrow temperature tolerance (26\u00b0 or 27\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 or 31\u00b0C) reported for Acanthaster's larval development (2) is problematic because Acanthaster occurs where temperatures do not rise into this range (3, 4). We have further examined some temperature relationships in Acanthaster's early development. Cleavage proceeded normally over a range of about 10\u00b0C but specific limiting temperatures depended upon the geographic source of the parents or their recent history of temperature exposure. Hatched, swimming gastrulae continued normal development to bipinnaria throughout a temperature range of 13\u00b0C.
