Restoration of coastal marine ecosystems is perceived by many to be expensive and prone to failure, in part explaining its low rates of implementation compared with terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, marine ecosystem restoration is a relatively new field, and we argue that assessments of its potential to answer this call should not rely on typical outcomes, but also to learn from successful outliers. Here, we review successful restoration efforts across a suite of metrics in coastal marine systems to highlight \u2018bright spots\u2019. We find that, similar to terrestrial systems, restoration interventions can be effective over large spatial expanses (1,000s\u2013100,000s ha), persist for decades, rapidly expand in size, be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16096321006889579848", "cites_id": ["16096321006889579848"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220315992", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SLVPfqyeYd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 14, "2022": 43, "2023": 14}}
