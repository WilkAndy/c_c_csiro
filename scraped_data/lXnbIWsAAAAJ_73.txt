We used the large\u2010scale experimental framework of four marine reserves, spanning an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New Zealand, to test the extent to which the exploitation of reef predators can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary production. We provide evidence that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus auratus) and lobster (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations but not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413C) of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in reserve and fished sites within four locations revealed that fishing indirectly reduced the proportion of kelp\u2010derived organic carbon assimilated by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16918966613396626602", "cites_id": ["16918966613396626602"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/07-1777.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qhwzjn4-zOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
