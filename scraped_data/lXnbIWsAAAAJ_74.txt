Successful MPAs ultimately depend on knowledge-based decision making, where scientific research is integrated into management actions. Fourteen coral reef MPA managers and sixteen academics from eleven research, state and federal government institutions each outlined at least five pertinent research needs for improving the management of MPAs situated in Australian coral reefs. From this list of 173 key questions, we asked members of each group to rank questions in order of urgency, redundancy and importance, which allowed us to explore the extent of perceptional mismatch and overlap among the two groups. Our results suggest the mismatch among MPA managers and academics is small, with no significant difference among the groups in terms of their respective research interests, or the type of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9069187870309526352", "cites_id": ["9069187870309526352"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479712005634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UKsUQ1E63H0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 4}}
