There was virtually no correlation between the two data sets. The most obvious failure was the inability of the model to generate the extreme patchiness which was observed in larval distributions. This patchiness is caused by the fine-scale three-dimensional flows which occur around topographically complex structures such as coral reefs. Although the model did predict the development of larval patches, they were not as concentrated and showed a different spatial and temporal pattern compared to the field data. Time-averaged model predictions were also compared to coral recruitment patterns, but these too showed no correlation with the observed patterns. This study suggests that fully three-dimensional models with a small grid size are required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12904775284572766114", "cites_id": ["12904775284572766114"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027843439290049P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oj8zt7_4FrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 8, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
