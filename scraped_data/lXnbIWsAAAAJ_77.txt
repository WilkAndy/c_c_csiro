In females up to 34 % of the body mass could be devoted to gonad. Based on these data, we also derived relationships between diameter gonad weight and reproductive output for both male and female starfish. Due to the large average size of individuals in this study (39.2 \u00b1 0.3 cm diameter), the potential oocyte production of females was between 29 and 38 million eggs per season for average size starfish. The highest oocyte production was estimated to be >100 million oocytes, which is the highest ever recorded for an individual female starfish. These relationships imply that the largest Acanthaster reported may have fecundities greater than 200 million eggs per season. The gonad mass of male starfish is similarly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6377674357876688508", "cites_id": ["6377674357876688508"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-016-3009-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fIZbwgkNglgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 15, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 16, "2021": 14, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
