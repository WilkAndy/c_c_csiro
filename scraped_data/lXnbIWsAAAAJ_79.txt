The success of each early life-history stage can vary in response to population density, interacting with intrinsic (e.g. behavioural) and environmental (e.g. competition, predation) factors. Here, we used the common reef-building coral Acropora millepora to investigate how density-dependence influences larval survival and settlement in laboratory experiments that isolated intrinsic effects, and post-settlement survival in a field experiment that examined interactions with environmental factors. Larval survival was exceptionally high (greater than 80%) and density-independent from 2.5 to 12 days following spawning. By contrast, there was a weak positive effect of larval density on settlement, driven by gregarious behaviour at the highest density. When larval supply was saturated, settlement was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1830178319771883791", "cites_id": ["1830178319771883791"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.170082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D9mfMXwZZhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 15, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
