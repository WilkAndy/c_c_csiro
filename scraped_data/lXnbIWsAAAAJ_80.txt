Protected-area design should be based on detailed movements of target animals; however, such data are lacking for most species. To address this, 25 sharks from three species were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored with a network of 103 receivers to determine the use of a protected area at Mangrove Bay, Western Australia. Movements of a subset of 12 individuals (Carcharhinus melanopterus [n= 7]), C. amblyrhynchos [n= 2], and Negaprion acutidens [n= 3]) were analysed over two years. Residency for all species ranged between 12 and 96%. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos had< 1% of position estimates within the MPA, compared to C. melanopterus adults that ranged between 0 and 99%. Juvenile sharks had high percentages of position estimates in the MPA (84\u201399%).
