These data were processed by inversion of a semi-analytical shallow water optical model to classify the substrate. Inputs to the optical model include water column constituent specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs), view and illumination geometry, surface condition (based on wind speed) and normalised reflectance spectra of substrate types. A sub-scene of the HyMap data covering approximately 4 km2 was processed such that each 3\u00d73 m2 pixel was classed as sand, seagrass, brown algae or various mixtures of these three components. Coincident video data were collected and used to estimate substrate types. We present comparisons of the habitat classifications determined by these two methods and show that the percentage validation of the remotely sensed habitat map may be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8483690733556776971", "cites_id": ["8483690733556776971"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434311001324", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C8DsDcYfvHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
