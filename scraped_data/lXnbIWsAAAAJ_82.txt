We used remotely sensed images to identify distinctive halos around patch reefs in the lagoon of Ningaloo Reef, the world\u2019s largest fringing coral reef. Thirty-four halos were identified along the length of Ningaloo Reef. Five halos located within a 122 km tract of the reef were investigated. The halos extended> 90 m from each central patch reef and were found to be associated with a high biomass of, and intensive grazing by, herbivorous fish, especially the large-bodied Kyphosus sydneyanus. Large brown algae mainly of the genera Sargassum, Dictyopteris and Lobophora were the dominant macroalgae, but were almost absent immediately adjacent to the patch reefs. Other taxa of herbivorous fish were present near the patch reefs, including Naso spp., Siganus spp. and Scarus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16554791824879084721", "cites_id": ["16554791824879084721"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v482/p217-225/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sWR1JHRvvuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
