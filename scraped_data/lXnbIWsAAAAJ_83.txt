Transferable predictive models could therefore provide time\u2010 and cost\u2010effective tools for understanding biodiversity\u2013environment relationships. We used fish species counts and spatial and environmental predictors to develop predictive models of fish species richness (S) for two major coral reefs located in separate ocean basins: Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR; Queensland) and Ningaloo Reef (NR; Western Australia). We tested the ability of the GBR model to predict S at NR (its transferability) under various scenarios using different sampling durations, years sampled and transect sizes. Based on R2, the GBR model poorly predicted S at NR (R2 < 16%) with few predicted values strongly correlated with observations. However, comparable spatial patterns in S across NR were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17749435420908937067", "cites_id": ["17749435420908937067"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.12578", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a18Di3mpUvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 12, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
