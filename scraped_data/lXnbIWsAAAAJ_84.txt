Density of lobsters was ~34 times higher in the sanctuary, and density of lobsters above minimum legal size around 50 times higher than in other areas around the island where recreational fishing is allowed. Mean carapace length (CL), total biomass and egg production of lobsters in the sanctuary zone were significantly higher than in adjacent fished areas. Large individuals (\u2265100 mm CL), especially large males, were found almost exclusively within the sanctuary. The abundance of mature animals in these shallow waters indicates that not all P. cygnus migrate to deep water and that shallow water habitats may currently be well below carrying capacity in terms of biomass and egg production \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13769917081613024189", "cites_id": ["13769917081613024189"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF06204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vbsgLKGSGL8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
