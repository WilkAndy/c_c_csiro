These large-scale networks are now generating big data, allowing meta-analyses across multiple species, locations, and temporal scales. Broad-scale comparisons of animal movement metrics are constrained by the use of diverse analytical techniques among researchers. Accordingly, there is a need for a tool-set to assist in calculating animal movement metrics that can be easily applied to datasets from local studies to large-scale cooperative networks. We present a standardised framework and an associated analysis tool-set that facilitates the calculation of a range of activity space and movement metrics for passive telemetry datasets. Application of the tool-set is demonstrated using data from the Integrated Marine Observing System continental-scale network of underwater acoustic receivers. We show how the metrics can: (1) be directly compared among multiple species monitored at multiple sites; (2) be compared among multiple species tagged at a single study site; and (3) assess changes in activity space metrics over time. Establishing a framework and tool-set to analyse data from large-scale networks progresses the field of passive telemetry beyond the traditional individual-, species-, or location-centric approaches to facilitate national- or international-scale outputs that better address important questions in the field of movement ecology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17498099286549215136", "cites_id": ["17498099286549215136"], "pub_url": "https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-018-0162-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oDdIm5e81fIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 12, "2021": 19, "2022": 15, "2023": 9}}
