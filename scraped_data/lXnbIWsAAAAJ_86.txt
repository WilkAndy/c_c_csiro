Previous attempts show varying levels of success at localized scales, but comparisons of cost and benefits to evaluate large\u2010scale reef restoration approaches are lacking. Here, we compare two large\u2010scale restoration approaches: the harvesting, development, and release of wild coral spawn slicks onto a target reef, with the transplantation of gravid coral colonies to provide a seed population and local source of larvae. Comparisons incorporate the best available information on demographic rates to estimate population growth, beginning at embryo production to colony maturity 4 years following deployment. Cost\u2010effectiveness is considered in a coarse manner. The harvesting, development, and controlled release of coral spawn slicks is anticipated to achieve large\u2010scale restoration of coral communities with low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15009315546765372997", "cites_id": ["15009315546765372997"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.12918", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ra6yjvfMS9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 15, "2021": 19, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
