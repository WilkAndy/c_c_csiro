Continental-scale acoustic telemetry networks are increasingly being established worldwide, producing large volumes of information-rich geospatial data. During the last decade, the Integrated Marine Observing System\u2019s Animal Tracking Facility (IMOS ATF) established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia. Simultaneously, IMOS developed a centralised national database to foster collaborative research across the user community and quantify individual behaviour across a broad range of taxa. Here we present the database and quality control procedures developed to collate 49.6 million valid detections from 1891 receiving stations. This dataset consists of detections for 3,777 tags deployed on 117 marine species, with distances travelled ranging from a few to thousands of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7426337116787021623", "cites_id": ["7426337116787021623"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017206", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N5dj5EKmD2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 16, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
