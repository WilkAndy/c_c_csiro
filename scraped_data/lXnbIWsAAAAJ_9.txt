This was a result of a trophic cascade thought to be an indirect effect of increased predator abundance. We assessed further changes in communities from 1996 to 2000, differences in benthic communities between reserve and adjacent unprotected sites, and the stability of these patterns from 1999 to 2001. Since 1996, densities of sea urchins Evechinus chloroticus have continued to decline in shallow areas of the reserve (< 8 m), and all sites classified as urchin barrens in 1978 are now dominated by large brown algae. Comparisons between reserve and non-reserve sites revealed differences consistent with a trophic cascade at reserve sites. The greatest differences in algal communities between reserve and non-reserve sites occurred at depths where E \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 451, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12158058929869464068", "cites_id": ["12158058929869464068"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v246/p1-16/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BKIiOS4auqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 8, "2004": 16, "2005": 21, "2006": 15, "2007": 27, "2008": 24, "2009": 29, "2010": 26, "2011": 24, "2012": 21, "2013": 32, "2014": 30, "2015": 26, "2016": 27, "2017": 27, "2018": 14, "2019": 20, "2020": 19, "2021": 26, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
