This type of data is of interest to marine scientists studying benthic habitats and organisms. AUVs collect georeferenced images over an area with consistent illumination and altitude, and make it possible to generate broad scale, photo-realistic 3D maps. Marine scientists then typically spend several minutes on each of thousands of images, labeling substratum type and biota at a subset of points. Labels from four Australian research groups were combined using the CATAMI classification scheme, a hierarchical classification scheme based on taxonomy and morphology for scoring marine imagery. This data set consists of 407,968 expert labeled points from around the Australian coast, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2856024568025157624", "cites_id": ["2856024568025157624"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-I_tdjajoicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
