In this study, the pattern of formation and morphology of the juvenile skeletons of three laboratory-reared pocilloporids, Seriatopora hystrix, Stylophora pistillata andPocillopora damicornis, were compared to determine whether they could be reliably distinguished. The pattern of skeleton formation, including the origin and structure of the septa, columella and corallite wall was similar in all species. Following the completion of the primary corallite wall after 4\u00b15 days, these species could be identified by differences in the diameter of the primary corallite. The mean diameter SE) of each species differed markedly: S. hystrix 400 2.7 \u03bcm, range 325\u00b1450 \u03bcm; S. pistillata 505 3.5 \u03bcm, range 400\u00b1550 \u03bcm; P. damicornis 697 7.5 \u03bcm, range 492\u00b1885 \u03bcm. Values for the primary corallite diameter overlapped in only 3% of samples, demonstrating the potential utility of this feature as a tool for classifying recruits obtained from the field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=498544499507817421", "cites_id": ["498544499507817421"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R-Babcock/publication/227285713_Morphological_differences_among_three_species_of_newly_settled_pocilloporid_coral_recruits/links/57eaedfc08ae91a0c8d3f34a/Morphological-differences-among-three-species-of-newly-settled-pocilloporid-coral-recruits.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zWvjtZQv6wYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
