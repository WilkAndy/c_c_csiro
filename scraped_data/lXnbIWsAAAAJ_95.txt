To resolve this, Australia has implemented the Integrated Marine Observing System\u2019s Animal Tracking Facility which comprises a continental-scale hydrophone array and coordinated data repository. This national acoustic network connects localized projects, enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple species over scales ranging from 100 s of meters to 1000 s of kilometers. There is a need to evaluate the utility of this national network in monitoring animal movement ecology, and to identify the spatial scales that the network effectively operates over. Cluster analyses assessed movements and residency of 2181 individuals from 92 species, and identified four functional movement classes apparent only through aggregating data across the entire national network. These functional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2919127004869313473", "cites_id": ["2919127004869313473"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-018-21988-5.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wUN8c4vSgigJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
