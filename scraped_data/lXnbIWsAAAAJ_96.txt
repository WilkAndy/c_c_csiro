At each site, measurements of algal and mobile macroinvertebrate species composition, algal community structure (biomass), grazer abundance and environmental variables were made. Clear patterns were evident in community structure and species composition across a gradient from sheltered coastal sites to exposed coastal and offshore sites. At all locations, large brown algae were found to be the dominant components of the reef communities. Ecklonia radiata and Carpophyllum maschalocarpum were the most dominant species and were found at all locations. Algal species richness was highest at offshore islands and the northern-most locations, and lowest at the most sheltered location (Long Bay). Mobile macroinvertebrate species richness was lowest at Long Bay, but was also low at offshore island locations. Large variation in algal community structure was found within and among locations that generally reflected the wave exposure and the coastal or offshore setting of sites. Patterns in algal community structure were significantly related to a number of environmental variables (eg wave exposure and turbidity) and also to the density of sea urchins Evechinus chloroticus. The abundance of sea urchins varied with depth, and from sheltered to exposed locations. At sheltered sites they were rare, but with increasing exposure they became more abundant and their upper grazing limit moved deeper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8683021262876933910", "cites_id": ["8683021262876933910"], "pub_url": "http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/science-and-technical/sfc245.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fn_xftVJgHgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 10, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
