Populations ofH. coerulea studied on the Great Barrier Reef between 1984 and 1989 were found to have separate sexes and an annual gametogenic cycle. Mature eggs were large (>800\u00b5m diam), and their development was initiated internally. There appeared to be a lunar or semi-lunar periodicity in reproductive behaviour, with brooding of larvae commencing around either full or new moon. Development proceeded via superficial cleavage and a solid stereoblastula. Subsequent development took place on the surface of the colony, within a temporary brood-space created by protracted distension of the polyps. Larvae lacked zooxanthellae and were brooded for between 6 and 14 d prior to leaving the colony \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11752397537530840024", "cites_id": ["11752397537530840024"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01314352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2IOzI0vnGKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
