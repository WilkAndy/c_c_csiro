Capturing the dynamics of seagrass communities requires both a detailed representation of processes such as seagrass nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, as well as models of light penetration, water column and sediment biogeochemical processes and other ecosystem characteristics that determine the environmental state. Here we develop a new two-state, 13-parameter seagrass model with the aim of providing sufficient detail to represent light and nutrient limitation, but simple enough to be coupled into a 60 state variable biogeochemical model. The novel formulation is built around a nitrogen-specific leaf area parameter, \u03a9, that is well-constrained and is used in calculating both the rate of photosynthesis and the fraction of the seafloor covered by seagrass, Aeff, where Aeff = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 \u03a9SGA) and SGA is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "lXnbIWsAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15128092035968889137", "cites_id": ["15128092035968889137"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380015005797", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MXFX_Y3H8dEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
