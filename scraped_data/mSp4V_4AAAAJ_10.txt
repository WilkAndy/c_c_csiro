This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the trade-offs in performance across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision-makers. At a technical level, the framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 526, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=854586616045614288", "cites_id": ["854586616045614288"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/56/6/967/658156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0LQz3_8Z3AsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 9, "2002": 9, "2003": 5, "2004": 11, "2005": 20, "2006": 17, "2007": 18, "2008": 24, "2009": 31, "2010": 26, "2011": 34, "2012": 31, "2013": 21, "2014": 32, "2015": 31, "2016": 56, "2017": 20, "2018": 28, "2019": 25, "2020": 23, "2021": 25, "2022": 18, "2023": 5}}
