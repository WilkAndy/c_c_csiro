Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, in partnership with the Division of Nursing in the School of Education, to restructure its fellowship program for undergraduate nursing students. Bringing together an interdisciplinary team with experience in leadership development, nursing and health policy, and health care administration, NYU designed and delivered an innovative and state-of-the-art leadership development program for the 1999 Fuld Fellowship program. The new program started in June 1999 with 21 nursing students from all over the country.
