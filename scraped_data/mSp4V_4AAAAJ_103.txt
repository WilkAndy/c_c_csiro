Estimating population density or size and survey detectability (i.e. gear efficiency in a fishery) for such elusive species is technically challenging. We extend abundance and detectability (N-mixture) methods to deal with this difficult situation, particularly for application to fish populations where gear efficiency is almost never equal to one. The method involves a mixture of statistical models (negative binomial, Poisson, and binomial functions) at two spatial scales: between-cell and within-cell. The innovation in this approach is to use more than one fishing gear with different efficiencies to simultaneously catch (sample) the same population in each cell at the same time-step. We carried out computer simulations on a range of scenarios and estimated the relevant parameters using a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4869894673105451189", "cites_id": ["4869894673105451189"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/71/9/2436/594507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tXgERGdXlUMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
