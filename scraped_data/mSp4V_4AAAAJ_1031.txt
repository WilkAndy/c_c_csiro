The theme for the conference was \u201cSpatial and Temporal Dynamics for Management of Natural Resource Systems\u201d. Eighty scientists from ten countries attended the conference. This special issue comprises five papers from the 45 presented at that meeting, including two of the three keynote papers (Landsberg and Coops, and McKelvey).The papers in this special issue reflect part of the diversity of papers presented at the Hobart meeting. These papers cover applications ranging from forestry to fisheries to management of grazing lands. Disciplinary focus covers both ecological and economic modeling. Methods include simulation modeling, analytical approaches, game theory and optimal control theory, including dynamic programming. All of the models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:rhSvDnGaX0QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1939-7445.1999.tb00018.x", "cites_per_year": {}}
