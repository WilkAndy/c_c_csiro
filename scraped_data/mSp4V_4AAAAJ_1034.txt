Step-scan Fourier transform spectroscopy permits spectral coverage from UV to mid IR with sub nanosecond resolution making it possible to track emission from multiple manifolds with full temporal resolution in a single experiment. Data for several rare-earth doped crystalline materials exhibiting multiple emission bands and including evidence of energy transfer is shown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:1QridOC0dsoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7068291717877372631&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:15bqNN6dF2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
