This honor stems neither from the originality of his ideas nor from the techniques of economic analysis that he pioneered. Rather, Smith is regarded as the father of economics due to his vision of capitalism as an economic system that makes everyone better off. Smith was the first person to see the benefits stemming from greater competition and to argue for policies that promote greater competition. This required both reduced government involvements in the economy, and also government actions to counter monopolistic tendencies and practices.Smith was born in 1723 in Kirkcaldy, a small town near Edinburgh, Scotland. His father, a lawyer and comptroller of customer duties, died shortly before he was born; so Smith was raised by his mother and by guardians appointed in his father's will (Ross 1995, p. 2)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YiXZnN5otT4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14766352351266268042&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
