At least some marine bryozoan skeletons precipitate carbonate in isotopic equilibrium with sea water. Skeletons from throughout New Zealand range from-2 to 3 per thousand 18)(ppt, PDB), and from-5 to 3 per thousand 13 C (ppt, PBD). Values of 18 O, in particular, show a good correlation to water temperature. There are unusual'bryozoan meadows' on the Otago mid-shelf (eastern South Island, New Zealand). Colonies of six major species are large (up to 35 cm high) and interweave to provide a substantial habitat for animals requiring either hard substrate or shelter. It is important in studies of benthic ecology, fisheries, carbonate sedimentology, and marine biodiversity to know the age of these colonies, but growth rate and age structure of bryozoans generally, and those of New Zealand species in particular, are not known. A muli-disciplinary study of this bryozoan skeletal carbonate is on-going at the University of Otago"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Fd3FjPIBfbkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:31050880", "cites_per_year": {}}
