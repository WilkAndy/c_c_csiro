Step \u2013 scan Fourier transform spectroscopy permits spectral coverage from UV to mid IR with sub nanosecond resolution making it possible to track emission from multiple manifolds with full temporal resolution in a single experiment. Data for several rare-earth doped crystalline materials exhibiting multiple emission bands and including evidence of energy transfer is shown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:8uzoZH4hB9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-online-proceedings-library-archive/article/high-resolution-time-and-frequency-resolved-spectroscopy-for-the-study-of-photophysical-processes-in-luminescent-materials/6A24D08B66D046ADE2B64A0F043FAF0B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jy_1HlDRxCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
