Statistically estimated, process\u2010based simulation models of two distinct fish populations are used to forecast the species population levels, and capture the risk of crossing a management defined trigger point. We show how to calculate the environmental derivative price, which is the amount a risk\u2010neutral investor would require for promising a pay\u2010out should the species abundance fall below the trigger level. The approach provides the potential for environmental derivatives to support species recovery, and a method for measuring the underlying \u201chealth\u201d of a managed population and calculating risk\u2010cost tradeoffs among alternative management strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9005337618478842677", "cites_id": ["9005337618478842677"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NcPkB9pi-XwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
