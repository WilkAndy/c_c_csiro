The diffusion mechanism of Ag ions have been studied in a Molecular Dynamics formalism. The authors have calculated the diffusion coefficient as function of temperature and concentration and have calculated the activation energy for diffusion from the Arrhenius plot of D{sub Ag} vs temperature. Results obtained for the end points Ag{sub 2}Se and Ag{sub 2}S agree with experimental measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:nWoA1JPTheMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/323474", "cites_per_year": {}}
