This work, based at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL), has been ongoing for more than 30 years. The success of the current program has created a pressure for capabilities which cannot be satisfied by the HCL. The promising results of the existing treatments have prompted a desire to initiate protocols at new sites. This calls for a facility which is modern, integrated with the hospital services, capable of satisfying regional needs and has the technical capacity to support more advanced treatment techniques. Such a new facility, the Northeast Proton Therapy Center, is under construction on the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) campus. This facility is funded by the Massachusetts General Hospital and the National Cancer Institute. The work described herein is the result of many contributors from within the project team including MGH, IBA, Bechtel, HCL and consultants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:l04XxKJJ8swC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SYRIDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA51&dq=info:NqMVeaXpiWQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=yH3dzVqflQ&sig=U-613hz_GySvsruKpYtKcQU7pVk", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NqMVeaXpiWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
