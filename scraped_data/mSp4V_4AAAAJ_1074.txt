The diffusion, ionic conductivity and ionic mobility of Ag ions have been studied in a Molecular Dynamics formalism. The correlated motion of the Ag ions in these solutions have been investigated by turning on and off the vibrations of the Se and S lattices. The variation of the mobility of the Ag ions is discussed in terms of the changes induced by the difference in lattice vibrations of the Se lattice as function of substitutional S in Ag_2Se and of the S lattice as function of substitutional Se in Ag_2S."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:inmFHauC9wsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998APS..MAR.K3843S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
