The values of the parameters of an age-and sex-structured population dynamics model are estimated using information on catches, catch rates, the fraction of winter fishery catches consisting of females, and the age-composition and length-frequency of catches. Estimated parameters include virgin biomass, recruitment steep-ness, annual recruitment anomalies, selectivity, and natural mortality. For the Bayesian assessment, priors were constructed as part of the stock assessment process by a working group involving fishermen, managers, and scientists. The working group also reviewed all data inputs, and de-termined base-case analyses and sensitivity tests. The latter included sen-sitivity to weightings on data, levels of historical catches, and the possibility of auto-correlated recruitment anomalies. The results of the Bayesian anal-yses are used as the basis for risk assessment and evaluation of future harvest strategies for the stock."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:WcIdZ7LIMYsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13609840368204377614&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Du6X9LTd37wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
