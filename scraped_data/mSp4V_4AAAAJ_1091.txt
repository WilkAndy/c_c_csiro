Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 1520 Angstroms) images of dwarf galaxy Holmberg II were taken with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) during the Astro-2 mission in March 1995 providing a direct image of the recently-formed, massive stars in the galaxy. Using the FUV data and corresponding optical observations in the U, B, and R bands, total magnitudes and colors for the galaxy are derived. We determine surface brightness profiles in the plane of the galaxy and find that the optical surface brightness profiles are normal in comparison to other dwarf galaxies showing a central light depression at radii close to the dynamical center. The FUV surface brightness profile exhibits a central depression and has two peaks in the surface brightness which are at higher levels than the central region. The FUV flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:gUOu-QWEMMQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AAS...191.8105S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
