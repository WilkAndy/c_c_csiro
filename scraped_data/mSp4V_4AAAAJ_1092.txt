These data sample a 34\" region centered on the nucleus. The continuum subtracted imagery for the F487N, F658N, and F502N filters show pronounced extended emission in H\u03b2, H\u03b1, and [O III] lambda 5007, respectively. The F457M continuum and [O III] imagery reveal strong scattering clouds in the photoionization cone extending to the northeast. The [O III] image also exhibits bright compact knots ionized by the continuum emission of the obscured nucleus to the southwest. The H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio reveals a 860 pc region of large extinction (E (BV)>= 12) about the nucleus. However, the bright scattering clouds within 250 pc of the nucleus, lying in the cone, display no significant reddening. The reddening insensitive [O III]/H\u03b2 flux ratio shows no apparent drop-off with distance toward the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KKiikWAUrRgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997AAS...191.7805M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
