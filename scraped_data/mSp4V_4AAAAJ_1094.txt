Differential cross sections are determined in the center-of-mass energy range 2.911{lt}{radical}(s){lt}3.686 GeV for the final states {pi}{sup 0}{pi}{sup 0}, {eta}{pi}{sup 0}, {eta}{eta}, {pi}{sup 0}{gamma}, and {gamma}{gamma}. The energy dependence of differential cross sections at 90{degree} in the center of mass is studied to test the predictions of phenomenological QCD scaling hypotheses which predict power-law dependence. {copyright} {ital 1997} {ital The American Physical Society}"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:08LKyc9QYe8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538689", "cites_per_year": {}}
