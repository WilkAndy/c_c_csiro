We carried out Molecular Dynamics calculations to study the dynamical correlations among these compounds to determine the diffusion coefficient, activation energy, and ionic conductivity of silver ions as function of temperature and Se concentration. We present results of these calculations and discuss their relation in terms of transport mechanisms of the Ag ions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997APS..MAR.O2705S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
