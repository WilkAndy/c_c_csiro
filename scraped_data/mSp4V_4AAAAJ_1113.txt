I have evaluated the free energy, entropy and the corresponding contributions from individual compositional types to these quantities, employing the method of adiabatic switching in a MD framework. I find that the Ag atoms have the larger contribution (per mole) in both structures: 75% in Ag2S and 65% in Ag2Se (at 300K). The Ag contribution decreases with temperature in both materials, while the Se and S contributions to the entropy increase. The Ag in Ag2S has a larger entropy than in Ag2Se. Volumetric changes play a significant role in the entropy differences in these systems. I find that at temperatures above 400K, a relatively larger volumetric change occurs in Ag2Se than in Ag2S. I calculated the phonon density of states (DOS) of these two systems and find tha. t Ag has the same cut-off frequency in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:awHEhYZT47wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/ebc7d15a065bc6b806027ce587904584/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:za_i04Z32CkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
