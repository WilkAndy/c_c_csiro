The clinical study performed by the Canadian Bone Marrow Transplant Group (CMBTG) testing resulted in a decreased rate of severe acute graft-versus-host disease and a more favorable response of patients that developed CMV disease in spite of the prophylaxis was observed for patients in the CMV immunoglobulin (CMV-Ig)-treated group. Acyclovir and CMV-Ig did not result in a significant survival advantage of the group treated with the combined strategy over the group receiving acyclovir alone. Preemptive therapy with ganciclovir holds promise to represent a successful and cost-effective strategy to prevent development of CMV disease in patients at risk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:XGCB9NUBGnMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-60377-8_149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d5RgTqv2wKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
