The changes in ice thickness above and below these reflections have been used in a steady state model to calculate the basal mass flux of the ice shelf soon after the ice begins to float.  The calculated melt rates range between 0 and 7 m yr     -     1     with an estimated standard error of \u00b12.4 m yr     -     1     , in reasonable agreement with earlier estimates based on surface glaciological observations.  Additional seismic data would reduce the limitations in the method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ZJWHNt7Cjk4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-f8155c98-9181-3db6-8a98-a07c4de99692", "cites_per_year": {}}
