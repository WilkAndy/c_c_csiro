The diffusion mechanism of Ag ions have been studied in a Molecular Dynamics formalism. We have calculated the diffusion coefficient as function of temperature and concentration and have calculated the activation energy for diffusion from the Arrhenius plot of D Ag vs temperature. Results obtained for the end points Ag2Se and Ag2S agree with experimental measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Vztgr1qGG8IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-online-proceedings-library-archive/article/mobility-of-ag-atoms-in-the-binary-system-ag2seag2s-a-molecular-dynamics-study/DE86CD05F97D2CDAED3E0F0F3A906526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qpct3Z2EBrAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
