Patients with (a) previously untreated B-CLL of Binet stages B or C, or (b) relapsed BCLL pretreated with non-anthracycline-containing regimens for more than 6 months but less than 3 years were randomly assigned to either fludarabine given at a dose of 25 mg/m2 per day over 5 consecutive days or CAP comprising cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 per day and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 and prednisone 40 mg/m2 per day on days 1-5. Both regimens were repeated every 28 days for a total of six courses.A total of 196 patients were entered into the trial of whom 100 were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:zwpXiJ37cpgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-60377-8_57", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tzAG5ghqikYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
