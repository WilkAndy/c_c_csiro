They have employed the methods of adiabatic switching and temperature integration over a reversible path to obtain the phase diagram. They discuss the nature of the entropy difference in terms of ion mobility and previous MD calculations of diffusion rates in these systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Nw_I7GeUguwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/479313", "cites_per_year": {}}
