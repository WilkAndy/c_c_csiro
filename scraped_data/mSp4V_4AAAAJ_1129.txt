Diverse commercial and recreational fisheries are widespread, and constitute multimillion dollar industries in the region. Biological information about species targeted by fishing is necessary but not sufficient to successfully manage the fisheries and ecosystem. Controlled experimental manipulations of fishing pressure and management options have been recommended previously as the most effective mechanisms for assessing empirically the responses of targeted stocks, other reef organisms, and fishing practice to changes in fishing pressure. Such information is not currently available for the Great Barrier Reef reef line fisheries, but will be critical to future decisions about management of Great Barrier Reef recreational and commercial fisheries. We used computer simulations to model the population dynamics of the of the main target \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/ocrd/283082.pdf#page=193", "cites_per_year": {}}
