The sample includes large disk systems, irregular, dwarf, and blue compact galaxies. These images have a spatial resolution of~ 3arcsec and a limiting surface brightness, mu_ {1500}~ 24.5 mags arcsec (-1). The objects span an observed FUV luminosity range from-17 to-22 mags. We derive global star formation rates by comparing the observed FUV fluxes to the predictions of stellar population models. The UV-derived astration rates are compared to those derived from H\u03b1 and thermal infrared fluxes to explore the utility of star formation rates estimated from FUV data, and the star formation histories of these systems. The ratio of FIR to FUV astration rates is a measure of the``buried''massive star component.
