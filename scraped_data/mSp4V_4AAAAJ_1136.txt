We report progress in making very lightweight replica mirrors and structures using space qualified composite materials. We have been able to solve the major problems of fiber print-through and proper mold release without figure distortion. Very high surface smoothness (< 10 Angstroms rms) have been achieved, mirrors of moderate size (0.4 m Ritchey-Chretien) have been produced, and ion milling tests have been performed. We are currently developing the technique to make larger (> 1 m) mirrors at very low cost. In addition, radiation tolerant detectors are needed that can survive the harsh lunar environment and produce useful science data. Flight qualified high speed charge-injection detector and electronics systems have been developed. We report on radiation trials and tests to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:8NHCvSvNRCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996AAS...188.5513O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
