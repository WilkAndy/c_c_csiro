We have calculated free energies and vibrational entropies in this system as a function of temperature and concentration employing adiabatic switching in a Molecular Dynamics framework. We present results of these calculations and dynamic information on ion mobility about the transition temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:q1zXlPLtbUIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996APS..MAR.E2711S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
