We used a simple multispecies predation model to explore the effect of alternative fishing strategies on a 3\u2011trophic-level food chain. Fishing strategies included highly selective fishing, nonselective fishing, and balanced harvesting that harvests all species at an instantaneous fishing mortality rate either proportional to intrinsic population growth rate or proportional to current population growth rate. The results showed that harvesting species at higher trophic levels has a low impact on total biomass but results in very low yields and severe impacts on trophic structure. Selectively harvesting species at the bottom of the food chain reduces the biomass of all fish, results in high yields, and is the only strategy that maintains unfished trophic structure.
