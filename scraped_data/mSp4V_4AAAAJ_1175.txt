We performed a search for the process {ital {bar p}p}{r_arrow}{eta}{sub {ital c}}{sup {prime}}(2 {sup 1}{ital S}{sub 0}){r_arrow}{gamma}{gamma} over a limited range of center-of-mass energies. Since no signal was observed, we derived upper limits on the product of branching ratios {ital B}({eta}{sub {ital c}}{sup {prime}}{r_arrow}{ital {bar p}p}){times}{ital B}({eta}{sub {ital c}}{sup {prime}}{r_arrow}{gamma}{gamma}) in the center-of-mass energy range 3584{le} {radical}{ital s} {le}3624 MeV.
