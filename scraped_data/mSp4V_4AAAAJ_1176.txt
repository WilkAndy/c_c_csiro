However, exact knowledge of pharmacodynarrdcs is essentially for the optimization of therapeutic regimens and maximal clinical efficacy especially in fluctuating patients. Methods: An oral single dose challenge using 100 mg levodopa 25 mg benserazide was performed under standardized conditions in 10 parkinsonian patients with clear-cut wearing-off fluctuations. A continuous sc infusion of apomorphine in a clinical subthreshold dosage was coadmimstered to the levodopa challenge under double blind conditions vs. NaC1 in each patient. Levodopa serum-concentrations (LSC) and the actual motor disability (AMD) as the efficacy parameter were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:kFSvnP10ePEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01281162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OJJdiZdagDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
