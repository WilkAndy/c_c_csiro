A retrospective analysis of historical assessments for fish stocks off southeast Australia is conducted to quantify the extent of uncertainty associated with estimates of spawning stock biomass in absolute terms and when expressed relative to spawning stock biomass over a sequence of reference years. This approach to quantifying uncertainty captures more sources of uncertainty than alternative approaches, such as the estimate of the variance of terminal year spawning stock biomass from asymptotic methods, the extent to which estimates of spawning stock biomass vary among the sensitivity tests that form part of most assessments, and conventional retrospective analyses. By all measures, estimates of spawning stock biomass in absolute terms are much less certain than estimates of relative stock \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YXPZ0dOdYS4C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=895314275575078781", "cites_id": ["895314275575078781"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783617302758", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fR_9DZfLbAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
