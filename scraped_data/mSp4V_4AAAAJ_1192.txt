Analyses of neuropsychological test results revealed statistically significant differences, as well as similarities, between 25 patients with documented neurological and/or hepatic symptoms (symptomatic) and 9 patients with confirmed WD but without neurologic or hepatic findings (asymptomatic).  The 25 symptomatics revealed frequent and severe manual motor deficits and infrequent cognitive and memory deficits.  Statistically significant differences between the two groups appeared for the Purdue Pegboard Test of Manual Dexterity, Digit Symbol subtest of the WAIS-R, Wechsler Memory Scale-Delayed Figural Recall, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test.  Somato-sensory tests were normal in all, and differences as a function of gender, education, or urinary copper concentrations were nonsignificant.  One of the most intriguing findings was the absence of a significant correlation between the level of copper toxicity and the degree, nature, and frequency of associated neurological deficits. Contrary to previous assumptions about the direct influence of copper toxicity on cognitive and motor functions in WD, this finding suggests alternative etiologies for selective cognitive and motor deficits in WD. Review of medical records revealed that 50% of this entire sample received psychiatric treatment, including hospitalization for psychoses, depression, anxiety, and related disorders prior to the diagnosis of WD.
