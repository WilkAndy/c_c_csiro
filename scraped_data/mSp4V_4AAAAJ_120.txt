While there are nine combinations in which the three possible protonation states of the two histidines (with protons on N\u03b4 (HID), N\u03b5 (HIE), or both N\u03b4 and N\u03b5 (HIP)) can be paired, there is presently no consensus as to which of these states is present, let alone mechanistically relevant. EPR hyperfine couplings for selected protons of the FADH\u2022 radical have previously been used to address this issue. Our QM/MM calculations show, however, that the experimental couplings are equally well reproduced by each of the nine combinations. Since the EPR results seemingly cannot be used to unequivocally assign the protonation states, the pKa values of the two histidines were calculated using the popular PROPKA, H++, and APBS approaches, in various \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:qyG9-fBpYwcC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2654009158430655485", "cites_id": ["2654009158430655485"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct2005648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_YPknkTv1CQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
