Neutral and attentionally significant tones were used to determine reactivity of the skin conductance response (SCR) and the finger pulse amplitude response (FPAR) systems.  Thirty-five schizophrenic and 24 manic patients were compared to 29 normals weekly for 4 weeks.  In the first and last sessions, subjects were presented with a series of innocuous tones followed by an attentional task requiring a foot pedal response to tones of a given pitch.  No stimuli were given during the second and third sessions.  For FPAR, the schizophrenic and manic patients had significantly lower response frequencies to the attentional task than the control sample during both testing sessions (Kruskal-Wallis H \u2265 9.9; p \u2264 0.007), but patient groups were similar to each other.  FPAR frequency to task significant stimuli were highly correlated across sessions (Spearman rho = 0.7; p = 0.0001).  There were no between-group differences in SCR frequency to the attentional task or in SCR or FPAR frequency to the neutral tones.  Responsivity to task relevant tones was always significantly greater than to neutral tones in both SCR and FPAR (Wilcoxon Z \u2265 5.2; p = 0.0001).  Autonomic reactivity appears reduced in schizophrenic and manic patients when compared to controls, but there do not appear to be differences between patient groups.  This relationship is temporally stable but only evident in FPAR when task-relevant tones are being used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-4ba7c3ae-4528-31d5-a84d-c30517684f1a", "cites_per_year": {}}
