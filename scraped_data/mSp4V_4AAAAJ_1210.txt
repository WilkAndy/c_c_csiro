We maintain flexibility through the development phase by adopting an exceptionally modular design. Such an approach allows for increasing the scope and capability of the camera, as well as planning for some descope potential as a form of development contingency. Deployment is currently planned for the 1999 HST Servicing Mission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:VDARjI3xf8gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AAS...185.0914C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
