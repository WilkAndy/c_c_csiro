The present study was undertaken to replicate and extend our prior fmdings that schizophrenic patients demonstrate superior semantic memory compared to left temporal epileptics (LTLE) but worse attentional performance than patients with either left or right TLE using new subject samples and additional language measures. Method: We examined the presurgery WAlS-R data from 33 LTLE, 45 RTLE patients and 48 patients with a DSM-lii diagnosis of schizophrenia. We examined the Multilingual Aphasia Exam in different patient samples composed of 24 DSM-lll-R schizophrenics, 48'LTLE, and 53 RTLE patients. TLE pa. tients received comprehensive EEG and neuroimaging studies to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3711653823013843792&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
