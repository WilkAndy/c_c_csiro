In this report, we assess the effects of medication on early symptoms in the adolescents and compare these treatment effects with those of chronic adult schizophrenics. Fourteen adolescent patients (mean age 15) were rated on an adolescent version (A-PANSS) of the adult PANSS, a state measure divided into three scales: positive syndrome, negative syndrome and general psychopathology. Adolescent ratings were conducted first within a week of admission when medication free and a second time, approximately four weeks later, when stabilized on neuroleptics. Adolescents were compared with 20 multi-episode adult psychotics (mean age 30), who were rated~, fter a four week drug washout and again after a four week chug stabilization period. No differences in clinical profiles were found \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7091360994847441838&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
