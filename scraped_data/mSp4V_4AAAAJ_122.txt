Arguably, however, this remains an area where policy-making has run ahead of science. A growing number of studies identify limitations of offsets in achieving ecologically sustainable outcomes, pointing to ethical and implementation issues that may undermine their effectiveness. We develop a novel system dynamic modelling framework to analyze the no net loss objective of development and biodiversity offsets. The modelling framework considers a marine-based example, where resource abundance depends on a habitat that is affected by a sequence of development projects, and biodiversity offsets are understood as habitat restoration actions. The model is used to explore the implications of four alternative offset management strategies for a regulator, which differ in how net loss is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17131084755979349611", "cites_id": ["17131084755979349611"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380015001738", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ay5COdLWve0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
