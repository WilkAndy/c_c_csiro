There is a small naval base located on the shore of the bay. In the late 1980s Jervis Bay was chosen as a potential site for a proposed major naval base relocation. In this context, the Department of Defence commissioned a major environmental baseline study of the bay as a component of an Environmental Impact Assessment. CSIRO directed the base-line study which ran over three years and in-volved a number of research agencies. During the course of the study a decision was made against relocation of the naval base to Jervis Bay and the context of the study changed somewhat. A more detailed history and description of the Jervis Bay baseline study may be found in Ward and Jacoby (1992)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9TKaBlIwHecC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15281860712546345303&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V6FS7lkTFNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
