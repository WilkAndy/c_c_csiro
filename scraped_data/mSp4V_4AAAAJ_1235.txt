Charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the detectors of choice for ground-based applications, fall short in this respect because of their high susceptibility to radiation induced bulk traps and loss of charge transfer efficiency (CTE). Blooming in CCDs also limits the dynamic range and degrades resolution, while the well known red leak problem hinders observiations in the ultraviolet. We describe an ongoing program at NASA GSFC to develop intensified random-access Charge-Injection Devices (CIDs), a new generation of space uv detectors which do not have the shortcomings of CCDs. CIDs, like CCDs, are silicon array detectors. Unlike CCDs, however, CIDs have more than 100x greater tolerance to ionizing particle radiation. Since CIDs do not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:GzlcqhCAosUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993AAS...183.1003P", "cites_per_year": {}}
