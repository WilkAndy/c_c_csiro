But in his monumental History of Economic Analysis he praises \u2018the rudimentary equilibrium theory of chapter 7, by far the best piece of economic theory turned out by A. Smith\u2019(1954: 189), simply because it was a theoretical predecessor of Walras. While Isnard, Smith, Say and Ricardo \u2018struggled or rather fumbled for it\u2019, for Schumpeter it was Walras who made the \u2018discovery\u2019of economic equilibrium,\u2018the Magna Carta of economic theory\u2019(ibid.: 242). Since then, it has been generally accepted that Smith was a forerunner, if not the founder, of general economic equilibrium theory. 1 While some consider Walras\u2019s general economic equilibrium to be \u2018the peak of neoclassical economics\u2019(Samuelson 1952: 61), nevertheless Adam Smith is widely seen as the \u2018father of our science\u2019. Moreover, the most famous (and most elusive) metaphor in the history of economic thought, the invisible hand, has been interpreted as \u2018a poetic expression\u2019that confirms Smith as \u2018a creator of general equilibrium theory\u2019(Arrow and Hahn 1971: 2). One way or another, microeconomics textbooks too readily link Smith\u2019s invisible hand with some sort of equilibrium. 2 Although the interpretation of Smith as the father of general equilibrium theory has already been challenged, this chapter contributes to this debate by interpreting Smith as a real Newtonian. Within this particular debate an intellectual appreciation of the eighteenth-century context, which was thoroughly pervaded by Newton\u2019s enormous influence, has led to an assessment of Newton\u2019s influence on Adam Smith.
