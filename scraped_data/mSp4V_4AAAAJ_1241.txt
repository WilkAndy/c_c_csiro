One source of this reversal of political fortunes is a new survey which has been interpreted by some as saying that 1 per cent of American men are gay rather than the 10 per cent figure that has crept into popular consciousness. Both figures are probably wrong, but it will be a long time before there is any agreement on the correct figure, if any such agreement is possible."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/ielapa.026053024234695", "cites_per_year": {}}
