Various recent studies have shown that the public face of science is intimately related to its cognitive and methodological content. Jan Golinski has taken the chemistry and, in what amounts to a series of case studies, uses it to demonstrate this point. Stylish, well-written and thoroughly on top of the secondary literature, this fine study should appeal to most scholars as well as being accessible to students. Golinski begins with Cullen and the philosopher-chemists of the Scottish Enlightenment and explores the presentation of chemistry to students and literati in the university lecture theatre and the club. It is a shame that a first chapter on Boyle was not included.(He is frequently referred to and his chemistry would have evidenced yet another contrasting style).
