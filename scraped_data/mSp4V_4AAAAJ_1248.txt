These charmonium states are formed exclusively in [ital [bar p]p] annihilations at the Fermilab Antiproton Accumulator ring, where stochastically cooled antiprotons are brought into collision with the protons of an in- ternal hydrogen gas jet target. The antiproton energy is precisely controlled and measured allowing an accurate measurement of the resonance parameters. From the shape of the excitation curves we find that the widths of [ital J]/[psi] and [psi][prime] are [Gamma]([ital J]/[psi])=99[plus minus]12[plus minus]6 keV and [Gamma]([psi][prime])=306[plus minus]36[plus minus]16 keV, and that the mass of the [ital J]/[psi] is 3096.87[plus minus]0.03[plus minus]0.03 MeV/[ital c][sup 2]. For the [ital J]/[psi] we obtain [ital B]([ital J]/[psi][r arrow][ital [bar p]p])[ital B]([ital J]/[psi][r arrow][ital e][sup +][ital e[minus]]) =(1.14[sup +0.16][sub [minus]0.12][plus minus]0.10)[times]10[sup [minus]4]; for the [psi][prime] we obtain [ital B]([psi][prime][r arrow][ital [bar p]p])[[ital B]([psi][prime][r arrow][ital e][sup +][ital e[minus]]) +[ital B]([psi][prime][r arrow][ital J]/[psi][ital X])[ital B]([ital J]/[psi][r arrow][ital e][sup +][ital e[minus]])] =(1.17[sub [minus]0.12][sup +0.14][plus minus]0.08)[times]10[sup [minus]5]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:C62MIdXOJf4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7177827", "cites_per_year": {}}
