While the crash rate per 1,000 drivers did not change following GDL, a significant decline in the percentage of 16-year-olds with a driver's license corresponded with large decreases in population-based crash and injury rates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ADirrNDYtLIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7074497781060218156", "cites_id": ["7074497781060218156"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/12214363", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LC1i5D-qLWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
