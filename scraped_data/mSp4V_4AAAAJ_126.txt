This pioneering policy attempted to set a framework for integrated and ecosystem-based planning and management for all of Australia\u2019s marine jurisdictions but lacked input and therefore buy-in from state and territory jurisdictions. Under the umbrella of Oceans Policy sat Australia\u2019s Marine Science and Technology Plan (MSTP)(Environment Australia 1999)\u2013addressing existing and emerging priorities for marine science, technology and engineering.
