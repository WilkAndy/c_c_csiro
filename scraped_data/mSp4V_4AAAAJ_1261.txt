Refractory Raw Materials and High Performance Refractory Products Beijing", "volume": "30", "abstract": "Recent developments in the ceramic and refractory industries are reviewed and related to the need for better, more efficient firing processes. The requirement has led to improvement in kiln design and control, as well as to use of controlled atmospheres. Kiln design and technology have developed to meet the requirements of the ceramic and refractory manufacturers for improving performance and efficiency, including faster firing schedules. These improvements are not only related to energy savings, but also as part of the quality control techniques."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3DN2I6VP0lQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13633856237387056005&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
