A 20-year-old man presented with bilateral tonsillar enlargement and lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Full blood count was: hemoglobin 88 g/L, white blood cell count 57 x 109/L, platelets 69 x 109/L. The bone marrow was hypercellular with 93% blasts, some with coarse granules but no Auer rods. Sudan Black was faintly positive in 3% of the blasts. A working diagnosis of AML (French-American-British [FABI-M1) was made and the patient was randomized in the DAT 3+ 10 arm of the Medical Research Council (MRC) AMLlO trial protocol.
