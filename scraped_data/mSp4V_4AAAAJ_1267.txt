Individually these syndromes are rare, but collectively they accounted for 10% of cytogenetic referrals in post-natal cases to the Children\u2019s Hospital, Sydney, over the last 12 months. The commonest are the Prader-Willi and Angelman\u2019s Syndrome (\u0394), in which the deletions are in the proximal long arm of chromosome 15. Others include Miller Diecker, Alagille, Smith Magenis, Langer Gedion \u0394, Wilms tumour and Retinoblastoma, each with deletions at different loci.To produce HRB of metaphase chromosomes the following is required:- a) a block to the mitotic cycle is introduced at a known point in time before S phase; b) the block is released and the cell cycle is allowed to progress; c) a decondensing agent is added prior to metaphase arrest; and d) metaphase arrest is short. Banding is subsequently applied by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:A5mcrx2i-EUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031302516359797", "cites_per_year": {}}
