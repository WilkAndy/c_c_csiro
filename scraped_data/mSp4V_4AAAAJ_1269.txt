Recent neuropathological and epidemiological studies have implicated the second prenatal trimester of fetal life. The distal upper limb also develops during this period and subtle structural abnormalities of the palms and fingers may reflect deleterious intrauterine experience.Using an inkless method, we took finger and palm prints from 45 ICD-9 schizophrenics attending our services and 43 healthy controls. Laterality was assessed and chart reviews for clinical correlates were carried out by an independent researcher. The prints were examined \u2018blindly\u2019by four raters and 7 sets of prints were judged by all four raters to have markedly increased, net-like secondary creases over the fingers and entire palmar area.
