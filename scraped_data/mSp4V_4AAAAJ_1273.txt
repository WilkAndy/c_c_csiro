O'Connell, TJ McKerma, SK Cunningharn. Department of Endocrinology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin. While ACTH is the major regulator of cortisol production, the specific regulation of adrenal androgen production remains unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of prolactin (Prl), human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), B-lipoprotein (g-LPH) and Joining Peptide (JP) on adrenal steroidgenesis using a coilagenase-dispersed guinea-pig adrenal cell system. Adrenal cells were incubated for two hours in the presence and absence of varying amounts of hormones. Steroid production (pmol/10 s cells, mean+ SE) was determined by specific radioimmunoassay of cortisol, androstenedione (A4) and dehydroepiandro s tenedione (DHEA).
