The detector design relies on a grown pn junction for the diode and avoids producing exposed InGaAs junctions, which are difficult to passivate. The array fabrication procedure is fully compatible with future monolithic integration with InP-based electronics. A satisfactory yield of good arrays has been obtained. Optical crosstalk measurements were performed at DC and RF with the array mounted in a grating demultiplexer.< >"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:TewouNez5YAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/147408/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3e5TpwN7dQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
