Ten out of 12 grass pollens examined ware found to possess components which shared the antigenic and allergenic sites with rKBG60. However, differential binding to the components of various pollens with the antibodies produced to rKBG60 suggested that epitopes of this allergen were distributed differently among the grass pollens and that crossreactive allergens may share some but not all the epitopes. Three peptides of rKBG60 with relative amino acid sequence positions of l-188, 122-188 and 122-303 were generated with rDNA techniques and examined for their ability to bind with IgE antibodies of sera of 11 grass pollen allergic individuals. Whereas the sera of all the above individuals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:SxCCDk4iOpsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7829948607290832304&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
