No significant differences were observed for renal blood flow in either kidney between (or within) infected and control groups. Our data suggest that kidney function is not compromised in this animal model of encephalitis. The results are discussed in the context of the development of a non-invasive protocol for the in vivo diagnosis of herpes encephalitis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Dq_Ke-OEjMgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02841859009173090", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8oOhsXSrJRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
