The programs have been embedded within a menu system to make them more accessible to inexperienced users, and modified for inverse geometry spectrometers. A number of additional routines have been written in order to aid users with the preparation of control data.A program for fitting inelastic data, ELF, is also available. The data is fitted using a convolution of either a number of Lorentzians or a number of Gaussians."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ZUxERvGTmvgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9684143846726836740&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
