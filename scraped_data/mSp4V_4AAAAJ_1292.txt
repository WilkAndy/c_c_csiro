His research career began in Oxford where he was a demonstrator in biochemistry (1938-47). In Sir Rudolph Peters\u2019 laboratory with Drs Sinclair and Stocken, Professor Thompson worked on an antidote to the chemical warfare agent Lewisite. This arsenical was shown to inhibit the pyruvate oxidase system by combining the two thiol groups rather than a single SH group and this led in 1941 to the discovery by Stocken and Thompson of 2: 3 dimercaptopropanol as an antidote to Lewisite (Thompson, 1948).In 1947, when appointed to the Chair of Chemical Pathology at Guy\u2019s Hospital Medical School, he started what was to become a lifetime interest in the biochemistry of neurological diseases, especially multiple sclerosis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:BQCiT8P4igIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article-abstract/17/2/269/60021", "cites_per_year": {}}
