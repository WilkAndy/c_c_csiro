This relationship can be described by species\u2013area relationships. We explored the application of species\u2013area relationships to data sets of bottom trawl surveys to determine their ability to capture fishing\u2010induced changes in demersal fish communities.Australia.We performed numerical simulations to investigate whether species\u2013area relationship was sensitive to changes in community properties, such as richness, species abundances and spatial distribution. Then, we analysed a data set of bottom trawl surveys carried out in south\u2010east Australia spanning 20 years. These data provided information on demersal fish communities at different stages of fishing exploitation.
