Computer storage of data on farming systems, crop rotation. fertiliser usage, grid reference, soil type and climate, along with soil analytical data. would allow the factors influencing the fertility of such an important national resource as the soil to be identified. A better record of temporal trends in soil nutrient status and fertiliser inputs would be obtained for different agricultural practices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:0tRseZjC4qsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/1988/ap/ap9882500115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HEd9WtE0BqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
