Atypical neuroleptics are believed to have better clinical efficacy and fewer extrapyramidal side effects than classical antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate therapeutic effects and extrapyramidal side effects including akathisia in patients receiving long-term fluphenazine or clozapine therapy. All of them had fulfilled the DSM-IIIR diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and paranoid disorders, and all of them were frequently hospitalized. Twenty-eight patients (m= 13, f= 15), 14 in each group, were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 42 years (SD= 12), the mean duration of illness was 13 years (SD= 8). Patients in the first group had received fluphenazine for a period from 1 to 21 years (mean= 4.7, SD= 6.7). Their daily oral dose ranged from 1 to 40 mg during the study \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Gj5A9OHlevYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1609206295625540142", "cites_id": ["1609206295625540142"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1609206295625540142&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LiIVlZkMVRYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 5, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2}}
