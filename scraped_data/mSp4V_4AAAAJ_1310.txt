The tiltmeters detected flexing of the ice shelf close to the grounding line, due to tidal forces. In earlier studies on Rutford Ice Stream, flow was from grounded ice into the floating ice shelf. In contrast, the area studied on Ronne Ice Shelf exhibits flow from the ice shelf on to grounded ice rumples.The data span 5 km of the up-stream ice shelf and much of the grounded ice. Approximately 30 d of continuous tilt data are available for one site on the ice shelf. Analysis of this record can determine the dominant tidal frequencies present.A number of shorter records cover periods normally of a few days. These were obtained from sites both up-stream and down-stream of the long-term site. They have been used to investigate the variation in tilt amplitude with distance from the grounding line.The approximate position of the grounding line was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9wUeeRLfbNYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/tiltmeter-observations-from-doake-ice-rumples-ronne-ice-shelf-antarctica-abstract/8AC537B1FA3E84AB50DEA954623D4D47", "cites_per_year": {}}
