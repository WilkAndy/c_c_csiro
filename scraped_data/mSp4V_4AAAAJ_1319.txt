In this paper a general method for analysis of the properties of such systems is discussed and simple computer-based routines implementing this method are described. All code presented is written in MICROSOFT FORTRAN 80. The routines are readily transferable between differing micro- and mini-computers, with minimal alteration of code for compatibility with FORTRAN 77."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KxT4QD0sKr4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0266983887900074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u9vtaVc6y3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
