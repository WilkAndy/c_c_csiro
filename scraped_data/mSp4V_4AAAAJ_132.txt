It appears, however, that many of these extreme palaeofloods probably occurred under a different climatic regime from that currently operating and therefore it is unlikely that such floods will recur in the near future. It is also suggested that palaeoflood data, especially those on the Orange River, can be used (in conjunction with other sources) to contribute to the post-Wisconsin Glaciation palaeoclimatic reconstruction of southern Africa."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:xS75I-D7UoUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17863391437131922715", "cites_id": ["17863391437131922715"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17863391437131922715&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G70AJt6D5_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
