However, it is not always beneficial to aim for high pH values at a tip site. Results obtained to date have shown that there may be advantages in mixing some wastes to achieve a specific pH value, at which level the leaching of certain metals may be reduced. When considering the potential hazards of tipping a particular waste, leaching tests should be conducted in two stages. First, the leachability of metals should be determined as a function of pH, followed by sequential leachant replacement tests. Interpretation of the results must be carried out, bearing in mind the tip location, the underlying geology, local watercourses, prevailing weather conditions and other factors.
