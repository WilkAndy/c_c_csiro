Such mixtures often show chemical and radiochemical variations between preparations, and sub-optimal sensitivity in RIA. Regulatory peptides are often present in body tissues and fluids at very low concentrations and in different forms, such that very sensitive and specific assays are needed. These assays can be improved by the use of defined tracers, the use of which is now described for a range of iodinated peptides purified by RP-HPLC. These include human \u03b1-ANP\u00ae, insulin, VIP, glucagon, \u00df-endorphin, neurotensin, GRF, ACTE and IGF-1. RP-HPLC can produce carrier-free labelled peptides which are mono \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9jvjDF91bz4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-1892-8_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:na60RJ0yIqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
