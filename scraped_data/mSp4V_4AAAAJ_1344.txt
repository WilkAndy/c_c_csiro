GA is a quaternary atropine derivative which produces bronchodilation in normals (Am Rev Respir Dis 129: 871, 1984). Because the highly polar ammonium GA compound is poorly absorbed across mucosal surfaces, systemic manifestations of cholinergic blockade are unlikely. In 20 asthmatics, we evaluated bronchodilation with metered-dose GA aerosol to ascertain its onset and duration of action along with safety. In this randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, single-dose crossover trial, the asthma patients' bronchodilation was evaluated on 5 separate occasions to either placebo or a GA aerosol dose of 80, 240, 480 or 960 mcg. The patient's baseline spirometry (PFTs) for each visit was similar (mean FEVl+ SD of 62.2213. 6,\u20187. predicted) with values ranging from 30 to 80% predicted. After aerosol dosing, PFTs were measured at 30 min and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:vxVQT5kDUaMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9404882530881381749&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
