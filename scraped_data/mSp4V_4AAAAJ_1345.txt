Bush, W. Busse, Madison, WI Because THEO and aerosol SAL are frequently given together for asthma, it is important to-evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this combination. This is of particular interest with the availability of sustained-release, 24-hr THEO preparations. Our objective was (1) to compare single-daily vs daily-divided dosing with a 24-hr THEO (Uniphyl) and (2) to evaluate the added effect of aerosol SAL and Uniphyl. All 28 asthma patients evaluated in this doubleblind, placebo-control, randomized cross-over trial had therapeutic THEO blood levels on Uniphyl 800 mg pd. The patients were randomly treated with 4 regimens for one week each.
