Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience.We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:qm0DHzEu2WcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=296998639571622740", "cites_id": ["296998639571622740"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/145/7/2541/6585174", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VNtwarAmHwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
