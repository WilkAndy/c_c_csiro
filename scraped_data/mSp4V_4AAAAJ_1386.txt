These can operate through the practice of isolating infective individuals as soon as clinical symp-toms of the disease are diagnosed. It can be seen from Eqs.(5) and (7) that the size of R, is directly proportional to the term 17 (u+ y), which represents the average period of infectiousness of the disease in an individual. Reducing the effective length of this infective period can result in a substantial reduction in Ro and hence in the level of vaccination coverage required."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:yp_AGHFi12cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13055047857474002011&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W1x2ltvYLLUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
