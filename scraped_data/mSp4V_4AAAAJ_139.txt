Extrapolating survey results from shallow inshore areas to the continental shelf and slope is invalid, and the broader examination of Australian fisheries involves analytical deficiencies and factual errors. The analytical deficiency concerns the use of catch\u2010only methods to infer stock status. Extensive analysis has indicated that methods that use only catch data typically have much higher uncertainty than those based on model\u2010based estimation methods (Carruthers et al., 2014). Part of the reason is that catches are influenced by many factors other than abundance, including markets, changes in fisher behaviour and management arrangements. In Australia, for example, catches of one of Australia's most valuable finfish fisheries (blue grenadier) decreased by more than 50% from 2013 to 2016.
