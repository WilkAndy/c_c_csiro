Ulf yon Euler describes some of the work done in his laboratory since, together with Hillarp, he first presented evidence in 1956 that noradrenaline is stored in a subcellular particle in the splenic nerve trunk of the ox. This discovery followed the finding, three years earlier, independently in Hillarp's laboratory in Stockholm and Blaschko's in Oxford, that the catecholamines in the adrenal medulla were stored in\" granules\". The author explains that he has not attempted to compare and contrast the nerve granules with the adrenal granules. Thus, the book turns out to be a rather detailed account of experiments on noradrenaline-storing granules isolated from the splenic nerve and a few sympathetically innervated tissues. It will prove of particular value, therefore, to specialists in the field of neurotransmitter-containing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11727188150323956929&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
