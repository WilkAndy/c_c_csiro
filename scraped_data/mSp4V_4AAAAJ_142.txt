In this work, we considered the interactions of aspartate (Asp) derivatives, as models of complex biomolecules, with calcite. Using kinetic growth experiments, we investigated the inhibition of calcite growth by Asp, Asp2, and Asp3.This entailed the determination of a step-pinning growth regime as well as the evaluation of the adsorption constants and binding free energies for the three species to calcite crystals. These latter values are compared to free energy profiles obtained from fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. When a flat (104) calcite surface is used in the models, the measured trend of binding energies is poorly reproduced. However, a more realistic model comprised of a surface with an island containing edges and corners yields binding energies that compare very well with experiments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:XKD4hAGUp1wC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2748119133270472027", "cites_id": ["2748119133270472027"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.0c00061", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W3UKo8pHIyYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
