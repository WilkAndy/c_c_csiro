In US fisheries management, existing fishery ecosystem plans (FEPs) are primarily descriptive documents \u2014 not action-oriented planning processes. \u201cNext-generation\u201d FEPs extend existing FEPs by translating ecosystem principles into action through a structured process, including identifying and prioritizing objectives and evaluating trade-offs while assessing alternative management strategies for meeting objectives. We illustrate the potential for implementing a structured decision-making process for EBFM by reviewing fisheries management case studies through the lens of the next-generation FEP process, highlighting two perspectives. First, across case studies almost all steps occur, many occurring in multiple regions, indicating scientific and fisheries management capacity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:L2GVKwe9Y_8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10177581413366919263", "cites_id": ["10177581413366919263"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjfas-2019-0202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X3BaUF8IPo0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
