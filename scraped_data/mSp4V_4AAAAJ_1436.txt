Lorimer* and Henry M. Miziorko* abstract: Ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1. 1.39) from spinach leaves forms a stable complex of enzyme-activator C02-Mg-carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate. The C02 molecule of this complex does not readily exchange with free C02. The enzyme-activator 14C02-Mg-carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate complex was prepared free of unbound 14C02, and a vast molar excess of 12C02 was added. This mixture was added to a solution of diazomethane in methyl Cellosolve. The 14C ra-dioactivity became \u201cfixed\u201d to the enzyme with a yield of about 50%. The fixation of the activator C02 to the enzyme by diazomethane treatment occurred in a highly specific manner. The methylated enzyme-activator, 4C02 did not undergo ex-change with 12C02 andremained bound to enzyme denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The activator 14C02 was bound exclusively to the large catalytic subunit.
