Sections of the heart, 10 micron in thickness, stained with a modification of Masson's trichrome technique, and surrounded by at least 3 nerves fibres as a marker were projected by an ordinary photographic enlarger, and drawn on a polythene foam termoplastic material. The scale drawings were cut and put together to form a scale model of the heart studied in the peripulmonary tissue and between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The advantages and the limits of this technique are then discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:WhWj8MPdGPQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/7213461", "cites_per_year": {}}
