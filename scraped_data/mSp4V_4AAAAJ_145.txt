A dietary model, Consume, was recently developed to predict detailed dietary information for fishes on the basis of fish identity and size. This model was field-tested over a continental scale, predicting community-level consumption for other temperate marine fish communities that differed in species composition and size structure. Using local stomach contents data to field-test predictions, accurate performance of the model was found across 14 locations around southern Australia. Prey type and mean prey size were predicted for fishes at new locations with high accuracy (mean percentage overlap between predicted and actual prey types = 73%; r2 between predicted and observed mean prey size = 89%) when trained with stomach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=608364776593678186", "cites_id": ["608364776593678186"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098116300521", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:at-5gopYcQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
