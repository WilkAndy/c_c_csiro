Dynamic area closures, like rotational closures, have also been used as a management tool particularly for sessile organisms. In this study, bioeconomic models are developed to investigate dynamic closure strategies for use as a management tool in the harvest of a metapopulation consisting of two local sub\u2010populations. The models provide an optimal strategy that maximises the sum of discounted net returns with a fixed harvest level [i.e. total allowable catch (TAC)] by opening and closing the sub\u2010populations of a metapopulation, subject to random negative catastrophic effects. Results showed the optimal policy for opening and closing a single exploited population depends on the degree and pattern of migration between it and other sub\u2010populations.
