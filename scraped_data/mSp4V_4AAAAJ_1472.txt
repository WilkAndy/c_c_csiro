One study dealt with the long-term performance of plastic pipe and drew information from users' experience. The other study concerned accumulation of test data on fire spread in structures having plastic pipe in interior plumbing and DWV systems. Results of the two studies indicate that plastic pipe is very durable in long-term service as predicted by short-term tests and that while most plastic pipe will burn in established building fires, the fire spread potential is not great. Designs that further limit fire spread are given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:2adpFNImVzkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9951239739319892495&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
