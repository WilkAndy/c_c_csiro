In gathering his encyclopaedic information, Anthony Smith travelled 3000 miles and visited every major animal collection within Britain, 180 in all. Tabulated information is given for each: how to get there; opening hours; feeding arrangements for inmates and visitors; attractions and facilities. A descriptive story follows, mentioning the more noteworthy species and the breeding record, and there are numerous black and white illustrations and maps, and some striking colour photographs.The present reviewer feels a certain embarrassment at seeing animals in captivity. Not so the present author. His awareness that some collections have failed to keep up with rapidly changing standards, that traces of the old menagerie linger on and that gate money dominates, scarcely dampens his enthusiastic approval \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/natural-history-in-americafrom-mark-catesby-to-rachel-carson-by-hanleywayne-quadranglenew-york-times-book-co-895/32DD0308CDBB63F477604114F278DDFC", "cites_per_year": {}}
