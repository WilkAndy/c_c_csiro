The kinetics of H, LK-A, PGF-2a, and PGE-2 release were parallel, beginning within minutes and peaking at 20 to 30 min. PGF-ICY and PGE-2 were detected slightly earlier than H and LK-A. The maximal production of PGF-2a (86 to lQ4 ng/gm wet weight) in the medium was about tenfold greater than PGE-2 (9 to 14 ng/gm). The release of PGs is variably inhibited (34% to 91%) by diphenhydramine (DP)(1QY M) which suggests that the generation of PGs is in part mediated by histamine through an Hl receptor. The inhibition of PG synthesis by DP is greater when the amount of histamine release is lower. That a non-Hl mechanism for PG release participates in anaphylaxis is suggested by the consistently lower PGE-2/PGF-2a ratio during anaphylaxis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:QBSR9U3j2CEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10883932459717955606&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
