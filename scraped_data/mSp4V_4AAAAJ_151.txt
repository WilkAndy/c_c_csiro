Specifically, these systems and methods utilize competitive history data to provide improved pricing recommendations for sellers. This competitive history data can include a time series of one or more competitor's prices for a set of products. The systems and methods described herein can use this competitor price data with a corresponding time series of seller's data on their product prices and resulting demand to provide improved pricing recommendations to the seller. This use of competitive history data to provide improved pricing recommendations to sellers introduces significant complexity to the optimization of prices. Specifically, this use of competitive history data introduces significant non-convexity to the determination of pricing recommendations. Accordingly, the systems and methods described herein employ a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:pXQX5lkvYSAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6674886182579013081", "cites_id": ["6674886182579013081"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170116624A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2QXJNJ71oVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 5}}
