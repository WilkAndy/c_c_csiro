In laboratories with a lesser degree of automation, sophisticated equipment may be prohibitively expensive. However, with even a small workload handled by continuous-flow machines, manual peak reading is open to error; in these circumstances an inexpensive system, which allows accurate peak reading and which may also be used to correct for base-line drift, would be an advantaae. This paper describessuch a system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Q7hiZQKJ-pAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000456327801500150", "cites_per_year": {}}
