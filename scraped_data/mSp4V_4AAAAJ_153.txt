We develop a spline approximation to time\u2010varying parameters, which includes the constant or annually varying case as two extremes, where the Akaike Information Criterion is used to select an appropriate degree of smoothness, ranging from change in every year to no change at all. Simulation modelling is used to evaluate the performance of this method relative to constant, annually varying, or random\u2010effect parameter estimates when applied to an occupancy model that simultaneously estimates abundance and detectability in multiple sampling strata. We also demonstrate this method by approximating time\u2010varying abundance using 25 years of detection/non\u2010detection data for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2113339137750648567", "cites_id": ["2113339137750648567"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2041-210x.2012.00260.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:98aOs78WVB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
