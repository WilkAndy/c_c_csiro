The model, nicknamed \u2018Consume\u2019, was used to assess the relative extent to which fish diet varied with body size, species identity, season, and location. Both prey type (mean overlap between predicted and actual prey types= 77%) and mean prey size (r 2 between predicted and observed mean prey size= 93%) were predicted with reasonable accuracy when species identity and length of consumer fish were known. The most important predictor for prey type was the size of the individual consumer, while the most important predictor for mean prey size was the consumer\u2019s taxonomic identity. Predictors were individually removed from both k-nearest neighbour and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10558225191638361196", "cites_id": ["10558225191638361196"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v545/p239-249/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bGQvNt9ZhpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
