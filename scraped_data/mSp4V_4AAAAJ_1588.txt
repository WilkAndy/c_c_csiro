Some of these cross sections, notably the Ti (n, p),'Ti (n, p) and Ti (n, p), which find wide use as dosimetry indicators, are compared here with the corresponding ENDF/BIV dosimetry file data.The (n, p) elemental cross tection is constructed from the weighted isotopic components. Our evaluation and the corresponding ENDF/BIV data are compared shoving the great difference between both results, especially below 10 MeV. Moreover the new data exhibit some structures characteristic of the'Ti (n, p) cross section."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:10432045", "cites_per_year": {}}
