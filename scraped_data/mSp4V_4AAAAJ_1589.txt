Two other parent molecules have at last been detected, namely CH3CN and HCN, whereas the observed radicals C2 and C3 suggest complicated unsaturated molecules, whose origin is still controversial (Stief, Shul\u2019man, Kaimakov, Cherednichenko). After the discovery of the Lyman alpha halo, a number of models of the hydrogen atmosphere have been developed. The proper radiation transfer was studied and applied by Keller. The dynamics of the neutral gas in comas has been extensively studied by different workers (Wallis, Shul\u2019man, Mendis and co-workers). Recent work agrees on some general features.
