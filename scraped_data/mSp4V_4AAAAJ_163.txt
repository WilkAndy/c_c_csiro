The Ministerial Direction included a requirement for the development of a harvest strategy policy for relevant Commonwealth fisheries and the implementation of harvest strategies consistent with that policy in all Commonwealth fisheries by 1 January 2007 (subsequently amended to 1 January 2008).This project was developed to assist with the successful finalisation of separate harvest strategies for six minor Commonwealth fisheries. The project continues from the FRDC project \u201cDevelopment of Harvest Strategies for AFMA\u2019s \u2018Small\u2019Fisheries\" and was developed in conjunction with senior AFMA staff as a continuation of the momentum gained during the previous project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10466294869820936686", "cites_id": ["10466294869820936686"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalie-Dowling-4/publication/265579409_Finalisation_of_Harvest_Strategies_for_AFMA%27s_Small_Fisheries/links/54eb01210cf27a6de115891f/Finalisation-of-Harvest-Strategies-for-AFMAs-Small-Fisheries.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7pErNru_P5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
