Introduction. It has long been known that the space of all smooth homeomorphisms of a smooth manifold with the Cl topology can be given the structure of a smooth manifold. A path in this space corresponds to a diffeotopy. It has been shown more recently (1) that the space of all homeomorphisms of a topological manifold is locally contractible when given the C\u20130 topology. A path in this space corresponds to an isotopy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/topology-on-the-space-of-pl-homeomorphisms-of-a-pl-manifold/63438240654BEC2A5E895C372864A483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nSqseQvpLxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
