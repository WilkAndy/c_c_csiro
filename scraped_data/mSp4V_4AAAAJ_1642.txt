With additional colour illustrations by Brian Hargreaves.", "abstract": "This is the first of two handsomely illustrated volumes on the British species of Tortricoidea and deals with the Cochylidae and the Tortricinae, leaving the Olethreutinae for the second volume. It is intended for the non-specialist interested in the Lepidoptera and is not primarily taxonomic in nature. The coloured plates facilitate identification when used in conjunction with the printed descriptions, and care has been taken with the colour of the forewings, which is characteristic for most species. The two senior authors are responsible for the taxonomic and biological descriptions and A. Smith for the drawings of larval spinnings and food-plants and the coloured plates of the Cochylidae, the Tortricidae (with one exception) having been painted by B. Hargreaves. The work contains an introduction, giving general information on the Tortricoidea and their identification, followed by keys to the families, subfamilies and tribes, a list of the British species, and descriptions of individual species with notes on bionomics (including food-plants) and distribution. These are supplemented by the monochrome drawings and the coloured plates. There is a finally a list of larval food-plants, a select bibliography and an index to genera, species and forms, showing synonyms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Xq0QCf40gxIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19730511558", "cites_per_year": {}}
