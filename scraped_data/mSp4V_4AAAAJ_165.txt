Because of its integrated nature, an ecosystem approach was seen as a way to better manage multiple impacts on environments holistically while maximizing long-term economic, social, and cultural benefits. The ecosystem approach also provides for the involvement of a wide range of users and other stakeholders in the management of a spatial area and resources, thus improving coordination and integration in activities. Many different \u2018ecosystem approaches\u2019 exist, ranging from traditional/indigenous approaches to those more recently adopted by Western societies. The theory of how to manage using the ecosystem as the planning framework is still in its infancy and there is no one correct way to implement an ecosystem approach. However, certain principles apply to all current approaches. Perhaps the two bestknown concepts are the complementary ones in use by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)(Garcia et al., 2003) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)(UNESCO, 2000; Shepherd, 2008) with related biodiversity conventions. In practice, however, the most widely implemented approaches are in integrated coastal zone (sometimes area) management (ICZM) and integrated water resources management (IWRM), also sometimes expressed as river basin management (RBM). While not formally called \u2018ecosystem approaches\u2019, they espouse the use of a whole or integrated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5403086105424612900", "cites_id": ["5403086105424612900"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jChhBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA127&dq=info:JM6upC-e-0oJ:scholar.google.com&ots=NGj_TgadJx&sig=jy8l78XnsPmBRQY-lWNz4paUAgo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JM6upC-e-0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
