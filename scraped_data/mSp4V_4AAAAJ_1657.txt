Regular applications of an organophosphate insecticide, demeton-S-methyl, were used to control the insect vectors of the disease. Results indicated that in most seasons BYDV is only a minor disease of wheat in New South Wales. Rhopalosiphum padi appeared to be the most important aphid vector of the disease."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:TNEldfgDb5MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/EA9700502", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sjX4EsY0azgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
