No fewer than 76 species are included in the 35 paintings\u201414 mammals, 51 birds, six fishes and five butterflies. Twenty-three of the paintings are of rarities and the remaining twelve of species which have been introduced to Britain, some of which, such as the rabbit, pheasant and little owl, have become familiar members of our fauna. The reproduction of the plates is excellent but it is somewhat confusing that the captions at the side of each picture are not printed opposite the species to which they refer in some plates such as that of the terns, necessitating reference to the text pages for clarification.Richard Fitter's \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/way-to-the-mountains-of-the-moon-by-rennie-bere-barker-36s/F7A2DC9086FFC97FC0C26B2830DA58BA", "cites_per_year": {}}
