We wish to point out a potential hazard in the azeotropic drying of methyl diazoacetate. Although we have experienced no explosions from this drying procedure, methyl diazoacetate always must be handled very carefully because of its thermal instability [NE Searle, Org. Syn., 36, 27 (Note 8)(1956)]. Inparticular, great care must be taken that the temperature of the residual methyl diazoacetate never approaches the boiling point, either through inattention or electrical malfunction. An additional danger in working with diazoesters arises from the heat of reaction resulting when an acid chloride is added to methyl or ethyl diazoacetate. There is reported in Table I of our paper one reaction of explosive violence, which, however, was not of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:wP5e0sba15sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jo01047a631", "cites_per_year": {}}
