The HSF is built around 4 Tiers corresponding to different amount and quality of information available on stock status. For each Tier, the HSF provides an explicit harvest control rule that produces an RBC (recommended biological catch), which in turn forms the basis for a TAC recommendation. The HSF was used to help set quotas for 28 of the 34 species/stocks in the SESSF quota management system during 2005. While the HSF was generally well received, some problems were identified during implementation in 2005, and further issues have come to light during the assessment phase in 2006. A management strategy evaluation (MSE) project has been funded to test and refine the current harvest strategies, but this will not start to deliver results until later in 2007.
