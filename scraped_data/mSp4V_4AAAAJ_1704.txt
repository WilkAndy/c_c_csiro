Henry Department of Economics", "citation": "", "author": "ADAM SMITH", "abstract": "Adam Smith enjoys a rather precarious position in the development of economic theory. On the one hand, he is recognized as the\" Father\" of the discipline (though not without progenitors--he's not the original Adam). At the same time, his work contains\" dangerous\" elements: one interpretation places Smith squarely in the line of descent that leads to Marx. The primary line of argument, however, purges Smith of dangerous thoughts, developing a lineage that runs from Smith to neoclassicism.The major requirement if the prevailing argument is to hold is that a demonstration be erected that proves Smith either never held a labor embodied theory of value, or, at a minimum, merely consigned this general point of view to the\" early and rude\" level of social development. If this end is not achieved, and if consistency is indeed a virtue, the ongoing attack on Marx must include an attack on the\" Father\" himself.
