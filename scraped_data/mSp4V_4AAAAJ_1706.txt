Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent on dosage and route of administration. With intravenous administration, 80\u201390% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 h. MTX primarily enters the cell through active transport mediated by the reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1). At high extracellular concentrations, MTX also enters cells via passive diffusion of the drug. Once in the cell, MTX exerts its antiproliferative effect by interference with the folate/homocysteine cycle mainly through inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This leads to a lack of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is necessary for nucleic acid synthesis"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Zx2yaX5tUAoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110214499/pdf#page=159", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:unQoUU_yrMwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
