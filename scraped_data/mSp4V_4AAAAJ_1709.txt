Kerr J, Bradbury El, Bennett DLH, Trivedi PM, Dassan P, French J, Shelton DB, McMahon SB, Thompson SWN: J Neurosci 1999, 19: 5138-5148. l 0 Significance: The high affinity binding of neurotrophins to their receptors has so far precluded the development of useful competitive antagonists. In these three papers, the role of neurotrophins in pain pathways is examined both directly and by an indirect approach that involved inhibiting neurotrophin action by exploiting receptor bodies that combine the normal receptor binding site with an immunoglobulin Fc region. The three papers extend previous findings showing that NGF plays a role as a hyperalgesic mediator to demonstrate the actions of both NT-4/5 and BDNF as important regulators of pain pathways. Findings: BDNF and NT4/5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Ted_OrJjFhEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4066253977070424797&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
