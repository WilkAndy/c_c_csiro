The unexpectedly low incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease might be due to a functional alteration of donor T cells after G-CSF stimulation in vivo. Therefore, we analysed gene expression profiles of donor T cells prior to G-CSF stimulation and after 4 consecutive days of subcutaneous injection (10 mikrogramm/kg/day) using high-density cDNA arrays. Hybridisation of the cDNA blotting membrane was performed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes synthesised from total RNA isolated from CD3+ T cells obtained from two healthy donors. In addition, CD4+ T cells were analysed from pools of healthy donors (before and after G-CSF stimulation). About one third of the approximately 400 genes assessed by these arrays, were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Ch_lBrx6vJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/1702911", "cites_per_year": {}}
