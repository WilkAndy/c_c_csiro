There are clearly conflicting perspectives on even the most horrifying slaughters, especially when divisive loyalties\u2212 such as those of race, nationality, class or religious belief\u2212 come into play. Crime has long been a central theme in popular culture and prominent in measures of public anxiety (as registered by opinion polls\u2013although it has been slipping down the hierarchy of concern in the last decade). But what crime is has largely been taken for granted (even though how to explain and tackle it generates fierce controversy). Crime can be seen perhaps as an essentially uncontested concept (to turn on its head the influential notion of \u2018essentially contested concepts\u2019 introduced by Gallie in 1957) but one that ought to be highly contested. The discipline of criminology is evidently defined around the idea of crime, even though some of its most celebrated theories have sought to deconstruct it. But despite all the problems in defining crime that will be elaborated on in this volume, discussions of this underpinning concept have generally been confined to opening chapters (frequently perfunctory) in criminology textbooks. These usually skip rapidly through some controversies and conundrums, before proceeding with the more substantive matters of measurement, explanation and policy. The general playing down of the issue is indicated by the absence of a text that focuses on the concept of crime, although there is a valuable volume of articles that collects important classic and contemporary contributions (Henry and Lanier 2001).
