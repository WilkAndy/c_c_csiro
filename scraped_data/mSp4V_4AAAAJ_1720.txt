A limitation of these models is that they are 55 computationally-limited in the number of trophic compartments, and typically require 56 considerable subjectivity in decisions on how the multitude of animals are grouped 57 (Polovina 1984, Pauly et al. 2000). Species are assumed to act similarly within 58 compartments, regardless that this assumption contradicts Hutchinson\u2019s well known 59 niche paradigm (Hutchinson 1978), in which each species inhabits a unique niche. 60 The validity of dynamic trophic models clearly rests on the appropriateness of theory 61 that underlies modelled relationships, the realism of assumptions, and the purposes to 62 which the model is put. However, consequences of inappropriate trophic 63 categorizations are generally unknown and unknowable, other than when field 64 observations of manipulated communities can be undertaken to validate predictions. 65"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:vLQLSqXM-2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/system/files/Soler_Edgar_Stuart-Smith%20et%20al%20Moving%20beyond%20trophic%20groups%20POSTPRINT.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZtmHKvZbfBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
