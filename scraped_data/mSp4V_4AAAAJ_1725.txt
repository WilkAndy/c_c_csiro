The current stage of development of civilization is characterized by the coexistence of the society and government which in accordance defines the objective necessity of economic distribution of the economic system in the field of material production, services and non-productive sphere. It should be noted that the non-productive sphere is related to the social (socially important) needs to be performed mainly by public authorities through the funds withdrawn from the fields of production and services. At this point, there is narrowing of opportunities for the economic development, and the government gets the instrument of socio-economic processes regulation. That is the essence of the financial phenomenon, which manifests itself in the interaction of monetary circulation with the economic system. This view needs for certain policies to manage the financial system for the purpose of smoothing out fluctuations in the economic growth arising from the use of finance to serve the state. Given that the provision of public services to citizens based on their needs is done just locally, and also that nowadays there occurs deepening of democratic foundations of public life in Ukraine, we believe that the efficiency of the financial policies of local governments is becoming more and more important. Analysis of recent research and publications. Problems of local government financial policy, in particular analysis of the problems of formation and use of resources, taxation, public debt, public credit, pension and insurance coverage, monetary and wage-price controls are studied in the works of Ukrainian scientists such as A.
