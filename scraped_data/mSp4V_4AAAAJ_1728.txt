There are two central questions: how will such an archive work, and what form will the the objects and collections within them take? That is, what is the place/product that would be built to house objects we would like to save in a manner that reflects what we (as information scientists, knowledge organization specialists, archival thinkers) know about storing, accessing and authenticating objects in archives?(Cox, 2004; Duranti, 1998) Secondly, I examine how these objects interact with their surroundings and each other, drawing on scholarship in New media (Manovitch, 2001). As a case study, I look at new media artists experiments in form, and the work of institutions such as Rhizome at the New Museum, a hybrid museum/web forum dedicated to dedicated to the\" creation, presentation, preservation, and critique\" of artistic practices engaging technology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:8_Ku1U0RzzYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.alise.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=196", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:axXT1JMbR24J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
