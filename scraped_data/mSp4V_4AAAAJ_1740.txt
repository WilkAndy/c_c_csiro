The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance of two Ni-based alloys, N09925 and N09935, was assessed via FPBB and creviced fourpoint bent beam (CFPBB) tests under NACE level VII conditions. No failures of either alloy were observed in standard FPBB tests with test durations of up to 90 days. The alloy with the higher Ni content (alloy N09925) passed all of the CFPBB tests for test durations of up to 90 days. Failure of alloy N09935 was observed in one of the CFPBB tests after 90 days exposure, although it passed a separate 180 day CFPBB test. These results indicate that the use of creviced specimens could potentially lead to reduced test durations when qualifying Ni-based alloys for service, although further tests are required to confirm this."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:v-tg9Wi2VGwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gareth-Hinds/publication/273755612_Evaluation_of_stress_corrosion_cracking_resistance_of_Ni-based_alloys_using_a_creviced_four-point_bend_device/links/55b24c7e08aed621ddfdb926/Evaluation-of-stress-corrosion-cracking-resistance-of-Ni-based-alloys-using-a-creviced-four-point-bend-device.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
