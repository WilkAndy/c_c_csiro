Whilst Quantra\u2122 software has not yet been validated with respect to its relationship to risk to the same extent as subjective and area-based methods of density measurement, it holds several advantages over such methods including objectivity, reproducibility, suitability for population-based studies, resolution and the ability to assess absolute, rather than relative, breast density. Regardless of the degree of association with risk, the identification of women with high mammographic density is important because the detection of cancers using conventional mammography is more difficult in this case, and it may be appropriate to use alternative screening methodologies.\u201d The study concludes:\u201cThis study was based on the premise that screening mammography could be made more effective by adapting the imaging modality and the interval to a woman\u2019s individual risk of breast cancer. Breast density plays an important role, not only because it is an important risk factor, but also because it can be altered by lifestyle or other interventions.\u201d"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:jmwITWCuk8IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.hologic.com/sites/default/files/2017/Products/Image%20Analytics/PDFs/Image%20analytics-WP-00026_Abridged%20Clinical%20Results%20October%202013.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
