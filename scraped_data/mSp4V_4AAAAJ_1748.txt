This is based on the individual geological datasets held by each geological survey in Europe, and which may differ considerably with respect to their contents, description and geometry. To make these data interoperable is a considerable task and 1G-E Work Package 3 (WP3) is delivering the essential basis for that endeavour: the 1G-E Data Specification."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:d7BmB2BcYiwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2676681879574564825&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2U_E4Px7JSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
