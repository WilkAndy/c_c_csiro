Recent publications have demonstrated the presence of endocrine active chemicals in leaf extracts from European ecosystems, with oak leaf extracts showing anti-androgenic effects in amphibians1. Little is known, however, about the impacts of European plant leaf extracts on the reproductive systems of native fish species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:lX_RDcPAamoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://cefic-lri.org/wp-content/uploads/uploads/Project%20publications/EMSG55%20CEFIC%202012%20Ann%20Workshop%20Brussels%20-%20Endocrine%20activity%20leaf%20extracts_Brian%20et%20al%20final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d4-vXIJ_dgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
