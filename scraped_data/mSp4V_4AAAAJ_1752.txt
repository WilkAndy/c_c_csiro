The performance required from the AMS system is different for each radioisotope. High precision and high throughput is essential for many 14C applications. For example, ocean circulation models for global environmental studies require the measurement of 14C in more than 10,000 samples with precision as low as 0.3%. Other dating applications in archeology and geology, based on reliable dendrochronological calibrations, often demand the sub-1% precision obtainable with conventional decay counting, yet benefiting from the smallsample and high-efficiency capabilities of AMS. In contrast, a precision of a few percent is adequate for environmental and geophysical applications involving the other radioisotopes having longer half-lives and usually present in not well mixed solid or liquid phases, with a variability in their isotopic ratio spanning orders of magnitude. Other difficulties arise in the AMS detection of these radioisotopes, such as the production of high-intensity negative beams (10Be, 26A1 and 41Ca), the control of isobaric background (^ 6C1) and of high-mass isotopic background (12^ I). The AMS detection methods of long-lived radioisotopes are briefly reviewed in the following in terms of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:JmU_-KX0ghQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/23/061/23061635.pdf#page=126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bKy5jpwX6WEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
