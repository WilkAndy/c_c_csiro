The earliest surviving evidence for Chinese literacy is dominated by records of divinations: attempts to predict the weather, hunting prospects, illness and the behavior of dead ancestors. This course will consider the complex connections between early Chinese writing and religion, divination and administration; the archaeological context of the earliest inscriptions; similarities and differences with early literacy in the Near East and other world regions; and the nature of the writing system and its history of decipherment. Although no prior abilities in ancient or modern Chinese language will be assumed, we will learn to read some of the \u201coracle bone inscriptions\u201d\u2013the earliest surviving texts from China\u2019s long tradition of literacy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:q7hqJx8pYzEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3102525365836027729&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UZdL4WFiDisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
