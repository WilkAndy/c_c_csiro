As the concept of sympathy is clarified during the report, it shows that Smith indeed uses sympathy as the most fundamental principle in explaining human moral nature as opposed to for instance the notion of selflove. Several problems relate to this simple assertion by Smith, those being for instance methodological; the way Smith arranges his arguments in mixing up descriptive and prescriptive statements, meta-theoretical; to the fact that his theory in the end seems rather vague al things considered, and lastly; in regard to the virtue-ethical basis, the theory is very much contingent on his own time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:7LPp1NROPxwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2418612530323313346&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wtI6L0ijkCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
