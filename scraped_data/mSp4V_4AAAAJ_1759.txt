However, oral drug delivery can be inefficient due to poor absorption, hostile conditions eg due to acidic conditions present in the stomach or degradation by digestive enzymes and particularly due to metabolism in the liver (widely known as the \u201chepatic first pass effect\u201d). A relatively slow onset of action can also be an issue following oral administration even for well absorbed drugs. Recent research has therefore focused on drug absorption through nasal epithelia, although rapid clearance can be an issue for simple nasal formulations. To address these problems there has been significant interest in macromolecular-based carrier and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:OmZH4w0uHW8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Harding/publication/300452001_Stability_of_pectin-based_drug_delivery_systems/links/570a685f08aed09e91712492/Stability-of-pectin-based-drug-delivery-systems.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YCyCO7lW1OMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
