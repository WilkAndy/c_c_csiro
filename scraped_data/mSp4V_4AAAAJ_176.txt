Introduction The importance of behavioral factors in determining patterns of transmission in directly transmitted human diseases within small communities has long been established (Bailey, 1957). Studies on the pattern of disease spread through individual households have been of primary importance in the measurement of basic epidemiological parameters such as the latent and infective periods of specific infections \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9V7zk75O24QC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15649345311210572976", "cites_id": ["15649345311210572976"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15649345311210572976&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sIwhkqWkLdkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
