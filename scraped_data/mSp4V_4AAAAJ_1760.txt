The model is estimated using 6,332 observations on women aged 18 years and over. As a benchmark for comparison, we consider the risks faced by a 35 to 44 year old woman who is married with no children, has an English-speaking background, left school at age 17, has no postschool educational qualifications and is currently employed with an income of between $100 and $199 per week. The probability that such a woman will have experienced physical violence within the last 12 months is 6.6%. We find that the risk of experiencing physical violence varies with levels of post-school education (women with undergraduate diplomas are at higher risk), income (an income of between $300 and $499 lowers risk), ethnic background (risks are lower for women from non-English-speaking backgrounds), number of children (risks are lower for women with children older than 15 years), marital status (married women are at lower risk) and age (younger women are more at risk). For women with characteristics which place them in one of the highest risk groups, the probability of having experienced violence within the last 12 months is approximately 42%. We find that employment status, school-leaving age and level of socio-economic disadvantage have no statistically significant impact on the risk of experiencing violence.In the last two decades, efforts to reduce the incidence of violence have resulted in a growing literature on the prevalence and correlates of violence against women with different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:MwHAKEtqQGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/15082/emetwp106.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2Ti2DcpxDtEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
