The possession of a reasonable hypothesis focuses the thinking of the investigator and helps him to concentrate on an addressable portion of what may be, in the environmental sciences, a highly complex problem.In an ecosystem that needs managing, many topics may seem worthy of research attention and it is often difficult to know where research will be most cost-effective. The methodology of systems analysis may here be useful, for it not only stimulates the generation of hypotheses, but also indicates critical assumptions in the hypotheses and hence priorities for research. The increased level of understanding that a system manager may acquire while he carries out the analysis seems likely to improve his capacity to attain his objectives."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:H7P4rdOtXtsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7549198757920119184", "cites_id": ["7549198757920119184"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7549198757920119184&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kBmm4EUkxGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
