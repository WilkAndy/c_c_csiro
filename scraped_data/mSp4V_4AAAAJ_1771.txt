Nothing is known about the patient\u2019s original consultation, but Cullen\u2019s frank response concentrated on a series of lifestyle issues designed to restore strength and preserve health. After telling his correspondent that he had gotten \u2018into a very relaxed state of nerves\u2019, the doctor chided him for eating a rich diet and drinking an entire bottle of claret every day after dinner.\u2018I readily believe that chocolate may be too heavy a breakfast\u2019, Cullen continued, suggesting that he take up cold bathing and \u2018going on horseback as often as weather allows\u2019.\u2018You have been much hurt, I am persuaded, by venery\u2019, he concluded,\u2018but you do not say how you are going to guard against it now\u2019. ii The exchange exemplified Cullen\u2019s role as \u2018hygienist\u2019, a label applied to most contemporary physicians who, in addition of prescribing remedies, also counselled their patients about living healthier lives."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:AU0JsVlt-AkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/37421356/Hyg_Hippo.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
