Recklessness and harassment are not easy concepts to define or prove in any situation but are particularly difficult where the gathering evidence is time consuming and costly and actions are open to mis-interpretation, as in the case of outdoor activities. They are likely to be highly subjective positions which only case law can define, an unhelpful, costly and divisive way of setting out the meaning of legislation. The highly contextual nature of these possible offences mean persons conducting legal operations could be open to speculative accusations. We are not generally supportive of the use of these terms in the legislation without clear contextual definitions.(b) Whether protecting nests from disturbance or species from harassment outside the breeding season will benefit the conservation status of the species population. Our principle concern is that there has been little or no relevant peer-reviewed research conducted into the responses of the named bird species to disturbance or nest site loss outside the breeding season. Thus it is not clear whether they would derive any benefit from such protection. Providing there is a reasonable nesting habitat mosaic there is little evidence that the loss of an individual nest or nest sites will result in population scale effect for any bird species. Newton (1979, 1998) noted that the ranges of sites used by raptor species should not be regarded as static but as malleable within limits, according \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:dZbaGXT4iR0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.gwct.org.uk/media/250084/Schedules-of-the-Nature-Conservation-Act-Scotland-Mar-2009-.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dO-8Duqs23oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
