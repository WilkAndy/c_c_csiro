The means by which conservation may most effectively be achieved is, however, a matter of continuing controversy. In spite of high levels of current interest, conservation should not be regarded as a purely modern preoccupation, for there is evidence from many parts of the world that local initiatives directed at conserving indigenous species have existed for considerable periods of time. Less usual are long-standing conservation measures set up by legislation. Scotland has had legislation designed to conserve the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) since at least the 12th century, and this medieval legislation continues to influence Scottish attitudes toward salmon conservation to the present day.Under legislation, conservation measures become applicable throughout the jurisdiction, and minimum levels of effectiveness may be set. There is much scope for argument among legislators when such enactments are being made or modified, but experience suggests that of greatest significance is who under the law is given responsibility for interpreting the legislation and putting it into effect. In many countries, central or regional governments assume conservation responsibilities. Indeed, many politicians appear to regard direct government control of conservation as sine qua non. To the impartial observer, however, the consequences of governmental control are not invariably in the best interests of that which is to be conserved.
