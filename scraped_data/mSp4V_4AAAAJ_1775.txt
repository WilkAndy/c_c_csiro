The down regulated genes belong to signal transduction, protein degradation (eg ubiquitin-proteasome subunits), dopaminergic transmission/and metabolism, ion transport, protein medification/phosphorylation and energy pathways/glycolysis functional classes. Up-regulated genes, clustered mainly in biological processes involving cell adhesion/cytoskeleton \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:s_OEDnM-dbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8240813478432988680&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
