Here, \u0432 players wish to securely compute some functionality and up to \u0432 1 of these players may be arbitrarily malicious. Previous protocols for this setting (when a broadcast channel is available) require \u0427 (\u0432) rounds. We present two protocols with improved round complexity: The first assumes only the existence of trapdoor permutations and dense cryptosystems, and achieves round complexity \u0427 (log \u0432) based on a proof scheduling technique of Chor and Rabin [13]; the second requires a stronger hardness assumption (along with the non-black-box techniques of Barak [2]) and achieves \u0427 (1) round complexity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:pZ2CosqRuhkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8498447818095170776&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2JTBi0ON8HUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
