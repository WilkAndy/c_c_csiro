Acute Toxicity Standard 96-hour flow-through toxicity tests were conducted accord-ing to the methods described by the Committee on Methods for Toxicity Tests with Aquatic Organisms (1975). The flow-through apparatus employed has been previously described (Smith et al. 1977). Water temperatures were maintained at 25+ 10C. Two aae groups of flagfish were tested: 1) one week; and 2) two months. Nominal TCB concentrations conformed with a recommended concentra-tion series (Sprague, 1973): 2.4, 3.2, 4.2, 5.6, and 7.5 mg/l (ppm). Mean measured TCB concentrations ranged from 1.24 to 3.74 mg/l. Grab samples of water (250 ml) were analyzed for TCB prior to introducing the fish and every 24 hours thereafter, throughout the duration of the test (ie N= 5). When possible, the chemical analysis was performed on both duplicate test tanks at each TCB concentration.
