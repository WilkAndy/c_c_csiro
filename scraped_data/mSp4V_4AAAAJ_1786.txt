We have employed the methods of adiabatic switching and temperature integration over a reversible path to obtain the phase diagram. We discuss the nature of the entropy difference in terms of ion mobility and previous MD calculations of diffusion rates in these systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:hfzGNhXhx5MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S1946427400413187", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7LlMpeoPwxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
