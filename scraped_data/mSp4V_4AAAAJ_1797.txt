Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that the investigational drug has potent anti-cancer activity in tumor models refractory to conventional MTAs. It was shown to arrest tumor cell proliferation and to induce tumor cell death through a destabilizing effect on microtubules which are an intracellular network essential for cell division. In addition, tumor-specific vascular disruption activity was observed in preclinical cancer models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://hbmpartners.com/media/docs/portfolio-news/2014/20140602_Basilea.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o4rC93zE6OYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
