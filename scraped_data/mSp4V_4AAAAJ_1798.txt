Ecosystem\u2014based \ufb01sheries management (EBFM) has emerged during the past 5 y as an alternative approach to single-species \ufb01shery management. To date, policy development has generally outstripped application and implementation. The EBFM approach has been broadly adopted at a policy level within Australia through a variety of instruments including \ufb01sheries legislation, environmental legislation, and a national policy on integrated oceans management. The speed of policy adoption has necessitated equally rapid development of scienti\ufb01c and management tools to support practical implementation. We discuss some of the scienti\ufb01c tools that have been deveioped to meet this need \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14441267424959608299&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6zUjuzWwacgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
