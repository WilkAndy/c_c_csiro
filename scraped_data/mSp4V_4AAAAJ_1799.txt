This voyage took place off around the south-east coast of Australia including Victorian, Tasmanian and South Australian waters, in the areas of the south eastern\" large marine domain\" and the Great Australian Bight Marine Park, during April-May 2000, under the leadership of Rudy Kloser (legs 1 and 3) and Alan Williams (leg 2).Data-set primarliy consists of multibeam echosounder data from approx 30m to 600m water depth from the Simrad EM1002 95kHz multibeam echosounder. Key data outputs are high resolution bathymetry and acoustic seabed backscatter. 15 main sites were intensively mapped with complementary ground truth information comprising video, sediment grab, benthic sled and still photoes being taken"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2584281245880139412&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
