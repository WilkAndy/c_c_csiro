Australian Society for Fish Biology Workshop, Australian Society for Fish Biology, Perth", "abstract": "Management strategy evaluation (MSE) in the broad sense involves assessing the consequences of a range of management strategies or options and presenting the results in a way which lays bare the tradeoffs in performance across a range of management objectives. In contrast to some previous approaches to fisheries assessment, it does not seek to proscribe an optimal strategy or decision. Instead it seeks to provide the decision maker with the information on which to base a rational decision, given their own objectives, preferences, and attitudes to risk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15106757303727542236", "cites_id": ["15106757303727542236"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f18852e205f573dfab300b3ba9b13d17917f48f0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3M-3jLr7pdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 9, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 11, "2009": 14, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 11, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 11, "2018": 12, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
