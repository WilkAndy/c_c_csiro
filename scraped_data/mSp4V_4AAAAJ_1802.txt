Management strategy evaluation in the broad sense involves assessing the consequences of a range of management strategies or options and presenting the results in a way which lays bare the tradeoffs in performance across a range of management objectives. MSE also evaluates outcomes across a range of uncertainties. but generally deals with a wider range of objectives than risk assessment. The role for the assessment scientist adopting an MSE approach is to:* elicit and clarify objectives;* turn objectives into specific attributes and criteria;* identify a range of strategy choices;* identify and quantify uncertainties;* evaluate outcomes;* communicate the results to the decision maker."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/ocrd/275050.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kDoi7Q3RkiwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
