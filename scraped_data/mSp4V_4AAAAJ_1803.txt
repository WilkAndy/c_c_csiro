Arguably, however, this remains an area where policy making has run ahead of science. A growing number of studies identify limitations of offsets in achieving ecologically sustainable outcomes, pointing to ethical and implementation issues that may undermine their effectiveness. Here, we explore several conceptual issues relating to the effectiveness of alternative biodiversity offsetting approaches, using a marine system as an example. We develop a novel system dynamic modeling framework which integrates key components of the broader socioecological system within which offsets operate, and use this model to unpack some of the key drivers identified in the empirical literature as determining the potential success or failure of offsets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ices.dk/sites/pub/CM%20Doccuments/CM-2014/Theme%20Session%20N%20contributions/N0414.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h8M8UfZoM38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
