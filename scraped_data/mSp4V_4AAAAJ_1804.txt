This research project is focussed around the theme of building such primitives from the methods of information theory, and the theory of error-correcting codes.(See the project page on \u201clist decoding\u201d to find out more about \u201cerror-correcting codes\u201d.)Approach:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16267891918351853121&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QWbPPYIpw-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
