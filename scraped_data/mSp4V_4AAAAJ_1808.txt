Detectably secure Byzantine Agreement is discussed in a different abstract [1]. In this work, we investigate such protocols for higher-level tasks. For many joint, multi-party computations, allowing abort is unavoidable: many of the protocols involve only two parties, and in that setting one of the two parties can always walk away from the protocol, leaving the other stranded. Goldreich et al.[2] observed that a similar attack works on any protocol that tolerates collusions containing a majority of faulty participants.Secure function evaluation (SFE)(also called multi-party computation) captures the most general one-stage distributed protocol. The n players in a network wish to calculate some function fx 1 x n \u00b5 of their respective inputs x 1 x n, without a coalition of cheating players being able to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16774209767797214581&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dc1wBen2yegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
