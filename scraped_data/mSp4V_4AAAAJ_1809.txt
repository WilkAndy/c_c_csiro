They also introduce a variety of completely new challenges, since quantum computers represent information very differently from classical computers. This project focuses on understanding how quantum physics affects computation, communication, and cryptography.Issues: This project is investigating a variety of cryptographic and complexity theoretic issues related to quantum information and computation. The following items describe a sample of problems that arise:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2671062072459813212&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XGH8kc2EESUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
