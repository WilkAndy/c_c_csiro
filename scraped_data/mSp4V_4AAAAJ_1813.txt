More detailed individual Stock Assessment Reports (SARs) for selected species within the fishery are also periodically produced. The production of SARs is increasingly the responsibility of individual Fishery Assessment Groups (FAGs) operating under the SEFAG \u201cumbrella\u201d. In 2002/2003, FAGs were active for 5 quota species; blue grenadier (BGAG), blue and spotted warehou (BWAG), orange roughy (ORAG) and redfish (RAG). In addition, a working group has been set up for blue eye trevalla (BEWG). The content and format of the reports produced are standardised across fisheries and this report conforms to those standards.
