This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the tradeoffs in performance of options across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision makers. At a technical level, the MSE framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6098433371065206372&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZMa6ENf8oVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
