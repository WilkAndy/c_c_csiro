The Sellafield Environmental Assessment Model (SEAM)", "pub_year": 1995, "citation": "", "author": "SR Jones and AD Smith and SM Willans and J Gray", "abstract": "A complete discharge history for liquid and aerial effluents has been established for the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. The discharge history was constructed from a detailed search of archived documentation and was validated by comparison with environmental concentration and environmental inventory measurements through use of the Sellafield Environmental Assessment Model (SEAM). In a few cases the cumulative discharge had to be estimated from environmental inventories through the model, rather than from documentary records. Whilst the previously published liquid effluent discharge chronology was essentially unchanged, the aerial effluent chronology was revised, with the cumulative discharge of many nuclides increased substantially. The revised chronologies together with SEAM account very well for the temporal and spatial distribution of radionuclides in the environment of Sellafield. Doses to the population in the nearby village of Seascale have decreased marginally since earlier assessments, despite the increase in assumed atmospheric emissions. This reflects the fact that environmental concentrations were a constraint on the earlier assessments, and also that the dosimetric models of the International Commission on Radiological Protection for some radionuclides have been revised.
