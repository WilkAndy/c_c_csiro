For fisheries that target highly mobile single species with little or no by-catch or habitat impact, marine reserves provide few benefits compared to conventional fishery management tools. For fisheries that are multi-species or on more sedentary stocks, or for which broader ecological impacts of fishing are an issue, marine reserves have some potential advantages. Their successful use requires a case-by-case understanding of the spatial structure of impacted fisheries, ecosystems and human communities. Marine reserves, together with other fishery management tools, can help achieve broad fishery and biodiversity objectives, but their use will require careful planning and evaluation. Mistakes will be made, and without planning, monitoring and evaluation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 933, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12862729485404430000", "cites_id": ["12862729485404430000"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569104000250", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sF55O1GYgbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 9, "2005": 25, "2006": 41, "2007": 34, "2008": 48, "2009": 45, "2010": 54, "2011": 71, "2012": 67, "2013": 64, "2014": 49, "2015": 61, "2016": 58, "2017": 43, "2018": 48, "2019": 66, "2020": 52, "2021": 47, "2022": 30, "2023": 12}}
