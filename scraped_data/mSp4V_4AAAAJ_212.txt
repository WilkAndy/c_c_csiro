Well-organized, deliberate practice with instruction and feedback leads to the best learning and patient outcomes. Professionals in rural/remote locations often face significant challenges in maintaining procedural proficiency and delivering acute care medical services. This is especially important with low-frequency high-stakes procedures. Simulation can play an important role in skills maintenance but limited access to simulation labs and resources in rural areas due to time, cost and distance are often prohibitive. Mobile telesimulation has the potential to facilitate high-quality instruction and overcome these barriers. Our goal is to develop a mobile simulation unit (MSU) that uses acute-care telemedicine mentoring techniques to meet the needs of rural physicians. Methods: The MSU design process is a prototype \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ISkI8zYgihAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6664376515161301311", "cites_id": ["6664376515161301311"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-emergency-medicine/article/p098-development-and-evaluation-of-a-mobile-simulation-lab-with-acute-care-telemedicine-support/A1EC36E15D7617422FE8A0E18A1EF020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PyGlkyGffFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
