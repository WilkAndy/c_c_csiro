Many highly sensitive experiments require low activities both in terms of direct gamma and neutron radiation as well as radon that might emanate from the materials. Specific issues requiring characterization include evaluation of the rock in which laboratory rooms will be emplaced, the design of the cement and aggregate used in shotcreting the laboratory areas used for the physics experiments, estimates of requirements for shielding from radiation from the country rock, and estimates of radon emanation. The rocks of most importance from this standpoint in the laboratory underground include the Poorman Formation, the Yates Member of the Poorman \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:wxweM2R62s8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12580500116425209883", "cites_id": ["12580500116425209883"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.H53A1011R/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G_hImDPqlq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2}}
