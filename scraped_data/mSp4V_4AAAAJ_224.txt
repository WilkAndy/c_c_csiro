Many librarians are not mystified by mega-byte-sized jargon and take MOP-buckets in their stride. Nonetheless those black boxes can still come up with a surprise or two. I know a library which has just installed a new issue system (it hardly matters which brand, since this is just a cautionary tale). This computer has been told to capitalise each word in the book-title (machines don\u2019t have to write in CAPITALS now), which looked a little odd when it came to Richard Iii. It was also given a list of stop-words (The, A, Le, La \u2026 ) which are not searchable, frustrating anyone looking for titles like A B C of \u2026 or A E Houseman or books by Mr Das or Ms Lo.
