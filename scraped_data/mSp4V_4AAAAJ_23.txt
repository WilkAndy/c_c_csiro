The framework involves the application of a set of tier-based harvest control rules (HCR) designed to provide a precautionary approach to management. The harvest strategy framework has been applied from 2005 to 2007, resulting in substantial reductions in quotas across the fishery. The experience in implementing the framework, both positive and negative, is described, and general lessons are drawn. Key lessons include the importance of formally testing such strategies using management strategy evaluation, the impact of external management drivers on implementation of the approach, the need to define strategies for setting \u201cbycatch quotas\u201d in multi-species fisheries, and the need for flexibility and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17337077708888911559", "cites_id": ["17337077708888911559"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783608001835", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x66qCVKsmfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 20, "2012": 17, "2013": 19, "2014": 20, "2015": 14, "2016": 22, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
