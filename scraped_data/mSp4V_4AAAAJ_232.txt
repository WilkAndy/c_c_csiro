Alemtuzumab (ALEM) was compared to ocrelizumab (OCR) and natalizumab (NAT), accounting for societal spillover effects due to RMS treatment.MethodsA Markov model with annual cycles and 20-year time horizon was run separately from US payer and societal perspectives. The societal perspective analysis built upon the payer perspective by including productivity loss costs, informal care costs, and caregiver disutility. For ALEM, the population represented characteristics of pooled treatment-naive and non-naive patients from the CARE MS I and II trials (NCT00530348, NCT00548405).
