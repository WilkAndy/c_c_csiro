Simulation-based training is a valuable tool in the acquisition and maintenance of knowledge and skills; however, simulators are often located in larger centers and they are not widely outside these centers due to geographic, cost and time constraints. Mobile tele-simulation has the potential to overcome barriers but challenges such as comfort, technical issues and ability to teach desired content via tele-simulation must be addressed. We are developing a mobile-tele-simulation unit (MTU) prototype that will enable emergency medicine practitioners and trainees to access simulation-based instruction in rural and remote settings. Methods: Through application of a mixed-methods approach with input of a multidisciplinary team \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:5ct2hXp9qB4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7082034700975047092", "cites_id": ["7082034700975047092"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-emergency-medicine/article/p100-iterative-prototype-development-of-a-mobile-telesimulation-unit-for-remote-training-an-update/3620C5D2901D654F6C97BE40155AAD5B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tIGbzglxSGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
