The role of small pelagic fishes (clupeoids) was highlighted in the context of their importance in maintaining interactions in marine ecosystems. In particular, we examined trophic cascades and possible irreversible changes that promote the proliferation of jellyfishes in marine systems. We found that the presence of large populations of small pelagic fishes has a fundamental role in preserving beneficial trophic interactions in these marine ecosystems. The implications of trophic cascades, such as those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10244009748129544462", "cites_id": ["10244009748129544462"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2013/00000089/00000001/art00013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DnnmQJcIKo4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 18, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 23, "2020": 17, "2021": 21, "2022": 20, "2023": 7}}
