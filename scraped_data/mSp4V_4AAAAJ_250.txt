Uncertainty about stock dynamics is represented as uncertainty about the parameters of these models. The policies tested include an active adaptive policy where management control options are chosen taking into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimates; a range of passive adaptive policies, where controls are chosen assuming parameter estimates are correct, but the estimates are updated from time to time; and a non-adaptive policy where the initial parameter estimates are assumed to be correct and are never updated. Analysis of the regression problems for estimating the parameters of the two models shows that a major factor determining uncertainty about parameter estimates is the variability in observed values of the independent variables in the regression. Where there is more than one independent variable, contrasts between variables are also important. Comparison of policy performances shows that the active adaptive policy always performs well relative to the optimal policy (where the true stock parameters are known). The passive adaptive policy with regular parameter estimate updating generally performs very well but occasionally very poorly. Poor performance occurs when the data points in the regression problem are clustered close to the apparent optimal levels of the independent variables. In most other cases poor initial parameter estimates cause sufficient perturbations in controls to correctly identify parameter values.
