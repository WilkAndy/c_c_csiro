Methods of constructing models of two of these are outlined (though in Fig. 9 of [1] the angle labelled 120 should be 126), and illustrations presented of both of these and a third. The fourth, referred to in [1] as 5 {5,-f}, is a compound of five great dodecahedra. This was so complex that neither an illustration nor any construction notes were offered; for further details readers were referred to a photograph published in a nineteenth-century German journal. Since [1], work by Norman on the Titan computer at Cambridge has resulted in the picture of 5 {5,|} presented here as Fig. 1. terms of use, available at https://www. cambridge. org/core/terms. https://doi. org/10.2307/3616053"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oQ8ZOKt5vhAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1582353901273526675", "cites_id": ["1582353901273526675"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-gazette/article/computer-drawings-of-compounds-of-star-polyhedra/F764D7F17A27A499045AFC47DAB406C8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k7FcUn2m9RUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1976": 1, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
