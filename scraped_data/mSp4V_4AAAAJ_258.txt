We present an exploratory serum biomarker analysis for LEN+ PEMBRO in ICB-na\u00efve pts with advanced RCC.MethodsPts received LEN 20 mg PO daily+ PEMBRO 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Tumors were assessed by investigators per immune-related RECIST. 38 Serum biomarkers were quantified (at baseline, cycle 1 day 15 [C1D15], and C2D1) using custom multi-analyte profile immunoassay panels, SIMOA assays, and ELISA. Baseline biomarker levels were correlated with objective response (OR; complete response+ partial response) via the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and progression-free survival (PFS) via univariate Cox regression analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:s-fFodaFcTIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=339644604560426067", "cites_id": ["339644604560426067"], "pub_url": "https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534(20)40787-2/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U8Sz5PeotgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
