While short lengths of stay are mainly beneficial for patients who genuinely require hospital admission, unnecessary admission to hospital puts the patient at risk of in-patient complications (such as infection and venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, an unnecessary increase in patient admissions will put trusts under considerable administrative and financial pressures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:iOUJLkeIIkEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16174904456214561306", "cites_id": ["16174904456214561306"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16174904456214561306&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GkKNlOfNeOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
