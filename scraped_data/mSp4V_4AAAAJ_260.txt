The objective of the fishery managers is to maximise the value of the harvest, without threatening the sustainability of the fishery. This has been interpreted as to allow the greatest $ value of catch to be taken over the long term, so long as the breeding stock left in the water is likely to be at least 30% of its original level.Central to estimating the value of research for management purposes is a stockassessment model of the fish population. The model mimics the growth and reproduction of the fish according to the best biological information available. Allowing for losses from fishing and gains from growth and reproduction, the model is used to predict the numbers of fish of each age present in each year. From those numbers at age, it calculates the total tonnage of fish in the water in each year. This is how the model estimates biomass or'stock size'and it depends on a known pattern of fishing being provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:XenU2NaEi7IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5717041138016426863", "cites_id": ["5717041138016426863"], "pub_url": "https://www.frdc.com.au/sites/default/files/products/1996-109-DLD.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b5vD9Z8CV08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
