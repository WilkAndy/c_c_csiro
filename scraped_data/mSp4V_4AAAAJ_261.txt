Incomplete and inaccurate mapping of flood risk zones hinders the ability of floodplain managers and planners to guide development to limit exposure and mitigate flood risk. Additionally, reliance on local floodplain maps inhibits more regional and integrated management of rivers and flood risk. Here, we quantify the opportunity to prevent future flood damages by avoiding development in natural floodplain areas. Using a 30m resolution, continental-scale, two-dimensional, hydrodynamic flood hazard model with complete coverage of the contiguous US (Wing et al., 2017) alongside projections of land-use change from ICLUS (US EPA, 2017), permits us to examine the extent to which future developments may be at risk of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Dq9Yj_2b4csC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5749750603797886112", "cites_id": ["5749750603797886112"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.H41M2269W/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oPR17rU3y08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
