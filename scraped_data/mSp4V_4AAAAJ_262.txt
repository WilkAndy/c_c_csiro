We provide a lower bound on the accuracy of estimators for block graphons with a large number of blocks. We show that, given only the number  of blocks and an upper bound  on the values (connection probabilities) of the graphon, every estimator incurs error  in the  metric with constant probability for at least some graphons. In particular, our bound rules out any non-trivial estimation (that is, with  error substantially less than ) when . Combined with previous upper and lower bounds, our results characterize, up to logarithmic terms, the accuracy of graphon estimation in the  metric. A similar lower bound to ours was obtained independently by Klopp et al."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:CtYknXOfbFEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10702581278839805448", "cites_id": ["10702581278839805448"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/imaiai/article-abstract/7/2/169/4092940", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CBb-6Pc0h5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
