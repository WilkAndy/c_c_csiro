This study was designed to explore a perioperative practitioner's knowledge, skill base and education on the subject of awareness. It also explores the practitioner's role in \u2018looking out for\u2019 and \u2018rectification\u2019, their obligations to the patient and their statutory bodies, as well as adherence to standards of conduct, performance and ethics. The paper aims to shed light on this phenomenon and to empower a practitioner to act for the benefit of the service user."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:w_ORaKkuc5QC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15130506778694315730", "cites_id": ["15130506778694315730"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/175045891702700903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0u62F8Bb-tEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
