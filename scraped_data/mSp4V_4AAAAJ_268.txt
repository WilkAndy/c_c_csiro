The Guidebook is part of a P3 Toolkit consisting of tools and guidance documents to assist in educating transportation professionals as well as public sector policymakers, and legislative and executive staff. The P3 Toolkit forms the basis of a broader P3 capacity-building program that includes a curriculum of P3 courses and webinars. The P3 Toolkit addresses Federal requirements related to P3s and four key phases in P3 implementation:(1) legislation and policy,(2) planning and evaluation,(3) procurement, and (4) monitoring and oversight.
