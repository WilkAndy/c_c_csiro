They have increasingly been used in more complex multispecies fisheries, where the by-catch of non-targeted species is common. In these fisheries, the reduction of discards is also being promoted, including recently in Europe with the adoption of a landing obligation under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In part, the debate on the adoption of this obligation focuses on its potential socio-economic impacts, and whether these could be mitigated through either management or industry adaptation. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework to address these issues. We apply this model to a stylized representation of the Australian South-East Trawl fishery, and illustrate how it can be used to explore the bio-economic implications of a ban on discards under alternative scenarios relating to the quota management system, and to potential adaptation options for the fishery."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Ab_9J64Q_yAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10586468200741817732", "cites_id": ["10586468200741817732"], "pub_url": "https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/conference_proceedings_or_journals/ng451k51w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hE0vM72w6pIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
