Background: Consensus criteria require confirmatory testing for definite DPN. Bayes theorem dictates positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) vary based on pretest probability (prevalence). Design/Methods: 366 diabetic patients underwent validated symptom (Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument) and exam (Utah Early Neuropathy Score) scales, NCS and IENFD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using several gold standard definitions and sensitivity and specificity determined. PPV and NPV were modeled based on varying pretest DPN probabilities. The impact of varying cutoffs for specific NCS measures was determined. Results: Mean age was 55 years. 50[percnt] had symptoms, 21[percnt] signs, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_KHj4d_VctIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4732903772509880903", "cites_id": ["4732903772509880903"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/84/14_Supplement/S17.008.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R8KOtOemrkEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
