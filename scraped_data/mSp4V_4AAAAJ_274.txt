The design of healthcare facilities is complex because there are multiple stakeholders, many outcomes and seven flows of medicine that interact. 3P is a Lean design process that takes into account people, products and processes. It is a participative approach that generates a collective design based upon inputs from a wide range of stakeholders and involves them in decision-making relating to potential designs. Healthcare design problems are not simple layout optimisation problems because it is necessary to take into account social factors. Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) is a well-established procedural approach to layout design that has been applied in manufacturing settings, where designers have considered the flow of materials. This paper develops the SLP method to take into account multiple flows and uses it outlines its use for evaluating designs produced by 3P."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:gjA74uKXqp4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7113688053017940416", "cites_id": ["7113688053017940416"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/212947", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wBETI5jluGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2}}
