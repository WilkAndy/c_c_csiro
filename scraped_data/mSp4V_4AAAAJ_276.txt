The underlying theory that institutions shape entrepreneurs' outcomes is well established. However, the ways in which they do so turn out to be quite nuanced and show marked dissimilarities where low income individuals are involved in the entrepreneurship process. Each essay seeks to understand and identify what contexts individuals are more likely to participate in meaningful, development-oriented entrepreneurship. In essays I and III, the focus is on individuals at the bottom of the economic spectrum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:nbnL2fqDbzcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2121568162939767102", "cites_id": ["2121568162939767102"], "pub_url": "https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/businessadministration_etds/63/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PonN7gBTcR0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
