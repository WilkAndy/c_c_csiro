How often do most people change sexual partners? In what ways are different social structures related to sexual behaviours and health outcomes? Answers to these and similar questions are important in determining the need for the management of risky or harmful behaviours and developing effective preventive and intervention approaches. Large-scale national surveys of sexual behaviour have been undertaken partly in response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in the early 1980s and partly as a result of a more generalised increased interest in sexual lifestyles. In Australia, there have been large-scale surveys of the general population (Richters et al. 2014a; Smith et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2003e), nationally representative surveys of secondary school students (Smith et al. 2009; Smith, Agius et al. 2003) supplemented by studies based on convenience samples, and multiple surveys of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communities (Couch et al. 2007; Jin et al. 2007; Jin et al. 2008; Leonard et al. 2012; Pitts et al. 2006; Prestage et al. 2005), again accompanied by studies based on convenience samples. We provide a summary of the key features and outcomes of the numerous studies targeting the general population and young people, reserving a more detailed discussion of research on gay men, lesbians, and transgender people for Chapter 14."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Chu_rVBubhAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1854861312925602947", "cites_id": ["1854861312925602947"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WcwlCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA22&dq=info:g5SLYInKvRkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=e77g2kgwgz&sig=u1F0N7mylsEKagQH0wVgMr2_9vA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g5SLYInKvRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
