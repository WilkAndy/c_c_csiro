The films were sequentially deposited from ultra pure ZnO and Li3PO4 solid targets. Post deposition annealing was carried using a rapid thermal processor in O2 and N2 at temperatures ranging from 500 \u00b0C to 1000 \u00b0C for 3 min. Analyses performed using low temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements reveal luminescence peaks at 3.359, 3.306, 3.245 eV for the co-doped samples. The x-ray diffraction 2\u03b8-scans for all the films showed a single peak at about 34.4\u00b0 with full width at half maximum of about 0.17\u00b0. Hall Effect measurements revealed conductivities that change from p-type to n-type over time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:mfpB_TyaRsUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5049939526760721370", "cites_id": ["5049939526760721370"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-online-proceedings-library-archive/article/properties-of-sputter-deposited-zno-films-codoped-with-lithium-and-phosphorus/83CFC1FA433EC3575249EE2F7B84B243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2uvGbT79FEYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
