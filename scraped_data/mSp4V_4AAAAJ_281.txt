The case reviews the challenges and strategic opportunities for developing, marketing and distributing the Aakash tablet as an information technology to serve bottom of the pyramid (BOP) households. The Aakash tablet offers the promise of opening up a world of new technology to millions of individuals in India and other emerging markets around the world that comprise the BOP. Building on the experience of other IT companies in effectively using intermediaries to help overcome production and distribution hurdles in BOP markets (Heeks, 2012), the authors suggest developing new strategic alliances in rolling out this unique value proposition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:AU_EAA-G7qsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16649416728866419549", "cites_id": ["16649416728866419549"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJTMKT.2013.056887", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XXOHcU2cDucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
