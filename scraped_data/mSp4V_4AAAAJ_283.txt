The ability of these disciplines to capitalize on biomimicry\u2019s potential largely depends on the education and training of students who can work successfully to deploy this emerging methodology. Since 2008 InnovationSpace, a transdisciplinary product-development program at Arizona State University, has been developing a curriculum for using biomimicry as a means of inspiring and evaluating sustainable innovation. This chapter describes the challenges and opportunities for educators in integrating biomimicry into a transdisciplinary product-development curriculum. Included are examples of InnovationSpace student projects that use natural models and principles in solutions to design, business, and engineering problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:TxN98J45HB8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17406351587919057378", "cites_id": ["17406351587919057378"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=48czEtUY908C&oi=fnd&pg=PA313&dq=info:4tF44YvIj_EJ:scholar.google.com&ots=5MufBzb5E5&sig=JBj4Q3qNxRmv-c3biHJmvryneno", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4tF44YvIj_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
