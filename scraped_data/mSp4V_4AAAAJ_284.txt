Tier 3 species are those that do not have a formal stock assessment, but do have information available on the age frequencies of annual catches, annual total catch weight, and knowledge of basic biological parameters such as the natural mortality rate (M), agelength relationships, length-weight relationships, stock-recruitment relationship steepness, age at maturity and age at recruitment to the fishery."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18247486219013177432", "cites_id": ["18247486219013177432"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50279171/Alternative_Tier_3_assessment_methods_an20161112-31151-1p6e2dg.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WMAdcAkYPP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2}}
