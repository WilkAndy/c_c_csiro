Assessments of the stock indicate that there was a substantial decline in abundance during the late 1970s and early 1980s and that the year classes spawned at the end of the 1980s were much weaker than expected from the (estimated) stock\u2013recruitment relationship. The performances of a variety of alternative management procedures are contrasted. The factors considered in the operating models include uncertainty about historical catches, the comparability of recent survey estimates, the form of the stock\u2013recruitment relationship, whether variations in recruitment about the stock\u2013recruitment relationship are auto-correlated, and the quantity and quality of the data available for assessment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12434892109998532322", "cites_id": ["12434892109998532322"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/56/6/860/658134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4ibFvH2ckawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 12, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 11, "2008": 13, "2009": 11, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
