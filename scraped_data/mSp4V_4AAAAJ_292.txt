They are researched responses to the range of issues and questions which have been current in UK higher education over the last five or six years. Future social historians will surely discern, through their tiny print and clear thought, the growing instrumentality of this era, the nervous concern of the authorities, as costs rise, to ensure that university education brings economic benefit to the nation as a whole."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:CKf5m1HYVjMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=936188051490774350", "cites_id": ["936188051490774350"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0011-1562.2004.00588.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Tp0SnBIC_gwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
