Methods: All patients who underwent patellofemoral arthroplasty for patellofemoral osteoarthritis between 1992 and 1998 in two district general hospitals were studied. Three authors not directly involved in the patients care assessed the patients by:   both a modified Hungerford and Kenna knee rating system and Insall and Crosby grading system, and   asking whether surgery had been worthwhile and whether they would go through it again.
