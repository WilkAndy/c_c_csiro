Consequently they are often broadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate directly in management plans. Predicting the results of any management action is very uncertain because the dynamics of ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to design and evaluate operational management strategies have advanced considerably in the past decade. These management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on simulation testing of the whole management process using performance measures derived from operational objectives. The MSE approach involves selecting (operational) management objectives, specifying performance measures, specifying alternative management strategies, and evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 671, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3671756089740803930", "cites_id": ["3671756089740803930"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/57/3/731/635993", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wr_gtrWy9DIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 19, "2005": 18, "2006": 23, "2007": 41, "2008": 42, "2009": 42, "2010": 40, "2011": 39, "2012": 39, "2013": 43, "2014": 26, "2015": 43, "2016": 51, "2017": 37, "2018": 38, "2019": 45, "2020": 21, "2021": 22, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
