The reef line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) operates under multiple jurisdictions in a World Heritage Area with diverse stakeholder agenda for conservation and commercial and recreational harvest. We worked with stakeholders to identify: (i) specific objectives; (ii) alternative management strategies; and (iii) performance indicators to compare likelihoods of meeting economic, recreational and stock objectives for the fishery and conservation objectives for the effects of line fishing on the GBR.
