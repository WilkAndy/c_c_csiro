They vary, both within and between species, in the ways in which environmental variations influence these parameters. A \"metapopulation\" view of their ecology is taken and it is argued that variation of several kinds--in particular recruitment variability--may explain the coexistence and relative abundances of a large number of potentially-competing forms; in other words it may partially explain the diversity of the system. The implications of such a model for the management of a marine system such as one of the South Australian Gulfs are examined. In its qualitative form the model gives some useful guidance, a simplified mathematical version is being written and will have heuristic value, but its further development will require a program of adaptive or \"feedback\" management. It is crucially important that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1082436944760247844", "cites_id": ["1082436944760247844"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1082436944760247844&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JJYxkKqWBQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
