The etalons were designed for maximum performance near normal incidence and for 125 \u00c5 radiation, close to the silicon L absorption edge. The structures were fabricated with a dc sputtering technique and consist of two molybdenum/silicon multilayers separated by a silicon spacer. The samples have been characterized by several complimentary methods and reflectivity measurements have been made using synchrotron radiation. The reflectance has a sharp maximum (27%) for 124 \u00c5 light incident at 10o from normal. Interference effects between the two reflectors, through the spacer, are clearly demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:B2sTq_F-V64C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3787967496389666623", "cites_id": ["3787967496389666623"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/0984/0000/Monolithic-Fabry-Perot-Structure-For-Soft-X-Rays/10.1117/12.948795.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PycIU16QkTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
