It is only by the aggregation of precedents and conflicts that the paradoxes of national policy can be derived; thus Smith sees national policies in communications as communications \u201ccultures.\" Although no consistent philosophy or system of governance is perceptible, certain specifically British characteristics are present, in particular a peculiarly adept political stand-off; and so far communication institutions have remained sufficiently stable to be immune to the pressures of any single political administration.Most of the people who spend their lives in Britain in the newspaper, broadcasting, publishing, telecommunications, and cinema industries would be as surprised to hear that they were part of a national communication policy as the character in Moliere was when told he had been speaking prose all his life.
