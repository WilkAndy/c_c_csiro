Twenty-one patients (33%) developed DVT in the six days following surgery. Five clinical variables were significantly associated with subsequent DVT - age, per cent overweight, varicose veins, female sex (all positive risk) and cigarette-smoking (negative risk). Using clinical variables a high-risk group (> 60% DVT) could be separated from a low- risk group (< 10% DVT). None of 20 laboratory variables was significantly associated with DVT, but several (fibrinogen, factor VIII, plasma viscosity, blood viscosity, and serum fibrin degradation products) were associated with malignancy, infection or jaundice, which limits their usefulness in prediction of DVT in this group of patients.
