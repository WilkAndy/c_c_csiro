Slight differences between optical density signatures of plots with different spray schedules preceded corresponding differences in infection levels that were not visually apparent on the date of photography but were visually apparent later. The technique of density signature development allowed consistent and quantitative differences to be recorded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:hqmOYzVsQHMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10186568155838332867", "cites_id": ["10186568155838332867"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02851585", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w78MWcT1XY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
