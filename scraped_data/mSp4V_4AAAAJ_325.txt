Though the general urbanization impacts of increased storm runoff peaks and reduced baseflows are well known; how the complex, non\u2010stationary interaction of the dominant water fluxes within dynamic urban water stores sustain streamflow regimes over longer periods of time is less well quantified. In particular, there is a challenge in how hydrological modelling should integrate the juxtaposition of rapid and slower flow pathways of the urban \u2018karst\u2019 landscape and different approaches need evaluation. In this context, we utilized hydrological and water stable isotope datasets within a modelling framework that combined the commonly used Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrological Modelling System (HEC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:HTTuFT0SUJcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1636866040897155041", "cites_id": ["1636866040897155041"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.14814", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
