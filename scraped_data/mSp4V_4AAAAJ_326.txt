It was first described over 100 years ago with limited reports in the literature since then. Its similarity in presentation to testicular neoplasia poses a significant challenge in diagnosis and management, often resulting in radical orchidectomy. We present the case of a 31-year-old man who presented with a rapidly growing left-sided testicular mass and suspicious ultrasound findings; histology from the subsequent radical inguinal orchidectomy showed findings consistent with splenogonadal fusion. We describe points for consideration in the clinical history, examination and imaging that could suggest splenogonadal fusion, including preoperative technetium-99m-sulfur colloid imaging and intraoperative frozen section evaluation, which may confirm the diagnosis and prevent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YWc4VMBnCPMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12519588677402716534", "cites_id": ["12519588677402716534"], "pub_url": "https://publishing.rcseng.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dmmXCpKDvq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
