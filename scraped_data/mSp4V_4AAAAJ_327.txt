Although lipid metabolism is established as crucial to numerous biological processes, the genetic factors that influence inter\u2010individual variation are still not well understood. To address this issue, we apply an integrative approach to link genetic variants with altered lipid metabolism and AD.Lipidomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography coupled electrospray\u2010ionization tandem\u2010mass spectrometry on 4,492 genotyped individuals from the Busselton Family Health Study. We performed genome\u2010wide association analysis of 596 lipid species and 33 lipid classes using linear\u2010mixed models, correcting for age, sex, their interactions, 10 genomic principal components and an empirical genetic relatedness matrix.
