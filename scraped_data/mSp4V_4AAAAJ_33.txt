While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=98745820050235174", "cites_id": ["98745820050235174"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783614003300", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jh8m18zQXgEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 24, "2022": 17, "2023": 13}}
