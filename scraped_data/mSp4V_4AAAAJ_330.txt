We report here a series of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV inhibitors that demonstrate potent activity against a range of Gram-positive and selected Gram-negative organisms, including clinically-relevant and drug-resistant strains. In part 1, we present a detailed structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis that led to the discovery of our previously disclosed compound, REDX05931, which has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.06 \u03bcg mL\u22121 against fluoroquinolone-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although in vitro hERG and CYP inhibition precluded further development, it validates a rational design approach to address this urgent unmet medical need and provides a scaffold for further optimisation, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:G546HapNa1AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2496670383206457068", "cites_id": ["2496670383206457068"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/md/d0md00174k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7F5CUHz0pSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
