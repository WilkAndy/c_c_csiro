Genetic variation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) locus is associated with altered HDL\u2010C. We aimed to assess AD risk by genetically predicted HDL\u2010C.Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms within the CETP locus predicting HDL\u2010C were applied to the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) exome chip stage 1 results in up 16,097 late onset AD cases and 18,077 cognitively normal elderly controls. We performed instrumental variables analysis using inverse variance weighting, weighted median, and MR\u2010Egger.Based on 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms distinctly predicting HDL\u2010C in the CETP locus, we found that HDL\u2010C was not associated with risk of AD (P > .7).Our study does not support the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:F-CH8NBHAGkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8141564246572929942", "cites_id": ["8141564246572929942"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.dadm.2018.08.008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lhMA4Yul_HAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
