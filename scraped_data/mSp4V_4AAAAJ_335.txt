Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) ability to secrete anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory factors represents an attractive tool in the treatment of osteoarthitis. Considering the risk of cell leakage and the massive cell death upon intra-articular injection, MSCs encapsulation therefore could prevent cell death, avoid cell effusion outside the articular space, and supply a suitable micro-environment supporting the biological activity of MSCs. Previously, we have demonstrated that alginate particles support MSCs viability and bioactivity. Nevertheless these particles obtained through a dropwise method had an average size of 1.5\u00b10.2 mm and were thus too large to be injected into joints. Here, we propose to develop a method of cell encapsulation in alginate compatible with intra \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:K0rJQjkOV9sC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10268100864547204281", "cites_id": ["10268100864547204281"], "pub_url": "https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(17)30711-2/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uaw3ZVWff44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
