The methods for  providing this information will vary, and several other methods exist in addition  to numerical simulations as demonstrated in previous chapters in this volume.  We introduce three categories of such methods for providing information to  support management decisions: expert judgment, use of mathematical models  not involving simulations, and qualitative approaches. Some of these methods  are suitable either as a first step in providing information on which to base  advice for fisheries management, to be augmented subsequently by more targeted numerical simulations, or else when numerical simulations are impossible  due to lack of knowledge, data, or resources to build appropriate models and  carry out extensive simulations, or when the complexity of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12309958142583209296", "cites_id": ["12309958142583209296"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315751443-27/introduction-alternative-methods-providing-scientific-information-management-verena-trenkel-sarah-kraak-jake-rice", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UH2ZsLXB1aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
