BACKGROUND:CIPN causes pain, sensory loss and reduced quality of life and is the most common dose limiting chemotherapy side-effect. Effective pain treatment exists but symptoms are often undertreated and a universally accepted evidence based patient care model is lacking. DESIGN/METHODS:Chemotherapy patients were randomized to Symptom Care (SC), an automated telephone system with nurse practitioner (NP) follow-up, or Usual Care (UC). Patients logged symptom severity daily on 0-10 scales for 11 symptoms including numbness. The SC cohort received automated symptom specific advice and those reporting moderate/severe symptoms (score \u88054) received NP phone follow-up with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:hG410n-4ytkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8386981468207228429", "cites_id": ["8386981468207228429"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/84/14_Supplement/P7.095.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DaZGjjWLZHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
