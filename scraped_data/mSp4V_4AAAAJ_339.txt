The secondary aim is to assess fall related morbidity. BACKGROUND:Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most common dose limiting side-effect of many commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics. CIPN is known to reduce quality of life, but its relationship to adverse outcomes such as falls and fall related injuries is unknown. DESIGN/METHODS:Patients beginning chemotherapy were recruited for automated telephone monitoring of chemotherapy related symptoms, falls and complications. Daily, patients logged symptom severity on 0-10 scales for 11 symptoms. Scores \u8805 4 were deemed moderate/severe. Reported fall events (falls and near falls) prompted questions about the nature of the fall and consequences. RESULTS:165 patients enrolled. Age was 55 +/- 12 years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:O1EiIK0CsDMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3383882397689726265", "cites_id": ["3383882397689726265"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/84/14_Supplement/P7.082.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OUX-sxz39S4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
