We used a global meta\u2010analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet\u2010wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch\u2010to\u2010quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16228503020141905841", "cites_id": ["16228503020141905841"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00429.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sYfpt4M5N-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
