Nerve conduction studies (NCS) typically reveal reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes with an incremental response to rapid (30-50 hertz) repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) in 50%.Design/Methods: Twelve adult prisoners developed confirmed botulism after consuming alcohol made from fresh and canned fruit and potatoes (\"Pruno\"). All patients were triaged in the emergency department or via teleconference in the prison infirmary; 8 were admitted. Clinical and electrodiagnostic features are reported on the admitted patients. Each underwent NCS including 3 and 50 hertz \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3MbNWxKZGl0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7111501426833946319", "cites_id": ["7111501426833946319"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/78/1_Supplement/P04.093.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z_Yejt4gsWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
