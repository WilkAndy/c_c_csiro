Some investigators have reported that AMH is the most sensitive predictor of both over-and under-response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). The evidence for AMH as a marker of over-response is strong; however, evidence for its role as a marker of poor response is much weaker, and its value for prediction of poor response is questionable. Although several studies found no association of AMH with pregnancy and live birth rates in COH, others have. Therefore, a role for AMH in predicting pregnancy outcome is unproven."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:xplVlPkBRTwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13672144260602844249", "cites_id": ["13672144260602844249"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/fulltext/2011/12000/Anti_M_llerian_Hormone_Tailored_Stimulation.13.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WdQgU8Q2vb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
