At their most recent sexual encounter, men who reported FAI at age 16\u2005years or younger were more than twice as likely to have had receptive anal intercourse or reciprocal anal intercourse (both insertive and receptive in the same sexual encounter), and were almost twice as likely to report having more than 10 sexual partners in the past year. These men were also nearly twice as likely to have become HIV-positive since their sexual debut and were several times as likely to report having had a hepatitis A or C diagnosis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:UlRcoTO8nVoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13999466896500353858", "cites_id": ["13999466896500353858"], "pub_url": "https://sti.bmj.com/content/87/Suppl_1/A252.2.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qmu-UvgYSMIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
