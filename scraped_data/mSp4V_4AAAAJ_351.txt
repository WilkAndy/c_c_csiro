It is imperative that researchers focus on the key challenges in building a trustworthy cyber infrastructure. To this end, the National Science Foundation held a Workshop on Trustworthy Computing on October 27-29, 2010 in Arlington, Virginia to bring researchers together to discuss challenges and future directions. The workshop focused on the NITRD Cybersecurity R&D Themes from the Federal Cybersecurity Game-Change Research Agenda (\u201cNITRD themes,\u201d hereafter) and the general challenge of improving the Science of Cybersecurity. The result of this workshop is a set of research challenges identified by the workshop participants proposed as key areas for scientific investigations for a future trustworthy cyber infrastructure. The workshop was attended by security researchers with experience in research topics related to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:n1qY4L4uFdgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11336839045009360346", "cites_id": ["11336839045009360346"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11336839045009360346&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2sWP2QuLVJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
