IgG titers against PLY were determined by ELISA. The ab-PLY was run on a gel to rule out contamination. Rabbits were treated with intravitreal ab-PLY, 400 \u00b5g (n= 6) and 200 \u00b5g (n= 3) and sham intravitreal injections with either PBS or vancomycin (n= 4). In the infection group, E353 strain of S. pneumoniae (10 2 CFU/10\u00b5l) was injected intravitreally into one eye of each animal. 24 hours later, the rabbits were divided into 3 groups; V gp (1mg/0.1 ml intravitreal vancomycin: n= 3); V/ab-PLY gp (intravitreal vancomycin+ 200 \u00b5g ab-PLY: n= 3) and control (untreated: n= 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:QaLwMs-zPFMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4240899401882806389", "cites_id": ["4240899401882806389"], "pub_url": "https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2367480", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dShkaYmz2joJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
