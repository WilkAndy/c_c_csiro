Smith, and G. Collins (eds.)", "pages": "112-116", "abstract": "Thrips are a consistent and predictable insect pest of seedling cotton in Georgia and the southeast. In general, thrips infestations are higher on early planted cotton compared with late May and June plantings. Thrips feed on cotyledon leaves initially and then move to the growing point to feed on newly forming leaves. Thrips injury results in crinkled distorted true leaves, stunted or reduced seedling growth, delays in maturity, reduced yield potential, and in severe cases loss of apical dominance or stand loss. Thrips injury is also compounded by slow seedling growth resulting from other plant stresses such as cool temperatures. Most growers choose to use a preventive systemic insecticide at planting in the form of granules applied in the seed furrow or a commercial seed treatment to aid in management and control of early season thrips. Preventive treatments vary in efficacy and residual activity, and it is important that growers understand treatment performance and attributes.Research has demonstrated a consistent yield response when preventive systemic insecticides are used. However, supplemental treatment with a foliar insecticide is sometimes needed. The threshold for foliar application of an insecticide for early season thrips is 2-3 thrips per plant and immatures present. The presence of immature thrips suggests that the preventive insecticide used at planting is no longer active or not providing control. Foliar treatments for thrips are rarely necessary once plants reach the 4-5 leaf stage and are growing vigorously."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3U6lgfQs5JwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14550671632981198133", "cites_id": ["14550671632981198133"], "pub_url": "http://www.ugacotton.com/vault/rer/2009/p112RER2009.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NYUy58Fe7skJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
