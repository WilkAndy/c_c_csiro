However, President George W. Bush has also had a major influence on the way in which we discuss and research oral sex. By promoting abstinence as a major strategy to reduce the risk of sexually transmissible infections (STI) and HIV, President Bush inadvertently also raised the issue of oral sex and a debate about \u2018technical virgins,-young people who might engage in oral (or anal) sex while remaining technically virgins. The issues of what counts as sex and what one can actually do while remaining sexually abstinent are important questions. Effective communication about any topic requires agreement about the meaning of key terms-something that is currently lacking when talking about \u2018sex,. The challenge presented by this fluidity in meaning is compounded by the large-scale shifts in sexual cultures that have occurred in the past and continue into the future.The age at onset of sexual activity has been declining in Australia for at least the past 50 years. 1 Our surveys of secondary students demonstrate that the proportion of Australian students in Year 10 (median age 15 years) who reported having experienced sexual intercourse rose from 19.7% in 1997 to 32.0% in 2002. 2 This is, of course, a restrictive definition of what it means to be sexually active: 76.6% of those students reported having experienced deep kissing, 61.3% touching or being touched on the genitals and, notably, 37.3% giving or receiving oral sex. 2"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:TPlbvKeUp3cC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2569288483963140194", "cites_id": ["2569288483963140194"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a254dbde66023a1874bb40723325544015a09f4a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YvgfdEPypyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
