Flight experiment (FE) and asynchronous ground control (AGC) cultures of Streptomyces lividans (pIJ702) were screened for putative mutations in the tyr gene required for melanin synthesis. In flight samples, loss of plasmid expression in FE clones was 8-fold lower than that for AGC cultures. Streptomyces coelicolor strain Ac-236 with several auxotrophic marker genes was screened for spontaneous revertants and the arginine and proline genes were amplified for sequencing to characterize the genetic changes resulting in prototrophy. Ribosomal DNA was extracted from FE and AGC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus pumilus, Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus casei and analyzed for mutations. No genetic changes were detected. The results suggest that there is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:7q7mz_VC1OIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2056084209115827686", "cites_id": ["2056084209115827686"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ESASP.663E..87G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5o2j0LGtiBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
