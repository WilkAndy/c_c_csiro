Why so? What is so important about the emerging church movement (henceforth, ECM) that a major Christian scholar would be so compelled to write a book that promises to help people become conversant with it? Like a tour guide in a foreign land showing us the sights and sounds, Dr. Carson sets out to help us understand a movement and its implications for Christians in our North American context.Whenever a Christian movement comes along that presents itself as reformist, it should not be summarily dismissed. Even if one ultimately decides that the movement embraces a number of worrying weaknesses, it may also have some important things to say that the rest of the Christian world needs to hear. So I have tried to listen respectfully and carefully; I hope and pray that the leaders of this\" movement\" will likewise listen to what I have to say. 1"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:B9zx5l6rxUEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1801173694555828232", "cites_id": ["1801173694555828232"], "pub_url": "https://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/ref-rev/14-4/14-4_smith2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CDDHou4N_xgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
