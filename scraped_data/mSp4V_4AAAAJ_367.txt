On FDA approval, this product will be marketed as Palladone Capsules. TM Two Phase 3 studies were pooled providing up to 135 patients with persistent pain for each covariate (age, gender, race, or renal function) and the data analyzed via a pharmacokinetic (PK) screen approach. Dose-normalized PK metrics AUC and Cmin were determined at steady state for individual patients. With increasing age, mean dose-normalized hydromorphone PK metrics showed a slight but clinically insignificant increase. There was significant overlap between age groups. Gender analysis indicated that the mean PK metrics differed by approximately 20 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:aKo_o5XvxeMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4634850680959763959", "cites_id": ["4634850680959763959"], "pub_url": "https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(04)00278-0/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:94WVSSNMUkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
