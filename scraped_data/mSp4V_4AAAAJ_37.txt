Clearly specified management targets are a key element of effective fisheries management. Biomass targets are often specified for major commercial fisheries that are managed using quantitative stock assessments where biomass is calculated and tracked over time. BMSY, the biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield, is often used as a target when maximizing yield is important, while BMEY is the biomass target to maximize profit. There are difficulties in estimating both quantities accurately, and this paper explores default proxies for each target biomass, expressed as biomass levels relative to carrying capacity, which are more easily estimated. Integration across a range of uncertainties about stock dynamics and the costs of fishing suggests that a proxy for BMSY in the range of 35\u201340% of carrying capacity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2106755709098087998", "cites_id": ["2106755709098087998"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/71/3/469/636159", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PlZRxSezPB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 19, "2017": 12, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
