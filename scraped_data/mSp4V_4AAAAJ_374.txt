However, the increase in catabolic processes that develop within articular cartilage in joints exhibiting early signs of OA is balanced initially by an up-regulation of anabolic/repair events. Osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family (BMP), is known for its ability to induce the synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) components and to overcome the effects of catabolic mediators like interleukin-1 and fragments of fibronectin and collagen type II. As we have shown previously (1), human adult articular chondrocytes express endogenous OP-1 mRNA and protein. The purpose of the current study was to delineate the role of endogenous OP-1 in human articular cartilage via the inhibition of OP-1 gene expression by phosphorothionate antisense oligonucleotides (ASO).MATERIALS AND METHODS."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:yS0fcbgecPsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18015490516316052482", "cites_id": ["18015490516316052482"], "pub_url": "http://www.ors.org/Transactions/49/0598.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AtxvpyzhA_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1}}
