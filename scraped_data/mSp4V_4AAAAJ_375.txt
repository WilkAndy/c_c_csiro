This habitat is important for extensive livestock production, game management and is of international importance for biodiversity and landscape. Maintaining and improving it by balancing management need and economics are the subject of considerable debate because of the sometimes conflicting demands of the land users. These difficulties are exacerbated by problems associated with obtaining accurate information on vegetation state and change. Heather moorland is managed both intensively and extensively by burning and grazing over large areas of land, often several thousand hectares in extent. The aim of the study was to differentiate between distinct classes and qualities of heather moorland at a realistic scale to aid management. The principal components of the work were the field characterisation of heather dominant moorland and the manipulation of data from within the 7 bands of Landsat thematic mapper. Previous remote sensing studies have shown that heather dominated areas can be differentiated from other habitat types. No previous publications have been made of the characterisation of the heather dominated areas other than sub-species composition. Field sites were established in upper Strathspey, located in the Grampian Mountains of Scotland. Field recording and sampling took place at the beginning, middle and end of the growing season to coincide with the different growth phases of the plants; spring growth, late summer inflorescence and winter dormancy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:lrH_6YXCPtsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2814224759096926092", "cites_id": ["2814224759096926092"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Waterhouse/publication/302118864_Characterisation_of_Calluna_vulgaris_dominant_moorland_using_remote_sensing_with_Landsat_TM/links/572e46fb08aeb1c73d129576/Characterisation-of-Calluna-vulgaris-dominant-moorland-using-remote-sensing-with-Landsat-TM.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jN8UDIIiDicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
