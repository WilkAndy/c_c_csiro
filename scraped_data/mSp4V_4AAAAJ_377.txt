From December 1988 to December 2000, 108 patients 18 years or younger were referred for LT; 50 of these underwent a total of 53 transplants. The most common indications were biliary atresia (32%), metabolic disease (26%), and acute hepatic necrosis (26%). The majority of deaths (6/7) occurred in the 1st week after LT. The actuarial survival at 1 year was 88% (95% CI 75% to 94%) and at 10 years 85% (95% CI 71% to 93%). Survival rates were highest for children aged 3 to 14 years (95%) and lowest in those weighing less than 8 kg at the time of LT (66%). All 43 survivors are attending age-appropriate activities including kindergarten, school, and employment.
