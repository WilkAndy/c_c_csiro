The evaluation examined the performance of the project, and barriers to its success across the project\u2019s KRAs.Progress towards the project objectives was assessed on the basis of available surveillance data. Given the centrality of the surveillance system to monitoring the performance for the TSP, the surveillance system itself was examined. The key domains of the system examined were its simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and timeliness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:nvAonm6-wpUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11862777037310596631", "cites_id": ["11862777037310596631"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jon-Willis/publication/237145431_Improving_the_sexual_health_of_Indigenous_Australians_An_evaluation_of_the_Tri-State_HIVSTD_project/links/0deec51b92afc375e1000000/Improving-the-sexual-health-of-Indigenous-Australians-An-evaluation-of-the-Tri-State-HIV-STD-project.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FxaPHt0MoaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1}}
