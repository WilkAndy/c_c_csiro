However, a recent study by Meftah et al [3] found a close correlation between the distance between rows of surface asperities and subjective roughness, again raising the question about whether friction co-varied with spatial period and roughness. The objective of the present study was to examine how normal and tangential forces at the fingertip were deployed in active tactile exploration of textured surfaces in order to determine the contribution of friction to the subjective magnitude estimations of roughness. In the first experiment, six volunteer subjects were asked to scale the roughness of 8 surfaces using a single stroke of the middle finger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:XEKcsfOMjpkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2938677273669661509", "cites_id": ["2938677273669661509"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2938677273669661509&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RfOXHmlHyCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
