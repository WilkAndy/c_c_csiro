Among them, Ser-262 and Ser-400 were abnormal phosphorylation sites of tau protein found in Alzheimer disease. As the above phosphorylation only slightly inhibited the biological activity of tau protein, it was concluded that phosphorylation of tau protein at Ser-262 and Ser-400 might not be critical to its biofunction, and that GSK-3 alone was not enough to reproduce Alzheimer pathology of tau protein."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:mi32SFrLcAQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7449363393797286265", "cites_id": ["7449363393797286265"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/cba/321829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eekVyol0YWcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
