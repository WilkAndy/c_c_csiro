The exposures taken with the F160BW and the F218W filters of the WFPC2 verify previous IUE work and show that the most luminous starburst knots are confined to the inner 3 Kpc region of NGC 1068. The GHRS spectroscopy of five of these knots, sampling from 1170 to 1460 Angstroms, indicate strong P Cygni features in both doublets of NV lambda lambda 1238, 1242 and Si IV lambda lambda 1393, 1402. The presence of NV represents the clear presence of O stars younger than 6 Myr in all the knots sampled. Numerous photospheric features are also seen. Detailed theoretical spectral fits assuming single and multiple bursts, as well as continuous star-formation, are compared with the observed UV spectra. These fits suggest that the ages of these knots \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:z2g7kDSNNyoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11101273491394889667", "cites_id": ["11101273491394889667"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...192.6907M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w4cNYWylD5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1}}
