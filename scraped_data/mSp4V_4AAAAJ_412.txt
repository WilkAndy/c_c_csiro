This offers to space science (X-ray, sub-millimetre and gamma ray astronomy) high energy resolution detectors. We describe the continuing development of space refrigerators capable of cooling to 0.1 and 0.01 K, in particular, the cryogen free refrigerators which offer light weight, long life operation, enabling them to be considered for future small satellites."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:02qyplpeh24C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12784023085544404412", "cites_id": ["12784023085544404412"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168900295011285", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vHVEfkP5abEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1}}
