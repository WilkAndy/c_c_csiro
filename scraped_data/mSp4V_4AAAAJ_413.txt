The test bed is a scaled model of a small hybrid motor which has recently undergone (hot-fire) tests at MSFC. The test section is installed in a dual closed-loop water flow facility, originally developed in 1990 to investigate fluid flow through porous materials. Oxidizer, or mainstream flow, is simulated by a water stream entering through injector slots located in the forward section of the\" motor\"; this flow may be injected either axially (along the motor axis) or radially. Fuel grain\" burning\"(mass injection only) is simulated by a secondary water stream entering the test section through 100| i sintered bronze porous plate material. The test section side walls are constructed of clear acrylic for flow visualization and optical velocity measurements.
