The data set comprises images taken at three phase angles (3.7 (deg), 33.8 (deg), and 57.4 (deg)), through three FUV filters (B6: 130--170 nm, B1: 135--170 nm, and B5: 150--175 nm), for four exposure times each (ranging from 1.3 s for the shortest full Moon B1 exposure to 105s for the longest 57.4 (deg)-phase B5 exposure). Although a very difficult target to track (due to the combined 0.5''/s proper motion of the Moon and the 0--4''/s parallax motion from the shuttle), the apparent resolution of the images is< 5'', or about 10 km on the lunar surface. Since UV emissions from the Moon are due entirely to reflected sunlight, the FUV images will provide useful new data on the ultraviolet scattering properties of lunar soils as a function of phase angle.
