For this reason, there is a clear need to systematically examine the implications of such changes prior to the procurement of new systems. This paper presents the Workplace Analysis methodology developed jointly by the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation and WS Atkins to address these complex issues. The methodology reflects the need to understand and document information flows both inside and between control rooms, the task environment and a full range of workload and organisational issues. The findings of such analysis then forms a solid foundation for the development of the technical specification for control room equipment, staff facilities, manning levels and organisational structure. The paper highlights the benefits derived by MTRC in using this technique to re-engineer the process and facilities within both Central and Station Control Rooms. The use on-dimensional CAD modelling techniques to illustrate proposed console and control room design concepts is also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:pmngxq2mVgoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3733505772102920866", "cites_id": ["3733505772102920866"], "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/1492684", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oqoQAbgT0DMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1}}
