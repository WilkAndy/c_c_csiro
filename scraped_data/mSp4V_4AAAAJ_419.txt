While tumor target volume definitions for malignant gliomas are often based on CT and conventional MRI, the functional imaging modalities, echo planar r CBV (regional cerebral blood volume mapping) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, are more sensitive modalities for the detection of neovascularization, perhaps one of the earliest signs of glial tumor initiation and progression. Methods: In order to address the clinical utility of functional imaging in radiation therapy 3-D treatment planning, we compared tumor target volume definitions and overall dosimetry in patients either undergoing co-registration of conventional Gadolinium-enhanced MRI, or co-registration of functional imaging modalities, prior to radiation therapy 3-D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:jYy9R3AkpWgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10584269140389330368", "cites_id": ["10584269140389330368"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=213426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wP0IkLTg4pIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
