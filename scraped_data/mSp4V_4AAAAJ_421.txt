One of the most salient features of stuttering, as reported by stutterers and clinicians, is that speech production is unusually \u201ceffortful,\u201d or involves high levels of \u201ctension.\u201d Such observations generated two hypotheses:(I) muscle activity is excessive during stuttering, and (2) antagonist muscles are inappropriately co-activated, thus \u201cblocking\u201d ongoing speech. Early studies seemed to support these hypotheses. The present report reviews evidence from recent studies of activity or orofacial, laryngeal, and respiratory muscles. These studies indicated that EMG amplitude does not follow a predictable pattern in stuttering. Indeed activity in some muscles appears to be \u201cturned off\u201d during disfluency. Furthermore, it is now clear that co-activation of muscles with antagonistic functions is the normal mode of muscle activation in speech. These recent studies have revealed abnormal timing of muscle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:fiIBURKaxcoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16133756508275416464", "cites_id": ["16133756508275416464"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16133756508275416464&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kB1nYBCe5t8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
