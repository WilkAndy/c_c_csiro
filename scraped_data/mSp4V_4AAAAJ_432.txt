This centralised system is able to collect bibliographic, field and laboratory soil information from both public and private agencies. Facilities exist in the system to enable data manipulation in word processing, statistical and mapping programs. The system facilitates access to soil data by government authorities, educational institutions and private agencies. More efficient access to soil data and manipulation of that data can improve the use, management, and conservation of our land resource."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Agc8PWtS8JkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13632134967207240643", "cites_id": ["13632134967207240643"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.688599493031204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w6ORyoYSL70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1}}
