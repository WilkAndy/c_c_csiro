There is also a large body of work around harvest strategy development for data-rich fisheries. However, there has been little discussion or specific guidance regarding the process of developing and implementing formal harvest strategies for data-poor fisheries. We outline such a process, illustrated using case studies of data-poor Australian Commonwealth fisheries. The process comprises: (1) compile and review available information; (2) identify possibly indicators; (3) identify reference points for key indicators; (4) select an appropriate harvest strategy and decision rules; (5) if possible, formally evaluate whether the harvest strategy options are likely to achieve the management objectives; and (6) implementation. While this approach is similar to that for data-rich \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8326745506342970717", "cites_id": ["8326745506342970717"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783614002811", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XSWnyOuKjnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
