An n-dimensional polytope (n > 2) is called uniform if it has uniform cells and possesses a symmetry group transitive on the vertices. A polytope is either connected or a compound. If it is a compound we also require the components to be isomorphic and to have no cells of dimension \u2265 n \u2212 1 in common. The connected 3-dimensional uniform polytopes have been investigated by Coxeter, Longuet-Higgins and Miller (1). The convex 4-dimensional polytopes have been investigated by Conway and Guy (2). Compound polytopes have been less extensively described than connected polytopes, but see, for example, (3), (4). Based on 2- and 3-dimensional experience, one might navely conjecture: \u2018given a symmetry group , a uniform polytope P and an integer n, if a uniform compound polytope with symmetry group and consisting of n copies of P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5539748273158959884", "cites_id": ["5539748273158959884"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/two-compounds-of-antiprisms-in-r4/EB789EA78D7605590B04B8DFCB7BD2A1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DDO5HrQj4UwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1}}
