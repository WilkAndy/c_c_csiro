However, we want to know how these different properties are integrated in such a way that they complement each other. For example, why does the nerve not only release noradrenaline but also take it up? Since the nerve can rapidly synthesize noradrenaline, why does it have to store it? That we can now begin to answer these, and related, questions is due not to the application of any one experimental approach but rather to the use of several, chiefly those of the morphologist, biochemist and pharmacologist. The current state of our knowledge about the uptake, storage and release of noradrenaline will show how these properties of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12412643444508426664", "cites_id": ["12412643444508426664"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173834/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qIGBoXKRQqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1}}
