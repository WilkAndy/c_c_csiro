The marked decrease in basicity caused by 6-t-butyl, syn-3-methyl, and syn-3-t-butyl substitution is probably due to steric inhibition of general solvation of the conjugate acid, whereas in the case of the 3,3-dimethyl derivative the effect is offset by inhibition of hydrogen bonding to the free base. For individual compounds differences in rates of quaternisation accompanying a change of solvent may be interpreted in terms of steric effects on hydrogen bonding involving the nitrogen lone pair and methanol."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:bZtZ2VP7DRgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9767643222627482118", "cites_id": ["9767643222627482118"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1971/j2/j29710001201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bnp2gcKjjYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1973": 1}}
