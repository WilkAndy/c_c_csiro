The wife had become confused on the day of admission (19 December 1969) and on arrival was stuporose, hypothermic (rectal temperature 90'F.(32.5'C.)), severely dehydrated, and overbreathing. Femoral pulse rate was 130/min. and brachial artery blood pressure was unrecordable. Generalized rhonchi were heard on auscultation of the chest. Bowel sounds were absent. An immediate ECG showed ventricular tachycardia and, because of this, abnormal potassium metabolism was suspected from the onset. Treatment was commenced with intravenous normal saline and soluble insulin (40 units intravenously, 60 units intramuscularly). The initial blood biochemistry results became available approximately 40 minutes after admission and were: blood glucose 1500 mg./100 ml., serum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:qkvbYSGtNvkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17359093152803991295", "cites_id": ["17359093152803991295"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1819679/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_y7MA0Dj5_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1973": 1}}
