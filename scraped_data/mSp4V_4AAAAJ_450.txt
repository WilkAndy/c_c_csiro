The Karplus relation and conformational theory have been used qualitatively to rationalise the characteristic splitting patterns and coupling involving the ring junction protons, thus distinguishing between alternative conformations.For the syn-series and the 3,3-dimethyl compound it is suggested that the alicyclic ring adopts a rigid shallow boat conformation. The anti-compounds are probably conformationally mobile at probe temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oA8UEeFZdjYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17238531725661068193", "cites_id": ["17238531725661068193"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1970/j2/j29700001161", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oVtUVUWRO-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1973": 1}}
