Our results reveal that this poor information transfer in individual cells is required to increase the information available to cellular populations, so that a single extracellular stimulus can induce graded behavior among an isogenic population of cells. We also show that responses relevant to individual cells (eg chemotaxis) exhibit more reliable information transfer. Thus, noisy signaling is not necessarily a consequence of some inherent physical limitation. Our work provides an explanation for the observed high levels of noise prevalent in certain metazoan signaling networks, and how noise might be exploited by evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:NnTm98qLMbgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5293954209685927583", "cites_id": ["5293954209685927583"], "pub_url": "http://q-bio.org/w/images/b/bd/Qbio2015_48.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n3aDHU7nd0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
