To support these decisions, the use of Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), that is, closed loop simulation\u2010testing of management procedures, is widely regarded as best practice. However, applying MSE is time\u2010 and computationally intensive, and requires highly skilled expertise and processes for stakeholder input and peer review. For data\u2010 and capacity\u2010limited fisheries, MSE may be particularly challenging to implement. Yet, these are the contexts where it is most critical to test assumptions, evaluate the implications of all sources of uncertainty and identify the most informative data sources. To facilitate wider use of MSE, the Method Evaluation and Risk Assessment (MERA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:idgVIVGflKcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12726", "cites_per_year": {}}
