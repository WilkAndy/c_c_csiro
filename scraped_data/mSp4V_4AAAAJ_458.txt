Models adjusted for age, sex, APOE \u03b54 allele count, presence of the APOE \u03b52 allele and all covariate interactions with interval (years from baseline). The outcomes of interest were residual cognitive resilience, quantified from residuals in three cognitive domains (memory, executive function, and language), and combined resilience, summarized as the covariance of educational \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:lcoCQD2fEvcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.067816", "cites_per_year": {}}
