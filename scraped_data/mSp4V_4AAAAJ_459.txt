However, there is a lack of large\u2010scale genetic studies on sex\u2010specific genetic predictors of AD\u2010related cognitive outcomes. Thus, we sought to elucidate the sex\u2010specific genetic etiology of memory, executive function, and language performance.This study included six cohorts of cognitive aging (Nmales=7,267, Nfemales=9,518). We applied psychometric approaches to build harmonized memory, executive function, and language composite scores. Next, for all domains, we calculated slopes from the cognitive scores (two or more timepoints) with linear mixed effects models. Then we performed sex\u2010stratified and sex\u2010interaction GWAS on these phenotypes, covarying for baseline age and the first three genetic principal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:iRxVrxesHjoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.067842", "cites_per_year": {}}
