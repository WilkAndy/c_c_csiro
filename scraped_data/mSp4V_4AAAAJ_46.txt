We extend methods for Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) to assess diverse bycatch species in a multi-sector and multi-gear fishery. We develop methods for estimating fishing mortality rate, based on limited data, for demersal trawl, Danish seine, gillnet, and longline. The general approach involves estimating spatial overlap between species distribution and fishing effort distribution, catchability resulting from probability of encountering the gear and size-dependent selectivity, and post-capture mortality. We define three reference points (Fmsm, Flim, and Fcrash) and use six methods to derive these reference points. As an example, we apply this method to nearly 500 fish species caught in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13868110293083020625", "cites_id": ["13868110293083020625"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783610002481", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ud0mzdVsdcAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
