Previous meta-analyses have demonstrated a PH prevalence of 38% in ESRD, and prevalence of 13-50% in selected pre-kidney transplant cohorts. There is conflicting evidence on the role of kidney transplantation in PH patients, with some data showing improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics following transplant while others suggesting that pre-transplant PH is a predictor of delayed graft function (DGF) and mortality. The 2012 AHA/ACCF guidelines recommend screening for PH in kidney transplant candidates and evaluating for the underlying cause, such as heart failure or lung disease (Class IIa, Level C evidence). Currently, there are no consensus guidelines that outline the risk of renal transplantation in this population.
