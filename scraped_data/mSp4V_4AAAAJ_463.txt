It forms part of a wider Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded two-year research project \u2018WatPop: Understanding seasonal population change\u2019undertaken by the Universities of Plymouth and Leeds in conjunction with South West Water (SWW).The research reported here explicitly sought to address ONS\u2019needs in relation to the development of innovative methods suitable for use in the production of official statistics. We use anonymised dwelling-level water consumption data (collected pre COVID-19, at a 15-minute temporal resolution) to infer dwelling occupancy characteristics associated with tourism. Specifically, we develop analytic approaches which can i) Infer occupancy patterns for tourist dwellings, and; ii) distinguish those tourist dwellings from residential dwellings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:aVFGzZBxbVcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/189680/7/WatPop-ONS_Report_Oct2022.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
