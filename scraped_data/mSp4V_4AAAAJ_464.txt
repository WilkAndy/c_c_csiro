However, sex\u2010stratified models have not been routinely incorporated into genetic studies of cognitive performance or decline. We sought to identify sex\u2010specific genetic predictors of memory performance in aging adults.We obtained harmonized memory scores from 11,601 females and 8,885 males from 7 cohorts of cognitive aging. We calculated scores using latent variable modeling techniques anchored on overlapping neuropsychological test items across datasets to perform both sex\u2010stratified and sex\u2010interaction genome\u2010wide association studies in each cohort using mixed\u2010effects regression models to assess genetic associations with baseline memory score and rate of memory decline.
