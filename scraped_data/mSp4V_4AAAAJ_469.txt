Considering the risk of cell leakage and death after IA injection, MSCs encapsulation in cytoprotective hydrogel appears as a promising solution to overcome these limitations and to provide MSC with a suitable 3D microenvironment supporting their biological activity. In this context, the aims of this work were (i) to generate alginate-based microparticles compatible with IA injection, using a micro-molding technique,(ii) to assess the in vitro viability and bioactivity of human MSCs encapsulated in alginate microparticles, and (iii) to evaluate the anti-OA efficacy of microencapsulated human MSCs in a post-traumatic OA rabbit model.Methods: Human adipose stromal cells (hASCs) were encapsulated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:q7xreA_uRSAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(21)00152-7/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
