Lipidomics has allowed for unprecedented characterisation of the lipidome within biological systems. To explore the lipid dysregulation associated with AD, we utilised our expanded lipidomics platform, examining 569 lipid species across 32 lipid classes, and applied it to the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.We examined over 4000 samples between the AIBL and ADNI studies. Baseline samples comprises of 1112 and 804 from the AIBL and ADNI respectively. Univariate associations between lipids and AD were examined using logistic or linear regressions accounting for variables including anthropometric measures and APOE genotype. Cox regression analysis was used to identify \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oPUkQJkTkUUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.042275", "cites_per_year": {}}
