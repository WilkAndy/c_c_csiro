We know relatively little about how extreme discharges vary in space during flood events, and the limited knowledge that we do have comes from a small number of densely gauged regions in north America and Europe. As a result, the nature of flood footprints in many parts of the world is completely uncharacterized. We address this question in this paper using a novel hybrid of global hydrological model output and regional flood frequency relationships based on global data sets. We show the efficacy of modelled river discharge reanalyses in the characterization of flood spatial dependence in the absence of a dense stream gauge network. While global hydrological models may have limited skill in simulating absolute observed river flows, we find that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:C85SAqxdp5kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMH014...05B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
