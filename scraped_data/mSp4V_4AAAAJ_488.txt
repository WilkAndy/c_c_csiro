These workshops come in a variety of forms, and they are called by many names, including shared machine shops, hackerspaces, fab labs, digital studios and many other labels\u2013including makerspace, which we will use as an umbrella term to keep things simple. What they have in common, however, is a commitment to providing people with the skills and means needed to access versatile design and fabrication technologies, and to fostering communities that share an open and collaborative ethos regarding the possibilities that democratized design and fabrication technologies might offer personally, socially, economically and culturally. In this chapter, we discuss the diverse dynamics of makerspaces, and how encounters between makerspaces and institutional interests in particular are shaping what is possible. We also ask what is gained from the radical redistribution of prototyping capabilities in societies that makerspaces represent, and what is diminished. Makerspace communities engage with a versatile selection of design and fabrication tools\u2013frequently with special emphasis on digital tools for fabrication, in which code and designs are shared over networks, but also including more traditional hand and craft tools as well, that enable people to engage in material participation, pursue new livelihoods, and simply have fun making cool projects (O\u2019Donovan & Smith, 2020). Tools are maintained and accessed through peer networks of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ZewOqPiu9w8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kit-Kat-Braybrooke/publication/348309758_Makerspaces_and_Peer_Production_Spaces_of_Possibility_Tension_Post-Automation_or_Liberation/links/602fa985299bf1cc26d67e51/Makerspaces-and-Peer-Production-Spaces-of-Possibility-Tension-Post-Automation-or-Liberation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4bG8UyKKyhcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
