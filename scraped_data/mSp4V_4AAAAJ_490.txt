Patients undergoing radiotherapy for cancer treatments in the UK receive a dose that is traceable to these devices. In the case of hadron radiotherapy, reducing the uncertainty of these measurements requires the addition of spatial information to understand not only the integral dose delivered, but where the energy is deposited locally. The PRaVDA consortium developed strip detectors able to track individual protons at low rates for proton computed tomography. For calorimetry at clinical dose rates only real-time spot location is required, which could be projected to reconstruct a 2D visualisation from which the beam centre can be determined. This work reports on a proof-of-concept trial carried out using 6 MV X-rays using an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator.
