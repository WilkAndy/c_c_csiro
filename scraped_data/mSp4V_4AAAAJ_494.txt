Following optimisation, high diastereo-and enantioselectivity was observed for \u03b2-lactone formation using C 2 F 5-and C 4 F 9-substituted ketones at room temperature (26 examples, up to> 95: 5 dr and> 99: 1 er), whilst\u201378 C was necessary for optimal dr and er with CF 3-substituted ketones (11 examples, up to> 95: 5 dr and> 99: 1 er). Derivatisation of the \u03b2-lactones through ring-opening, as well as a two-step conversion to give perfluoroalkyl-substituted oxetanes, is demonstrated without loss of stereochemical integrity. Density functional theory computations, alongside 13 C natural abundance KIE studies, have been used to probe the reaction mechanism with a concerted asynchronous [2+ 2]-cycloaddition pathway favoured over a stepwise aldol\u2013lactonisation process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:HG5mk1ZgfbgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/31360423", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mPx8U-PnsegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
