Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) ability to secrete anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory factors represents an attractive tool in the treatment of OA. Considering cell death and the risk of cell leakage upon intra-articular (IA) injection, MSC encapsulation could therefore protect cells from death, avoid cell effusion outside the articular space, and provide a suitable 3D microenvironment supporting the biological activity of MSC. Previously, we have demonstrated that alginate particles, obtained through a dropwise method, support MSC viability and bioactivity. Nevertheless, these particles remained too large (1.5\u00b10.2 mm of diameter) to be injected into the joint space of small animals. In this work, we developed a method of cell encapsulation compatible with intra-articular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ZxKF_jVbApcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(19)30484-4/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
