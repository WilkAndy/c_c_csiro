The effects of line fishing simulator (ELFSim) incorporates a spatially-structured model of the life-history of common coral trout, including larval dispersal, harvest by multiple fishing sectors (commercial, charter and recreational), and a range of mechanisms for regulating harvest. The model is designed to allow considerable flexibility in biological and fishery dynamics, to be portable to contexts other than the GBR, and to be modular to allow comparison of different implementations of biological and harvest model components. In this paper, we describe the details of the model and discuss its utility as a tool for evaluating fishery management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1816008029845471863", "cites_id": ["1816008029845471863"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380007001238", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d0IyeK7BMxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 10, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
