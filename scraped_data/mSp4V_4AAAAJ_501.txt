Often parties with different skills, cultures, background, geographical locations, etc., interface both hardware and software resulting in managerial, technical and logistical issues and constraints. Systems Engineering, based on fundamental of Systems Thinking, proposes systematic solutions to capture, manage, maintain and monitor interfaces over the life of a project. However, particularly within Rail project communities, there are still debates between project managers and systems engineers on who is best to own and handle interfaces. A numerical model of the results of a survey describes the likelihood of scenarios in which systems engineers, project managers, both or neither owns and handles Interface Management. Comparisons with similar concept survey describe a trend change in management attitude in Rail sector over a three years period. While there is no complete consensus over Interface Management ownership, it is still of concern that a considerable population of professionals remain unclear about Interface Management, although this appears to have been improving."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:kW5yJ_waugkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/1729965", "cites_per_year": {}}
