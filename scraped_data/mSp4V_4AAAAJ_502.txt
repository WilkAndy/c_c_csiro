To examine the effect of pain and pain management on ED visit rates in decedents with dementia, we conducted a mortality follow-back study of fee-for-service Medicare decedents aged 65+ with dementia enrolled in the National Health and Aging Trends (NHATS) between 2011 and 2014. NHATS data was linked to Medicare claims and Poisson regression was used to model the relationship between pain and ED visits, adjusting for age, gender, and race. 291 NHATS participants with dementia met criteria (mean age 86, 60% female, 80% white). 56% had at least one ED visit in the last month of life.
