Non-acute repetitive microtraumatic injuries are typically related to running and jumping associated with sports. Pain in the tibia or fibula not caused by acute trauma is most often associated with recurrent impact loading. Training errors and inappropriate equipment are often causative factors. In addition lower leg injuries caused by acute trauma that is unrelated to sport may impact the young athlete\u2019s ability to participate in desired activities. The symptom of lower leg pain, particularly when unilateral, must prompt consideration of diagnoses such as benign or malignant neoplasm, acute or chronic infection, and metabolic bone disease. The diagnosis may not be apparent from the history and physical examination alone. If a problem such as neoplasm or infection is found, choosing one particular treatment method over another may allow a young athlete to successfully return to sport sooner. A published algorithm for developing a differential diagnosis for lower leg pain in an adult athlete can generally guide the evaluation of child and adolescent athletes [1].
