There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data\u2010limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data\u2010limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low\u2010cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care.
