In several fisheries, AFMA has adopted a tiered harvest strategy framework that specifies both assessment methods and decision rules appropriate to the extent and quality of information available for each target species. For by-product and bycatch species, AFMA has adopted a risk-based and hierarchical Ecological Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Management (ERA/ERM) framework that identifies higher risk species and prioritizes management responses. With the increase in number and extent of marine spatial closures, whether for conservation or fishery management purposes, there is a need to evaluate the impact of closures on existing assessment methods and rules and, if necessary, modify these methods and rules, or provide new methods that appropriately account for the existence of closures. This project will evaluate and develop assessment methods and a complementary set of meta-rules that can be integrated into the current assessment and management frameworks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:w14XCadsDagC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ross-Daley/publication/331877540_Incorporating_the_effects_of_marine_spatial_closures_in_risk_assessments_and_fisheries_stock_assessments/links/5c918059a6fdccd4602bf061/Incorporating-the-effects-of-marine-spatial-closures-in-risk-assessments-and-fisheries-stock-assessments.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N1BeJ9_QxlYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
