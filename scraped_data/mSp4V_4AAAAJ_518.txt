Considering cell death and the risk of cell leakage upon intra-articular injection, MSCs encapsulation therefore could protect cell from death, avoid cell effusion outside the articular space, and supply a suitable 3D microenvironment supporting the biological activity of MSCs.Our objective was to develop a method of MSC encapsulation compatible with their intra-articular injection through a 26G needle.Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) were encapsulated via a micromolding method. We first manufactured polydimethylsiloxane chips containing 1600 micromolds with a circular shape, 150\u2009\u00b5m in diameter and 100\u2009\u00b5m in depth. For cell encapsulation, a solution of 2% alginate (w/v) containing 3\u2009million of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:AYaE08C4-t8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ard.bmj.com/content/77/Suppl_1/A60.2.abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
