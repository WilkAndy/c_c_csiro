The first concerns the justification of state punishment, the second the moral damage that occurs when a person is violated, and how the resulting damage can be repaired. The first question leads to political theory and a particular legally based moral grammar of wrongdoing and punishment. The second goes in the direction of a different moral psychology involving a grammar of violation, grieving and reconciliation. Retrieving the young Hegel\u2019s analysis takes us in the second direction. It provides a critical vantage-point from which to view the dominant liberal political theory, including Hegel\u2019s own mature position as a founder of retributive theory. The modern theory of state punishment is legitimated by its public association with a moral psychology of violation, which it at the same time suppresses in favour of its own very different moral grammar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:IyMil-iDmu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/153535753.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sbS-NpNVgjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
