This ideology of mental illness is the result of trying to shoehorn psychological distress and difficulties into a medical framework, which is not at all a good fit. Medical/psychiatric treatments applied to this \u2018illness\u2019, have evidently also proven to be a failure due to the unremitting escalation of \u2018mental illness\u20191, 2 (especially depression and anxiety) and a dramatic increase in suicides in Australia. 3Mental health reform efforts have largely failed to challenge the fundamental problems of the current ideology of mental illness, or the effectiveness of the medical/psychiatric means used to \u2018treat\u2019the patients it generates. The fox has been in charge of the henhouse. If suicide prevention and mental health literacy initiatives are to prove effective in the future, it is imperative that we reach beyond the status quo, not only for a fundamentally new approach to how we respond to psychological distress and mental health difficulties, but as well for how we engage in activities promoting suicide prevention, psychological well-being and appropriate mental health literacy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:MIZpzCdxGj0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://malesuicidepreventionaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SA-Advocating-for-a-new-multi-sector-approach-190218.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KtTjMBTY8rEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
