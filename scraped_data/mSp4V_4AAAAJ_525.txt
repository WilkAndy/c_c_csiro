PLATO will carry out high precision un-interrupted photometric monitoring in the visible band of large samples of bright solar-type stars. The primary mission goal is to detect and characterise terrestrial exoplanets and their systems with emphasis on planets orbiting in the habitable zone, this will be achieved using light curves to detect planetary transits. PLATO uses a novel multi-instrument concept consisting of 26 small wide field cameras The 26 cameras are made up of a telescope optical unit, four Teledyne e2v CCD270s mounted on a focal plane array and connected to a set of Front End Electronics (FEE) which provide CCD control and readout. There are 2 fast cameras with high read-out cadence (2.5 s) for magnitude\u223c 4\u20138 stars, being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oC1yQlCKEqoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/12/11/C11035/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uwg_QCSM-1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
