Skin swabs and TEWL measurements were obtained from commonly affected sites of AD both before bath and> 6 hours after first bath.ResultsAmong the first 11 newborns enrolled, the first bath was at 22 (95% CI: 18-28) hours of life. 10%(1/11) pre-bath vs. 27%(3/11) post-bath had TEWL> 9 g/m 2/h. 55%(6/11) had an increase in TEWL following first bath. Coagulase negative staphylococcal species were the dominant skin bacteria cultured on skin before and after bath. Staph aureus was not detected in any babies before or after bath.ConclusionsTEWL trended higher following first bath. Staph aureus was not detected in any subjects before or after bath. These findings support larger investigations of how newborn bathing practices impact newborn skin integrity and commensal skin organisms"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:mqGkWRiPAHEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120617307007", "cites_per_year": {}}
