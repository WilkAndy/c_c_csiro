Given their marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity, sequencing of multiple IC genes is needed to detect the underlying genetic cause and facilitate clinical interventions.ObjectiveWe sought to implement a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based assay for the molecular diagnosis of diverse ICs and assess its diagnostic utility in a large heterogeneous cohort of patients.MethodsWe validated an NGS-based assay that simultaneously analyzes 45 IC genes in a retrospective cohort of 72 individuals, and assessed its diagnostic utility in a prospective cohort of 993 individuals with a clinical diagnosis or suspicion of IC.ResultsThe 45 IC genes were sequenced with high average read depth (\u223c 500X) and 99.78% of the targeted regions were covered at\u2265 20X. All variants were detected in their correct zygosity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:bQ_FJ0O-9tMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.onlinecjc.ca/article/S0828-282X(17)30434-8/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
