For many fisheries there is little chance of conducting formal stock assessments, and indicators of stock status have to be based on changes in measurable quantities such as catch rates and percentiles of the length distribution of the catch. Use of such empirical indicators for management decisions also requires a choice of appropriate reference or trigger levels for the indicators. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to examine the performance of alternative indicators and associated reference points in terms of their ability to correctly identify the biological conditions that they were designed to measure. This study examines the performance of several potential empirical indicators for broadbill swordfish off eastern Australia, taking into account uncertainties in stock \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8107466789725224739", "cites_id": ["8107466789725224739"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf00095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Iz_ZDReCg3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
