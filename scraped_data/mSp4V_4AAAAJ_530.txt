We set out to identify novel genes important for fibrosis of the heart and kidney to better understand disease biology and with the intent of discovering new drug targets. Methods: We collected atrial biopsies from over 200 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and established primary fibroblast cultures from these biopsies. Fibroblasts were studied at baseline and after TGFB1 stimulation using deep RNA sequencing combined with high throughput, high content quantification of fibrogenic phenotypes that included matrix production, proliferation and myofibroblast transdifferentiation. A range of loss-and gain-of-function approaches in vitro were applied using antibody neutralistion, decoy receptors, siRNA and over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ESN8wY4Sm6AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/38/suppl_1/ehx494.2888/4087525", "cites_per_year": {}}
