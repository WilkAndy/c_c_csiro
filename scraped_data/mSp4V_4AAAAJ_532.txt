Posthoc estimates of clearance (CL), central volume of distribution (V1) and bioavailability (F) were derived from the model using Phoenix NLME. Patient dosing, covariate and outcome data were extracted from a general practice database.ResultsThere were 3075 patients: 1751 (56.9%) males and 1324 (43.1%) females; 371 (12.1%) patients had heart failure and one patient was of South Asian ethnicity. There were 149 (4.85%) patients comedicated with proton pump inhibitors, 21 (0.68%) with amiodarone and six (0.20%) with verapamil. Mean (SD)[range] creatinine clearance was 80.7 (38.1)[8 to 402] ml/min; and age was 71.4 (10.7)[20 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:6uOcHTua4cQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918(17)30323-5/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
