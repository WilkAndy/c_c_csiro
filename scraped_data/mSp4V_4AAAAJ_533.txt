Current dosing recommendations are guided by renal function estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. However, laboratories routinely report renal function calculated by CKD-EPI to clinicians who may use this to determine dose.MethodsPatient dosing and covariate data were extracted from a general practice database and renal function was estimated using Cockcroft-Gault and CKD-EPI. These data were matched to national administrative databases (National Pharmaceutical Collection and National Minimum Dataset). Related prescription and clinical data for cerebrovascular accident (CVA), systemic embolism (SE) and haemorrhage were extracted. Weighted kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:N4e_798Z1OgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918(17)30320-X/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
