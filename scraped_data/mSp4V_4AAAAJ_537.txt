Although renewables are often the primary focus of emissions reductions, the role of natural gas in GHG emissions warrants consideration. Gas is \u2018triple A\u2019: affordable, abundant and available. It is also lower in GHG than other fossil fuel alternatives. The future success and price stability of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects is intrinsically linked to the success of natural gas as a bridge fuel to a lower carbon future; although there was initial optimism about the potential of natural gas as a bridge fuel under COP21, further analysis shows that forecast demand for natural gas and LNG in new policy scenarios is likely lower than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:e0LTWoPxLYMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/aj/aj16241", "cites_per_year": {}}
