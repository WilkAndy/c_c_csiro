Fibroblasts are an important cell type involved in wound healing, however their role in DFU pathophysiology is not fully understood. We isolated primary fibroblasts from non-healing DFUs (DFUFs) and evaluated their properties compared to non-diabetic foot fibroblasts on genomic and epigenetic levels. Altered transcriptional/epigenetic profiles in DFUFs revealed impaired cellular migration and proliferation, stimulation of senescence and dysregulated differentiation. Next, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprograming to shift DFUFs to reacquire wound healing functions and healthy miRNA profiles. In response to reprogramming, DFUFs displayed accelerated cell migration and proliferation, along with a reversal of epigenetic, miRNA profiles, including miR-374a-5p expression from induction in DFUFs pre-reprogramming to a suppression in post-reprogrammed fibroblasts. Suppression of miR-374a-5p triggered up-regulation of targets (RPL34, ADAM9) that may contribute to recovered cellular functions. Moreover, reprograming modified DFUF miRNA profile to induce miR-197-3p, which, coupled with a suppression of target gene CAV1, also lead to rescued cell migration upon DFUF reprogramming and subsequent differentiation. Our findings demonstrate effectiveness of an iPSC approach for therapeutic reprogramming, whereby the epigenetic, miRNA profile of healing-incapable fibroblasts may be modified to generate pro-healing cellular phenotype."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ynMK7YCzbcsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/86642544/pdf.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
