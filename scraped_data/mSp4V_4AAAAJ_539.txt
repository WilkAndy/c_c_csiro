Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in deciding which children might have sustained injury as a result of AHT and should receive further investigation. The objective of this study was to compare CPRs in terms of derivation, population, definition of AHT and performance.We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane databases and included validated clinical prediction rules that focused on the detection of AHT in the clinical setting.Our search returned 128 articles and we identified three recently published validated clinical prediction rules that met the inclusion criteria: the Paediatric Brain Injury Research Network (PediBIRN) 4-Variable AHT CPR, the Predicting Abusive Heat Trauma (PredAHT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:RbL5qsNbO_AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adc.bmj.com/content/102/Suppl_1/A35.1.abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
