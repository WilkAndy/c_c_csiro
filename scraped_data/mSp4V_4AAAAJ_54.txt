From 2010 to 2014, 9 workshops had described 204 areas meeting the EBSA criteria in approximately 68% of the world's oceans. The workshops comprised experts nominated by more than 100 governments and a similar number of regional and global non government and intergovernmental organizations, supported by a technical team that collated data and provided mapping expertise. Despite this progress, there is uncertainty about how to use EBSA in Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). We review a suite of the existing MSP, Ecosystem Based Management, fisheries and conservation frameworks to determine their common elements and suggest how they can be synthesized. We propose an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11092958241449521341", "cites_id": ["11092958241449521341"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569115300703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vTDXYb8a8pkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 24, "2020": 13, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
