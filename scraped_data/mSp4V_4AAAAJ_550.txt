Hence, early preoperative detection of MCI could be used to reduce the incidence of POCD. Neurocognitive dysfunction is not routinely assessed in the preoperative period in a formal way. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test may compensate for the lack of neuropsychological test batteries for MCI in surgical patients in a routine preoperative setting. A study was done to determine the efficacy of the MoCA in estimating the prevalence of MCI among elderly elective surgery patients, to determine the proportion of patients with MCI who did not have recorded diagnosis of cognitive impairment, to detect the effect of increasing age on the prevalence of MCI, and to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:DGzKIA18-3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/surveyanesthesiology/fulltext/2017/02000/cognitive_decline_in_the_elderly_after_surgery_and.15.aspx", "cites_per_year": {}}
