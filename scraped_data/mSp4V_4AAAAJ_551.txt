MICs for each isolate were determined using agar dilution against six antibiotics and interpreted using EUCAST breakpoints. Prevalence of Tichs in each cohort was calculated. A point prevalence survey was conducted in CF to review the patients\u2019 clinical progress following PsA isolation.Results: Prevalence of the Tichs strain in PsA was 48%, 76% and 0% in the CF, NCFB and control cohorts respectively. A statistically significant difference in geometric mean MIC was seen between the Tichs and non-Tichs cohorts in CF for ticarcillin (as expected) and temocillin (p= 0.041 and p= 0.036 respectively). A similar trend was observed in NCFB for ticarcillin (p= 0.038) and temocillin (p= 0.067), although statistical significance was not reached for the latter.In CF, the Tichs strain demonstrated lower MICs to all antibiotics tested apart from gentamicin compared to their non-Tichs counterparts. Those who had the Tichs strain in CF had fewer antibiotics (13.9 days versus 23.5 days, Tichs and non-Tichs respectively) although this result was not statistically significant p= 0.202.Conclusion: Our data supports the existence of a Tichs strain of PsA in our CF and NCFB patient populations. This strain correlated with reduced MICs to temocillin in CF, to which PsA would \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:vGVSmY4B7dEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/57426081/APRC-3-128.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s0agFrab1U4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
