Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic pollutants known to cause adverse health effects including endocrine, immune, reproductive and development dysfunction in a variety of vertebrate species. These contaminants are lipid soluble and are known to biomagnify in the pelagic food web. The Seattle Aquarium houses three male river otters, semi-aquatic pisciverous mustelids that in the wild, inhabit the nearshore of Puget Sound. The river otter exhibit is a closed system, and the otters are fed a diet of restaurant quality fish and shellfish. A commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine PBDE levels from fecal samples collected from the group. Overall, fecal concentrations of PBDEs were generally low (with a highest average value of 65 pg/gr dry fecal weight). Fish from the river otter\u2019s diet were also sampled and tested for PBDE exposure. A mixture of the fish liver and muscle tissue resulted in an average value of 135 pg/gr dry weight. This study further validates the use of ELISA kits for measuring PBDE exposure in non-invasively collected river otter feces, and describes potential links between food, environment, and contaminant exposure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:vytXtR8tOLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cedar.wwu.edu/ssec/2016ssec/fate_and_effects_of_pollutants/73/", "cites_per_year": {}}
