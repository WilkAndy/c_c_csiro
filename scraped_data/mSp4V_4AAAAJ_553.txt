Hence, high resolution and reliable predictions and general information about flooding is of high importance to decision making activities and flood relief services. Flood hazard layers associate with given return period flows or with certain flood events at a global scale are needed and those layers should be easily accessible to anyone. This is a challenge primarily because 1) topography data sets (DEM) at high resolution are currently not available everywhere; the finest available globally being 30 m or 90 m (eg SRTM-DEM, and 2) running flood inundation models even at 90 m may be computationally over-expensive. To overcome this challenge we propose to implement a simple and accurate hydrodynamic downscaling method within Google Earth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:v31Zyw-8rt0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.H21A1380S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
