Understanding how the natural CH4 budget has changed in response to changing climate in the past can provide insights on the sensitivity of the natural CH4 emissions to the current anthropogenic warming. Both radioactive and stable CH4 isotopes (\u039414C-CH4, \u03b413C-CH4, and \u03b4D-CH4) from ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica have been used to constrain the past CH4 budget. Among the CH4 isotopes, 14CH4 is unique in its ability to unambiguously distinguish between\" old\" CH4 sources (eg marine clathrate, geologic sources, old permafrost) and\" modern\" CH4 sources (eg tropical and boreal wetlands). During the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 field seasons at Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, we have successfully extracted 12 large volume ice samples across the Last Deglaciation to early Holocene (20ka-8ka BP).
