With no marine reserves and under a constant future effort level equal to that for 1996, the size of the population was reduced and the biomass stabilised at about 40% of pre\u2010exploitation levels. Marine reserves were ineffective at conserving biomass when limited infringement was allowed throughout an entire reserve. When infringement was absent altogether or limited to the edges of reserves, larger marine reserves lead to lower total catches and higher overall biomass. When infringement was limited to reserve edges, a single large closure was more effective at conserving biomass than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7707286782255480351", "cites_id": ["7707286782255480351"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2005.00440.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H75mVn7I9WoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
