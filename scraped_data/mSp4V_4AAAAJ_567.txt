Specifically, this vendor offered session held as part of the Partners in Solutions is also meant to focus on those requirements. This session is being done along with the other two vendors of approved DBT systems in order to cover the machine specific features of those systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:r-XlWH_wwbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.4957596", "cites_per_year": {}}
