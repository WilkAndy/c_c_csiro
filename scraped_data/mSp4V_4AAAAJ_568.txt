To achieve the planning goals while limiting the spinal cord dose, patients are setup using kV cone\u2010beam CT (kV\u2010CBCT) with 6 degree corrections. The kV\u2010CBCT registration with the reference CT is dependent on a user selected region of interest (ROI). The objective of this work is to determine the dosimetric impact of ROI selection.Twenty patients were selected for this study. For each patient, the kV\u2010CBCT was registered to the reference CT using three ROIs including: 1) the external body, 2) a large anatomic region, and 3) a small region focused in the target volume. Following each registration, the aligned CBCTs and contours were input to the treatment planning system for dose evaluation.
