IVD degeneration is conceptualized as the consequence of the nucleus pulposus (NP) cell inability to maintain IVD extracellular matrix homeostasis. Regenerating the NP niche through biomaterial-assisted transplantation of regenerative cells could thus be a promising strategy to address LBP. Interestingly, we recently demonstrated the ability of human adipose derived-stromal cells (ASC) to give rise to nucleus pulposus cells namely the nucleopulpocytes (NPCy) and the ability of ASC-derived NPCy to support the neo-formation of a NP-like tissue when transplanted with a silanized hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Si-HPMC) hydrogel in nude mice subcutis. Before translating this clinically relevant concept from the bench to the bedsides, it is required to address whether supplementing a degenerative NP with ASC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9CX-kz4inKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(16)00866-9/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
