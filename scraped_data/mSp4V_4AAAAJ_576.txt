Linear regression models were used with adjustment for age, height, gender, season of blood draw, smoking status, pack-years, weight and study site. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to combine the cohort-specific 25 (OH) D associations with PFT outcomes. Effect modification of the 25 (OH) D-PFT association by smoking status (current, former, never) was tested in models extended to include interaction terms, followed by meta-analysis.RESULTSMean (SD) level of serum 25 (OH) D was 65 (10) \u03bc\u03b9^ \u0391 across EU and 48 (10) \u03bc\u03b9^ \u0391 across AA populations.
