To evaluate this hypothesis it is useful to ask whether such methane releases happened during past warming events. The two major abrupt warming events of the last deglaciation, Oldest Dryas-B\u00f8lling (OD-B,\u2248 14,500 years ago) and Younger Dryas-Preboreal (YD-PB;\u2248 11,600 years ago), were associated with large (up to 50%) increases in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations. The sources of these large warming-driven CH4 increases remain incompletely understood, with possible contributions from tropical and boreal wetlands, thawing permafrost as well as marine CH4 hydrates. We present a record of 14C of paleoatmospheric CH4 over the YD-PB transition from ancient ice outcropping at Taylor Glacier \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:tDooYoGqw4EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.A23J..01P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
