Increasingly DAC and AZA are being considered for MDS/ AML patients who may be ineligible for more cytotoxic induction regimens. Trials have shown AZA to be clinically favourable, with DAC being used in cases of resistance to AZA. Cellular uptake of DAC and AZA is via the mem- brane transporter hENT1, and subsequent phosphoryla- tion to the hypomethylating metabolite decitabine triphos- phate (DAC-TP) leads to DNA incorporation, covalent binding to and inactivation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Subsequent cell replication cycles result in DNA hypomethylation and potential re-expression of silenced tu- mour suppressor genes. This study aimed to assess the fea- sibility of rapidly detecting DAC-TP to predict subsequent hypomethylation using a previously validated biosensor sensitive to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) (1). Leukaemic cell lines (KG-1a, HL-60, K562) were exposed to physi- ologically-relevant doses of DAC/AZA to assess whether uptake and metabolism to DAC-TP during the initial post- dosing period would predict subsequent cytotoxicity and hypomethylation. Following daily dosing over a 72-hour period HL-60 cells were most susceptible to DAC-induced cytotoxicity. High-resolution melting analysis concurrently performed on extracted DNA following 96 hour incuba- tion indicated hypomethylation at these doses, concurring with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_hb0F9yZ3cgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2709524893673152234&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
