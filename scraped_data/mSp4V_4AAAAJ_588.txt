A Time Resolved Tandem Faraday Cup (TRTF) was designed and built to collect and differentiate protons from heavy ions (HI) produced during TNSA. The TRTF includes a replaceable thickness absorber capable of stopping a range of user-selectable HI emitted from TNSA plasma. HI stop within the primary cup, while less massive particles continue through and deposit their remaining charge in the secondary cup, releasing secondary electrons in the process. The time-resolved beam current generated in each cup will be measured on a fast storage scope in multiple channels. A charge-exchange foil at the TRTF entrance modifies the charge state distribution of HI to a known distribution. Using this distribution and the time of flight of the HI, the total HI current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:IEHkmGLyHGEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015APS..DPPJP2018P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
