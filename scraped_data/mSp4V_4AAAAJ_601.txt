It exerts antiproliferative effects and dose-dependent vascular disruption. A NSCLC xenograft mouse model demonstrated similar BAL27862 tumor exposure (AUC) at the MTD and a sub-MTD dose, with 11-fold higher peak intratumoral levels at the lower dose. Objectives of this first-in-human clinical trial were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and to evaluate PK, PD and anti-tumor activity.Methods: Eligible patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors received BAL101553 as 2-h IV infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (accelerated dose-escalation). Adverse events were assessed by CTCAEv4 grade (G); tumor response was assessed every 2 cycles by RECIST 1.1.Results: 24 pts (12 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:w0odbtu79TwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923753420306967", "cites_per_year": {}}
