Patients may release the limb for clinical examination or washing (Fig 2). The safety pin of the traditional calico\u2013which is not required in the Tooting Tube\u2013may result in iatrogenic injury and inconsistent elevation. Material costs are comparable between the Tooting Tube and traditional triangular calico sling (40p per unit). 4 Calculations are based on a 120cm piece of Eesiban bandage stockinette (EGJ166, NHS Supply Chain) compared with a single piece of triangular calico (EED022, NHS Supply Chain) and a safety pin (VWL004, NHS Supply Chain). Each sling is designed, fitted and tailored for the individual patient. The Tooting tube sling has been used in over 1,000 patients as the sling of choice at the Department of Hand Surgery at St George\u2019s Hospital, London."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:MwoZBvICJOIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publishing.rcseng.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1308/rcsann.2015.97.1.77", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2dDmBhbQ_zUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
