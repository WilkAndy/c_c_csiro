The analyses are based on scenarios for four of the species of this fishery (spotted warehou, tiger flathead, jackass morwong and pink ling). Integrated Analysis was found to perform best out of six potential methods of fisheries stock assessment (Schaefer and Fox production models, age-structured production model, Integrated Analysis, ad hoc tuned VPA and ADAPT) that are, or have been, applied to data for South East Fishery species. However, its performance, particularly for spotted warehou, is nevertheless relatively poor. The sensitivity of estimation ability to many factors including model uncertainty and the extent of observation and process error is examined. Factors that influence estimation performance markedly include: violation of the assumption of no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8313357020034970771", "cites_id": ["8313357020034970771"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF01008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kzQv5in6XnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
