Only 20% of new cases are staged as having disease amenable to curative pancreaticodudenectomy (PD). In these patient outcome remains poor with only 15% 5-year survival. Better disease sub-stratification may allow identification of patients most likely to gain survival benefit from PD. Patient inflammatory response has been linked with overall survival in a number of cancers and so may be useful in sub-stratifying patients considered for PD. We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the prognostic significance of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).Methods: A literature search of Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL was performed using the PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies which analysed the association \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:SzdLQmZCmkwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ejso.com/article/S0748-7983(14)00900-7/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
