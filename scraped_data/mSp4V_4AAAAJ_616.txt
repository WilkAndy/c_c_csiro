We evaluated the use of cfDNA next generation sequencing (NGS) as a multipurpose response biomarker in advanced cancer patients receiving Phase I targeted drugs.Methods: Between 12/2012 and 11/2013, 135 plasma samples from 24 patients with identified mutations in cfDNA and completing at least 2 courses of investigational targeted therapy were sequenced serially during treatment. Targeted NGS was performed on the Ion Torrent PGM platform with a 50-gene panel with a target coverage of at least 500X per amplicon.Results: The mean sequencing coverage across the experiments was 1,685X. Overall, 24 patients with various tumour types receiving inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n = 18), MEK (n = 4), or in combination (n = 2) and others targets (n = 5) were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:f408LfHov48C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092375341953068X", "cites_per_year": {}}
