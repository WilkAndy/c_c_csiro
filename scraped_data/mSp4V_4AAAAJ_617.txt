WBDWI is a magnetic resonance technique with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting bone metastases, allowing quantification of disease volume and assessment of tumor cellularity by assessing apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC). We hypothesized that volume of bony disease, quantified by DWI assessment, is a prognostic biomarker of overall survival in mCRPC.Methods: mCRPC patients with bone metastases and WBDWI performed on a 1.5-T Siemens scanner between Jun-2010 and Jan-2013, prior to starting a new anticancer therapy, were selected. WBDWI and ADC maps were used to delineate volume of bone metastases (VBM) and represent ADC values on histograms. Clinical data were collected and correlated with VBM and ADC histogram variables. Survival (OS) analysis was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:jG_sDXCMgAMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092375341952213X", "cites_per_year": {}}
