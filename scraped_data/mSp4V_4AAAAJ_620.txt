Of particular importance in this domain is the development of models that capture the dynamic interactions between social and economic systems, and marine ecosystems. In February 2013, a workshop jointly organised by the ICES working group on Integrative, Physical-biological and Ecosystem Modelling and researchers attending the\" Mathematics of Bio-economics\" initiative, a contribution to the international event\" Mathematics of Planet Earth 2013\", brought together experts to discuss recent advances and key methodological challenges posed by this field of research. The presentation will provide a brief report of the key points discussed during the workshop, including identification of the research which may help progress both the development of these modelling approaches and their application to actual management decision problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3q5vy9RXY8EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/conference_proceedings_or_journals/1544bq42x", "cites_per_year": {}}
