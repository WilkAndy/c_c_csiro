Michael Ryan Publishing Co.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 3 strengthening or stretching interventions on hip and lower limb active (AROM) and passive (PROM) ranges of movement. Thirty-nine female dance students (17 [+ or-] 0.52 years; 61.7 [+ or-] 8.48 kg; 164.4 [+ or-] 5.49 cm) volunteered. They were randomly divided into three groups: strength training (N= 11); low-intensity stretching (N= 13); and moderate-intensity or high-intensity stretching (N= 11). Four dancers withdrew during the study. All groups carried out a 6-week intervention. The strength training group focused on end of range hip flexor strength; the low-intensity and moderate-intensity stretch groups carried out a series of stretches at 3/10 and 8/10 perceived exertion, respectively. Active range of movement and PROM were measured preintervention and postintervention using 2D video analysis. Repeated measures analysis indicated that although all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:j33aPA1ap8EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA382086406&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=1089313X&p=AONE&sw=w", "cites_per_year": {}}
