BACKGROUND: DSP diagnosis is challenging because nerve conduction studies (NCS) are often normal. Skin biopsy with measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) is the most commonly employed tool in this setting. However, skin biopsy is invasive, and requires a central laboratory exercising rigorous and routine quality control. Sudomotor axons degenerate early in DSP. Measures of sudomotor function such as quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) may have diagnostic utility. Sudoscan is an alternative means of evaluating sudomotor function. A low voltage potential of varying current is applied to electrodes on which the hands and feet are placed. Chloride from sweat glands is extracted producing a current (electrochemical skin conductance - ESC). ESC is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:NXHHamCF4wcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/82/10_Supplement/P7.003.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
