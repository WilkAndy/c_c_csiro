The use of preoperative blood transfusion, exchange transfusions and one volume whole blood exchange transfusion to lower circulating levels of HbS and correct anaemia has been described (1\u20133). Cardiac surgery in this population presents unique problems as hypothermia, the cornerstone of myocardial protection, can cause vasoconstriction, sludging of cells with increased capillary transit time and increased oxygenation extraction, resulting in sickling. In order to assess the mitral valve with some tone still in the papillary muscles, it is our practice to cool to 25 \u00baC on cardiopulmonary bypass and allow the heart to fibrillate and then examine the mitral valve prior to cardioplegic arrest.
