The core surgical clerkship consists of 2 four week rotations. Each medical student undergoes a ward evaluation completed by faculty and senior residents using a 7-point Likert scale assessing medical knowledge, clinical reasoning, data gathering, communication, professionalism, and future performance potential in surgical residency. In addition, students undertake the NBME examination, where performance is recorded as a percentile score adjusted to national standards. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient.ResultsA total of 129 medical students were studied. Scores on the NBME ranged from the 52 nd percentile to the 96 th percentile with an average in the 75 th percentile (\u00b19). Clerkship scores ranged from 3.2 to 7.0 with a mean of 5.7 (\u00b10.8).
