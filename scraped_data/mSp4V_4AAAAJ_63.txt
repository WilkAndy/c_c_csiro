Australian Commonwealth fisheries are managed using a formal harvest strategy policy (HSP) introduced by the federal government in 2007. At the State level, a number of commercial fisheries are also managed under formal harvest strategies, but no overarching policy currently exists to guide their consistent implementation across jurisdictions. There have been 5 years of experience with implementation of the Commonwealth policy across the highly diverse array of commercial fisheries found in Australia. The HSP has an explicit target of maximum economic yield, and an explicit limit set at half the biomass that would support maximum sustainable yield. The policy also specifies an acceptable \u2026Smith, A. D. M., Smith D. C., Haddon, M., Knuckey, I., Sainsbury, K. J., and Sloan, S. 2014.
