Allergen or diluent was inhaled and spirometry was measured for 7 hours after inhalation challenge. Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates and tonsil biopsies were collected at different times following inhalation challenge. B cells and plasma cells were isolated using CD19 and CD138 magnetic beads, respectively (StemCell Technologies), and stained with CD19, CD27, CD38 and CD138 on the surface and IgE and IgG intracellular, to detect IgE and IgG memory B cells, plasmablasts and plasma cells by flow cytometry.ResultsInhaled allergen induced a mean\u00b1SEM fall in FEV1 of 32.8\u00b12.3% and 15.0\u00b12.8% during the early (0-2h) and late (3-7h) responses compared to a fall in FEV1 of 2.5\u00b11.0% and 3.4\u00b11.5%, respectively, following diluent. Plasma cells (CD38++ CD138+) were consistently detected in bone \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Y3Sh7dCAXz0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/ac6ed57b68d618f8d16c5170cfe95381/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=40575", "cites_per_year": {}}
