The magnitude, frequency, and seasonal timing of avalanches are likely to be influenced by climate change over the next century. Here we present spatial and seasonal variability in meteorological forcing of slab avalanches in several mountain ranges in Colorado, and changes in avalanche activity simulated using enhanced GHG concentrations. In particular, the study identifies loading factors (new snow, snow density, wind) and the development of weak layers using observed and modeled inputs. For the development of weak layers (especially depth hoar), the study will assess early season periods of cold temperatures and shallow snowpack, and also utilizes the SNOWPACK model, whose inputs are surface temperature and humidity, accumulated snow, wind, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:e0V1A8vmkmEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.C41B0603W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
