We are currently conducting a study of programme options, including self-collection of specimens and community based access to test kits, that would increase men\u2019s utilisation of screening services.Using peer-incentivized referral, a type of snowball sampling, beginning with men attending an STD clinic in the US, we are interviewing men in the community to determine the optimal combination of programme features that would encourage asymptomatic STD screening. To demonstrate the relevance of these men\u2019s opinions in terms of reaching a high prevalence group, they were tested for STDs at the time of their interview. Urine samples were collected and rectal sampling was offered to all men. STD testing was performed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:BEz2JxMiyrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://sti.bmj.com/content/89/Suppl_1/A171.1.abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
