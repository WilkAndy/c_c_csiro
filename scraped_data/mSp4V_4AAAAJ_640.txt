The presentation describes the results of an analysis undertaken several years ago to examine the trophic impacts of fishing species that are low in the food chain (low trophic level or LTL species) such as krill, anchovy, sardine and mesopelagic species such as lantern fish. The formal report of the study is in Smith et al.(2011). The study was commissioned by the Marine Stewardship Council as part of a process to refine its assessment methods for low trophic level species. This paper briefly describes the results of this study, and comments on the relevance of some of the models used to issues in the management of marine mammals, including whales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8770308492380464939&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
