Both have a physical advantage over photons because of their Bragg peaks, but only heavier ions such as carbon have a potential biological advantage. This has led to the claim that the most important heavy charged particle radiotherapy of the future is more likely to be with heavy ions rather than protons, and this is the premise argued in this debate.Arguments FOR the Proposition include:\u2022 relative to protons, heavier ions exhibit reduced lateral scattering, reduced range straggling, and increased dose to the tumor compared to the entrance dose\u2022 accurate positioning of the Bragg peak can be verified by in vivo measurements with heavier ions but not with protons\u2022 with heavier ions there is increased RBE in the tumor compared to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:GpOSJs1ZbLkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.4815274", "cites_per_year": {}}
