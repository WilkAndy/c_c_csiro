A generic framework for the development of operating models that includes the possibility of technical interactions among species is outlined. The operating model allows for discarding due to fish size, due to lack of quota and because of mismatches in the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) set independently for the species considered. The importance of technical interactions, mismatches in TACs, and the limits placed by constraints on landed catches and fishing effort is demonstrated by a set of illustrative simulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7753550048016391631", "cites_id": ["7753550048016391631"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF01007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z906SLAkmmsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
