These modelled assessments are typically driven by Global and Regional Climate Models (GCM/RCM). However, opinion is divided on how best to proceed, particularly with regards to the feasibility and practicality of using climate model outputs to inform management strategies. Here RCM driven projections of extreme discharges are compared against the uncertainty present in the observed record. The run-off model HBV_light is applied, within the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework, to the Upper Avon catchment in the Midlands of England, in the UK A 48 year observational record of rainfall and discharge was used, with non-behavioural parameter sets being rejected through an evaluation of continuous hydrograph simulation and annual maximum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:lQh10hhnIEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.H51D1383S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
