To ease the user effort of information discovery, well-structured metadata is needed that describes the report's key statements and conclusions and provide for traceable provenance of data sources used. We present an assessment ontology developed to describe terms, concepts and relations required for the NCA metadata. Wherever possible, the assessment ontology reuses terms from well-known ontologies such as Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ujJXPdh5xs4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMIN51C1704Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
