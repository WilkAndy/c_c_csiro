The main objective was to examine the associations between components of the HyperTG waist (TG and waist cut-points derived from two metabolic syndrome definitions) with a continuous metabolic triad score (MTS) calculated as a cumulative z score of fasting insulin, apolipoprotein B and LDL peak particle density in obese youth.Methods: 75 clinically obese boys and girls (standardized body mass index (sBMI) 3.09\u00b10.6 and 3.05\u00b10.59 kg m 2, respectively), aged 8\u201318 years were assessed after acute weight loss, comprising of diet and exercise.Results: There was no association of waist with the MTS, using the MetS waist cut-offs of deFerranti (2004) or Zimmet (2007). Log TG concentration (p< 0.0001) and waist circumference (p= 0.008) were both independent predictors of the MTS, together \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:cybebCj9Au0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(12)00418-2/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
