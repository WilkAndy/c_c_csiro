Better non-invasive diagnostic and surrogate small fiber measures are acutely needed. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) non-invasively images small axons in Bowman9s layer. Nerve fiber number, length, branching and tortuosity are assessed. While CCM is a promising diagnostic and surrogate measure, its reproducibility as not been rigorously examined.Design/Methods: Five normal subjects underwent CCM of each eye using a Heidelberg HRT3 (Rostock module). 5-10 images were collected from Bowman9s layer in standardized locations in the central cornea: central, inferior-nasal, inferior-temporal, superior-nasal, and superior-temporal. Each image was evaluated by two observers using semi \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:eQnq2AToJJIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/78/1_Supplement/P03.203.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
