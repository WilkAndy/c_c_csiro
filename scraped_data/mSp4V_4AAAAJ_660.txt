At present, measurement of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in distal skin samples is a standard method for the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy (DN). However, IENFD measurement is not considered a good indicator for the diagnosis of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a common symptom of early DN.Design/Methods: Skin biopsies were taken from age and sex-matched groups: normal control (n=12), diabetic patients without neuropathy (n=20), diabetic patients with PDN (n=21), and DN patients without pain (n=21). Biopsies were fixed in Zamboni9s solution (2% paraformaldehyde, picric acid) and stained with protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:D-uKCfLt7BgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/78/1_Supplement/IN1-1.004.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
