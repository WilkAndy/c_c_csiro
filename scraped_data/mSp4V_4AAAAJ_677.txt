Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) is an extra-cellular Ig-like domain of the VEGF receptor-1 that is released into the extracellular space and circulation where it inhibits the activities of VEGF. Over-expression of sFlt-1 has been shown to inhibit ovarian tumor growth in gene therapy experiments. The present study tests the hypothesis that exercise can increase sFlt-1 in the circulation of adult women.Material and Methods: 63 African American and Caucasian adult woman volunteers aged 18\u201344 were enrolled into a prospective exercise study. All the participants walked on a treadmill for 30 minutes at a moderate intensity (40-60% heart rate reserve), and oxygen consumption (VO2) was quantified by utilizing a metabolic cart. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after exercise.
