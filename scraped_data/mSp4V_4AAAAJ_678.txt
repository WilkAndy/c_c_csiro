Gender subordination is at the heart of       the book: the forces of globalised economies make women particularly vulnerable. Susser focuses her skills on this disadvantaged HIV-afflicted group. She seeks to explicate the nexus between       the personal and the political, the powerful and the dispossessed, the macroeconomic and the domestic, and exposes how HIV acts as a powerful palimpsest of the troubling divisions of global       human interactions.
