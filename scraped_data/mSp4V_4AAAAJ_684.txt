While a number of studies have investigated factors associated with non-adherence to cART, there has been considerable variability in the findings. In this study we set out to determine which personal, socioeconomic, treatment-related and disease-related factors are independently associated with adherence to ARV in an Australian sample of PLWH.Using data from the HIV futures six survey, an anonymous cross-sectional survey of PLWH conducted in 2009, we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess the association of factors with self-reported difficulty taking ARV. Chi-square and t tests were used for bivariate analysis.
