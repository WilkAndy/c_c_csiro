The combination of an activating agent and the catalyst was crucial to generate an efficient catalytic cycle. To further demonstrate the utility of this process, the authors performed a simple derivatization of the products to obtain indene carboxylates in good yields and high enantioselectivities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:oqUQjtHG81IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0030-1259622", "cites_per_year": {}}
