These comprised CO2, derived from atmospheric methane, frozen back into glass breakseals following measurement for \u03b413C at NIWA. There were three sample sets: 15 from Baring Head, NZ (BHD), collected each ~ 15 days between March and September 2009, 9 from Arrival Heights, Antarctica (SCT), collected each ~ 41 days between February 2008 and January 2009, plus 21 samples taken along a Pacific Ocean voyage from Nelson (NZ) \u2013 Osaka (Japan) in December 2005 (FTW). All samples were measured to better than 1% precision, sufficient to reveal a 14CH4 signal. The BHD set shows significant temporal variation in 14C for baseline air passing over the Southern Ocean, whereas the SCT set shows a lesser variation for Antarctic air. The FTW set covers a S-N transect across the Pacific Ocean, showing the influence of the ITCZ (5\u00b0-10\u00b0 N) and different meteorological conditions on the concentration, \u03b413C and \u039414C of CH4 and demonstrates that CH4 is not well mixed. Graphitisation reactions averaged 32 min with 0.7 mg of Fe, reduced from Fe2O3, as the catalyst. The samples, blanks and standards were measured in two 10 minute blocks; some were measured again to improve statistics. Average 13C4+ currents per microgram of carbon were 13, 4 and 2 nA/\u03bcg for each 10 min block. Similarly-sized targets prepared in the conventional furnace with Fe2O3 gave 8, 5 and 2 nA/\u03bcg for each 10 min block. Graphitisation efficiencies were typically 90- 100% for microfurnace samples, compared with 37-84% for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:MWSB05WFU5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace101.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/4373", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qlro6sJIuKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
