Key to the efficient graphitisation of ultra-small samples is the type of iron catalyst and the effective trapping of water vapour in a \u2018cold finger\u2019 during the reaction. We have developed a simple liquid nitrogen cooling system that enables us to rapidly adjust the cold finger temperature in our laser-heated \u2018microfurnace\u2019, optimised for the graphitisation of microgram-sized carbon samples. This system is used to firstly transfer the CO2 into the microfurnace, to maintain the cold finger at -80\u00b0C for ~ 5 minutes while the CO2 is converted to CO and then at -160\u00b0C for ~ 25 minutes for the remainder of the reaction as the CO is converted to graphite. It comprises a machined aluminium cylinder mounted in the insulated cap of a 600 ml Dewar. The lower end is submerged in liquid nitrogen (LN2). The upper end has a smaller diameter which is wound with an electric heating element and is provided with a thermocouple and a central hole into which the cold finger is inserted. Electrical power to the heater is adjusted by PID control, permitting the cold finger temperature to be adjusted over the range -50\u00b0C to -160\u00b0C at rates of up to 40\u00b0C/min. This simple system uses modest amounts of LN2 (typically < 0.2 L/hr during graphitisation) and is compact and reliable. We have used it to produce over 120 AMS targets containing between 5 and 20 \u03bcg of carbon, with conversion efficiencies for 5 \u03bcg targets of typically 90-100%. We are currently modifying this cooling system for use with our conventional graphitisation reactors.
