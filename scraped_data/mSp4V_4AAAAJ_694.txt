A medical history, physical exam, skin prick testing, and spirometry were performed. Psychosocial function (daily activity, social characteristics, and mental health symptoms [MHS]) was assessed through the standardized OARS questionnaire and analyzed using chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression.RESULTS: Mean age was 68.7\u00b17.2 years; 59 (77%) were female. Mean percent predicted FEV1 at baseline was lower in asthmatics (73.7\u00b121.6%) than controls (90.0\u00b119.1%)(p= 0.0008). The univariate analysis showed the asthma group had worse daily functioning, decreased activity levels, and impaired social support [SS](p< 0.05). After adjusting for gender, race, and comorbidities, physical impairment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 9.7; 95% CI: 3.1-30.8; p= 0.0001) and impaired SS (aOR: 5.1; 95 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:d4tt_xEv1X8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(10)02535-2/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
