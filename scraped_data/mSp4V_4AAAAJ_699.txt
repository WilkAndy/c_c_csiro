Recent outbreaks of pathogenic Phytophthora sp. In the United States and European Union have been linked to internationally-traded nursery plants. A targeted survey was conducted at two wholesale plant nurseries in Western Australia over the course of one year, to identify Phytophthora sp. present in plant stock being sold to retail nurseries. One nursery was accredited with the Nursery and Garden Industry Australia (NGIA) whilst the other was not. Multiple species of Phytophthora were detected at the non-accredited nursery, but none at the accredited nursery. Species included P. cinnamomi and P. multivora. The results suggest that the best management practices suggested by the NGIA are important for maintaining the disease free status of plants sold through nurseries, and preventing the spread of plant pathogens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:m5Mwo8ouzesC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/12058/", "cites_per_year": {}}
