The model helps to explain epidemiological patterns observed in Europe, including the 3 to 5 year cycle in fox populations infected with rabies, threshold densities and average levels of prevalence of infection. We give a quantitative discussion of the possibilities of controlling rabies by culling or vaccinating foxes (or by a mixture of the two)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 619, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1212968812341403772", "cites_id": ["1212968812341403772"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/289765a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fKA8T7VU1RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 6, "1985": 6, "1986": 9, "1987": 2, "1988": 6, "1989": 13, "1990": 6, "1991": 18, "1992": 15, "1993": 12, "1994": 11, "1995": 15, "1996": 10, "1997": 9, "1998": 13, "1999": 14, "2000": 11, "2001": 14, "2002": 19, "2003": 11, "2004": 16, "2005": 11, "2006": 18, "2007": 21, "2008": 26, "2009": 20, "2010": 21, "2011": 15, "2012": 14, "2013": 16, "2014": 24, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 25, "2018": 18, "2019": 22, "2020": 33, "2021": 28, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
