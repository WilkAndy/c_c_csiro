The values of the parameters of an age-and sex-structured population dynamics model are estimated using information on catches, catch rates, the fraction of winter fishery catches consisting of females, and the age-composition and length-frequency of catches. Estimated parameters include virgin biomass, recruitment steepness, annual recruitment anomalies, selectivity, and natural mortality. For the Bayesian assessment, priors were constructed as part of the stock assessment process by a working group involving fishermen, managers, and scientists. The working group also reviewed all data inputs, and determined base-case analyses and sensitivity tests. The latter included sensitivity to weightings on data, levels of historical catches, and the possibility of auto-correlated recruitment anomalies. The results of the Bayesian analyses are used as the basis for risk assessment and evaluation of future harvest strategies for the stock."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=212060158297174504", "cites_id": ["212060158297174504"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/40687/noaa_40687_DS1.pdf#page=259", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6PFQJpdj8QIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 10, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
