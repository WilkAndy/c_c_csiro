The presence of additional chronic conditions such as arthritis can further amplify this risk. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of aquatic exercise, a common exercise medium used for adults with arthritis, and education on fall risk factors in older adults with hip osteoarthritis (OA). Relevance to the Physiotherapy Profession: Determining the best type and delivery of exercise and education for higher fall risk populations assists clinicians in developing effective prevention programs. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine adults, 65 years of age or older with hip OA and at least 1 fall risk factor, were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Aquatic-Education (AE, aquatic exercise 2/week with 1/week group education), Aquatic (A, 2/week aquatic exercise) and Control (C, usual activity). Balance (Berg Balance Scale), falls-efficacy (Activities Balance Confidence Scale), dual task function (Timed Up and Go cognitive), functional performance (chair stands), and walking performance (6 minute walk) were measured pre and post intervention or control period (11 weeks). Analysis: Between group differences in fall risk variables was examined using a general linear multivariate analysis (MANCOVA) using baseline values as co-variates. Results: There was a significant improvement in fall risk factors (p= 0.038) where AE improved in falls-efficacy compared to C and in functional performance compared to A and C. Conclusions: The combination of aquatic exercise and education was effective in improving fall risk factors in older adults \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:5ff8Uq6-ae4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/2890191", "cites_per_year": {}}
