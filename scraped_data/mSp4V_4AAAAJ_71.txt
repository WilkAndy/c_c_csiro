Diverse commercial and recreational fisheries are widespread, and constitute multi-million dollar industries in the region (Driml et al. 1982, Hundloe 1985, Williams & Russ 1991). Although management of fishing in Queensland and adjacent offshore waters is the responsibility of the Queensland Fisheries Management Authority (QFMA)(Offshore Constitutional Settlement 1987; Queensland Fishing Industry Organisation and Marketing Act 1982-89; QLD Fisheries Act 1989, 1993), the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) effectively also manages fishing within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) by virtue of access and activity restrictions manifest in GBR zoning plans (GBR Marine Park Act 1975). Management of fishing, therefore, is shared between the QFMA and the GBRMPA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13005168872520143880", "cites_id": ["13005168872520143880"], "pub_url": "http://rrrc.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Technical-Report-07.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CNSHai-ke7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 8, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
