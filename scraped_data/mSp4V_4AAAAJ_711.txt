Using the NMTR, we identified all incident prostate cancer cases in 2007 that met the following criteria: 1) adenocarcinoma histology 2) malignant behavior and 3) treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP) as a first course of therapy. Three of the authors (SS, CW, and VW) conducted a systematic audit by reviewing all readily available RP pathology reports to verify data accuracy with regard to pathologic staging per prevailing SEER guidelines.RESULTSA total of 426 cases met inclusion criteria. RP pathology reports were readily available for 219 (51%) cases. The remaining 207 cases were excluded because of incomplete data: only needle biopsy report available in 66 cases, and no pathology reports readily available in 141 cases.
