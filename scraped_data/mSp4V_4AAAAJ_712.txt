This is despite the fact that Braverman himself suggested that office-based labour processes were even more suited to the rationalisation of Taylorism than manufacturing processes. Indeed, it is in its historical analysis of the transformation of social relations in the office, from those based on intimacy and trust to something akin to a factory environment of subordination and impersonal discipline, that Labor and Monopoly Capital provided the richest of Braverman\u2019s empirical data. Two key factors that were pertinent to administrative labour processes were highlighted. The first was that office-based labour processes in large capitalist corporations were essentially continuous flow processes requiring a large scale flow of documentation that, with the development of F.W.Taylor\u2019s ideas, lent themselves more easily to the principles of subdivision, time and motion measurement and minute task fragmentation. The second, and with our knowledge of the nature of work in many contemporary call centres Braverman was prescient here, the introduction of computerised automation into the office contained the technological means of deepening the rationalisation of tasks and enhancing management control through computerised surveillance (Bain et al., 2002). Notwithstanding the criticisms that followed in the wake of Braverman\u2019s highly influential thesis - and the emergence of arguments that sought to show a post-Fordist break from the principles of Taylorism - our contention is that the \u2018modern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:NXjrwPNzFTMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/46041/", "cites_per_year": {}}
