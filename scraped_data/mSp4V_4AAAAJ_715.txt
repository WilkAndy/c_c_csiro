The stethoscope  filters the infants heart beat signal and then slows this signal down while maintaining the frequency information. The design consists of a signal processing algorithm running on an embedded processor while receiving a signal from a microphone. It costs $500 and is able to perform 60 examinations before it requires recharging."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:5eHNVgTYnwwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/2129", "cites_per_year": {}}
