The origin of stereocontrol by these nucleophilic catalysts was studied by computational means. C4-a-Alkyl-branched oxazolyl carbonates were demonstrated to undergo the rearrangement with both catalysts (product 2a), expanding the scope of the transformation to this challenging class of substrates.Comment: The Steglich rearrangement, which enables the formation a quaternary stereocenter, is a popular reaction to probe nucleophilic catalysts. By demonstrating the efficiency of isothioureas 3 and 4, Smith and colleagues introduced a new catalytic motif for this transformation (for original work on the isothiourea motif, see: VB Birman, X. Li Org. Lett. 2006, 8, 1351). More importantly, their careful computational studies allowed for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_eaeta6ualoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0029-1218486", "cites_per_year": {}}
