Even though a management strategy may incorporate elements that are intended to make it precautionary, so that it may be deemed precautionary in principle, it does not necessarily follow that it will actually be precautionary in practice. This can arise through deficiencies or uncertainties in any one of the components of the strategy. In this paper, we discuss how the degree of precaution in a management strategy can be assessed quantitatively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3480229962139986361", "cites_id": ["3480229962139986361"], "pub_url": "https://www.fao.org/3/w1238e/W1238E07.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uWkGJrZCTDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
