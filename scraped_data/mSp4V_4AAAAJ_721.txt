Our photometric requirements of 0.5% on color measurements and 1% or better on relative magnitude measurements, under varying observing conditions, pose a particular challenge. We are therefore developing innovative methods combining telescope-camera system throughput calibration with a tunable laser, real-time spectroscopic monitoring of atmospheric extinction and the high redundancy of our observing program. To optimize and validate the calibration scheme, we are pursuing studies on existing telescopes and putting in place a large simulation of instrumental and atmospheric effects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:uwohsRgU7yoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AAS...21540119B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
