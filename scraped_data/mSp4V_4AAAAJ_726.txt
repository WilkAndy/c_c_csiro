After developing a racemic synthesis of the process (eq. 1), the authors investigated the asymmetric version by treating Garner\u2019s aldehyde 1 with phenylhydroxylamine to obtain (R, Z)-N-phenylnitrone 2 in 87% yield (eq. 2) as a single stereoisomer (confirmed by X-ray analysis). Treatment of nitrone 2 with methylphenylketene at room temperature afforded the corresponding oxindole in 85% yield and 87% ee. The reaction was extended to a series of alkyl aryl ketenes; Garner\u2019s aldehyde 1 was recovered in 78\u201387% yield. The proposed mechanism is under study in order to understand the enantioselectivity of this transformation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9nyh0FOz-90C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0029-1218143", "cites_per_year": {}}
