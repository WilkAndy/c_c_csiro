This is a deep, 18< g< 21.85 (extinction corrected), sample aimed at probing in detail the faint end of the broad line active galactic nuclei luminosity distribution at z<= 2.6. The candidate QSOs were selected from SDSS photometry and observed spectroscopically with the 2dF spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This sample covers an area of 191.9 deg2 and contains new spectra of 16326 objects, of which 8764 are QSOs and 7623 are newly discovered [the remainder were previously identified by the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ) and SDSS]. The full QSO sample (including objects previously observed in the SDSS and 2QZ surveys) contains 12702 QSOs. The new 2SLAQ spectroscopic data set also contains 2343 Galactic stars, including 362 white dwarfs, and 2924 narrow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Sx7WuSFExYwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009yCat..73920019C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
