Resulting rates of parasitism per fruit were measured at the end of each period.  2 For both periods, corresponding to high and low mean numbers of adult parasites, there was a significant positive regresssion of adult wasps per fruit on the number of available hosts per fruit. However, there was a high level of variability about the regression, and the overall aggregative response appears to be weak.  3 For both periods, rates of parasitism per fruit were independent of host density per fruit and they showed a high level of variability at all densities. Similar patterns were found in another, commercial, orchard over a wide range of mean host densities.  4 There was no evidence for aggregation of parasites or density dependence of parasitism at a patch size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7085609483456733511", "cites_id": ["7085609483456733511"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1986.tb00321.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R-GTtkgkVWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 3, "1990": 6, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
