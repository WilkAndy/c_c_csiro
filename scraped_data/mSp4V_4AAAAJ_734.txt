A complete medical history, physical examination, skin prick testing (SPT), spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurements were performed. Quality of life was assessed through the standardized SF-36v2 questionnaire. Quality of life score, spirometry, ENO, and aeroallergen sensitization differences were compared using chi square and two-tailed t-test methods.RESULTS: The mean age of the 58 patients evaluated was 69.8\u00b17.7 years, with 43 (78%) being female. There was a higher rate of SPT positivity in patients with asthma (16 of 18) compared to controls (20 of 40)(p= 0.007). The mean percent predicted FEV1 at baseline was lower in the asthma group (73.7\u00b121.9%) compared to controls (89.6\u00b119.1%)(p= 0.007).
