Of the women in our sample, 23% were totally pain free, and most of the chronic pelvic pain reported was mild. A parallel study showed that men also suffered chronic pelvic pain\u2014a smaller proportion than women, but still significant. 2 We are not medicalising normal events; rather, we are alerting general practitioners to the normal range of pelvic pain experience to help them assess its clinical significance. A GP who says to a female patient \u201cit\u2019s normal, love, just grin and bear it\u201d denies the psychosocial complexity of her experience."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:LOUAI8Maf04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2009/190/1/prevalence-and-correlates-three-types-pelvic-pain-nationally-representative-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_wuNtI-uuvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
