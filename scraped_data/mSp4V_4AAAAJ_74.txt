Fisheries and marine ecosystems constitute a difficult application of this bio\u2010economic challenge. Many experts and scientists advocate an ecosystem approach to manage marine socio\u2010ecosystems for their sustainability and resilience. However, the ways by which to operationalize ecosystem\u2010based fisheries management (EBFM) remain poorly specified. We propose a specific methodological framework\u2014viability modelling\u2014to do so. We show how viability modelling can be applied using four contrasted case\u2010studies: two small\u2010scale fisheries in South America and Pacific and two larger\u2010scale fisheries in Europe and Australia. The four fisheries are analysed using the same modelling framework, structured around a set \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7436240550486343074", "cites_id": ["7436240550486343074"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12224", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ov0XvGHVMmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 14, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
