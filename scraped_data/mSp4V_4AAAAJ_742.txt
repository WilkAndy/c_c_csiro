Both the input and the output are primarily a relatively small molecule, such as an amino acid or an amine. The latter comprises the \u2018monoamines,\u2019 of which dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are the most prominent. Much is known about the release of these monoamines: where and how they are released, as well as the conditions under which that release occurs. This knowledge comes in part by analogy with the more tractable peripheral nervous system, partly from inferences from approaches such as electrophysiology, and partly from biochemical approaches. The latter can be divided into three major categories: (1) in vivo voltammetry; (2) the physical collection of sample, followed by chromatographic separation and detection (usually via electrochemistry); and (3) the imaging of the amount of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:IX653JsL2_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14825198429173632998&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
