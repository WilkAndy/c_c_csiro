The model for the first time links resource movement and fisher behaviour, an approach lacking in most current individualbased models employed to examine CPUE-abundance relationships. For each resource movement scenario, namely (a) random movements between locations;(b) habitat attraction;(c) habitat attraction+ density dependence; and (d) environmental conditions, RESFIM simulates daily resource dynamics and behaviour of fishers harvesting the resource, the latter using a Bayesian belief network (BBN) which determines where fishers will harvest. The decision on where to harvest is based on factors that include information sharing, use of acoustics and environmental conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=90ce79bbeff52e8b9cda7712326487e32d4190f0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7sidWUI5fUYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
