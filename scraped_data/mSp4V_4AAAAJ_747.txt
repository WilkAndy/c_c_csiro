Horizontal winds are measured by TIDI and are calculated from SABER temperature measurements. The SABER derivation of tidal wind depends on the damping and, therefore, the discrepancy between TIDI and SABER determinations of the wind tides can be used to determine the damping. For example, the amplitude of diurnal tide of the meridional wind exhibits very obvious asymmetries between the northern and southern hemispheres. The estimated vertical diffusion coefficient is that which gives the best agreement between the SABER and TIDI diurnal tide winds. The results show that there can be very large diffusion coefficients in very narrow vertical regions. The peak of the diffusion coefficient is at higher altitude in summer than in winter in both hemispheres. The derived diffusion coefficients \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:-GalPxRzH2oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFMSA54A..02X/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
