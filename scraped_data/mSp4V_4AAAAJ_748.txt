However, such carbonate melts may have a great diversity of composition and a mantle or recycled origin remains unclear. Here we present the evidence for unique carbonate metasomatism of the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) beneath the extended southeast margin of the South China block from severely replaced spinel peridotite xenoliths from Mafu, northwestern Taiwan. The metasomatic calcitic carbonates and whole carbonated xenoliths from Mafu have unusually low trace element abundances (total REE abundance< 6 ppm), except for enrichment in Sr, Ba, Pb, Mn and LREE. A magmatic origin is suggested by textural observation that the chromium diopside is resorbed by carbonate melts. In addition, the carbonate melts are distinguishable from the overlaying Miocene limestone and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:eG7oJ4UONFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.V43B2161S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
