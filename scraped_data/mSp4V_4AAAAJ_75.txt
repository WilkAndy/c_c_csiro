However, capitalizing on these opportunities presents significant challenges and a multi-sectoral, integrated approach to managing marine socio-ecological systems will be required to achieve the full benefits projected for the blue economy. Integrated ecosystem assessments have been identified as the best means of delivering the information upon which marine resource management decisions can be made. By their nature, these assessments are inter-disciplinary, but to date have mostly focused on the natural sciences. Inclusion of human dimensions into integrated ecosystem assessments has been lagging, but is fundamental. Here we report on a Symposium, and the articles emmanating from it that are included in this Theme Set, that address how to more effectively include human \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:uQdrZ3qaPmcC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6893170773191798512", "cites_id": ["6893170773191798512"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/7/1947/4210357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8K4z8Et2qV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
