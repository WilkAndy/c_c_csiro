The study aimed to identify teaching methods used at the college to be competitive in the distance education and higher education market. The approach was qualitative. Eight participants were purposefully selected and interviewed by means of an interview schedule that focused on management and teaching methods in particular. Information was also collected on quality assurance and cooperation between BHC and other higher education institutions. The results illustrated the influences of institutional growth and progress, maintenance, management structure and leadership, quality control, collaboration and communication. Regarding teaching methods, the advantages and disadvantages of distance education and face-to-face methods were illuminated. Participants also described a number of innovative teaching methods used. From the aforementioned, recommendations were made for surviving the competitive higher education market."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:CqsiOOvXZmUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43164804.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:11srPBAg6v0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
