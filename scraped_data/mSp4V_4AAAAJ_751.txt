We performed updated meta-analyses of these topics that include more recent studies and incorporate the impact of exposure misclassification, outcome misclassification, and the healthy worker effect.Methods:Following a thorough literature review, meta-analyses of the current epidemiologic literature on benzene and NHL and on formaldehyde and leukemia were performed using the inverse-variance weighting method with adjustments of variance for heterogeneity. A meta-analysis of refinery work and NHL was also performed since benzene exposure has been historically associated with this industry. Several studies on these topics presented relative risks (RR) for different exposure groups \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:D8wXzuvKacYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2008/11001/Updated_Meta_Analyses_of_Benzene_and_NHL_and_of.891.aspx", "cites_per_year": {}}
