There are currently over 25 institutions worldwide treating patients with proton beams and over 55,000 patients have been treated. There are at least 25 new facilities in various stages of planning and building. However, the fraction of patients treated with protons each year remains extremely small compared to the total number of cancer patients treated with external beam photons and electrons. The advantage of proton beams lies primarily in their excellent dose localization as compared to that which can be achieved using photon beams. Due to the Bragg peak characteristic in the depth dose of proton beams, the integral dose from proton therapy is, in general, about two times less that that for photon treatments. This allows higher \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KUgzLixe4cAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.2962331", "cites_per_year": {}}
