We examined the association between post- diagnosis BD and risk of all causes of death and breast cancer death in breast cancer survivors. Methods: Prospective observational study of 524 women enrolled in the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 1998 and followed until death or September 2004. We collected a mammogram and prognostic, demographic, and lifestyle factors including measured weight and height during a clinic visit two to three years after diagnosis. Mammograms were digitized and the cranio-caudal view contralateral to the breast diagnosed with breast cancer was measured for percent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:18X6PRg5UAMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2008.26.15_suppl.22095", "cites_per_year": {}}
