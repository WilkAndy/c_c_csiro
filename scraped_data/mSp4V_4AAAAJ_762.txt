We searched Medline (1996 on), EMBASE (1974 on), CENTRAL, CINAHL, LILACS and ISI Web of Science, handsearched 8 journals and abstract supplements of 3 major international anaesthesia conferences and contacted leading researchers in the field.Results and Discussion: We identified 10 full reports of RCTs, including 735 patients. Blocks studied were brachial plexus (6),\u20183-in-1\u2019(2), femoral (1) and sciatic (1). Comparisons were US vs. peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS)(6), US+ PNS vs. PNS alone (3)-one trial being in both groups-, US vs. surface landmarks (1) and US vs. transarterial technique (1). Our outcomes include insertion time, onset time, block duration, volume of local \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:RVqaWcrwK10C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/ejanaesthesiology/Fulltext/2008/05001/Systematic_review_of_the_effectiveness_and_safety.352.aspx", "cites_per_year": {}}
