They have been performed in a Distict General hospital by a single surgeon. All the knees had an intact anterior cruciate ligament, a correctable varus deformity and the lateral compartment was uninvolved or had minor osteoarthritic changes. At review 29 knees were in patients who had died and 106 were in those who were still living. The mean elapsed time since operation was 5.82 years (range 2\u201312 yrs).Using revision as the end point the outcome for every knee was established. Five knees have been revised, giving a cumulative prosthetic survival rate at ten years of 94.04% (95% confidence interval 84.0 to 97.8). The causes for revision were aseptic loosening in three, progressive valgus deformity in one and dislocation of the bearing in one.
