The topic is critical to public health decision making concerning silica, classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen since 1997, if silicosis is required to increase lung cancer risks, then the goal should be to prevent silicosis; but if it is not required, then lung cancer risks may be increased at much lower doses of silica not known to cause detectable silicosis.Material and Methods:In order to explore significant discrepancies between studies, and to ultimately decide which, if any, study results could be aggregated in meaningful summary estimates, we calculated fixed-effects summaries and random-effects summaries and their respective 95% confidence intervals and also adopted a regression approach.
