The authors discuss Australian research with West African immigrant communities in Western Australia as an example of active community participation in HIV prevention research, which is a key principle of best practice models for HIV prevention in migrant populations.This editorial reviews what is currently known about the practice of oral sex, particularly among young people. It discusses recent studies and provides data from a study of Australian secondary students and the Australian Longitudinal Study of Health and Relationships conducted with people between 16 and 64 years. It contextualises this knowledge within changing sexual contexts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:43B52WW2E64C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sh/shv5n4toc", "cites_per_year": {}}
