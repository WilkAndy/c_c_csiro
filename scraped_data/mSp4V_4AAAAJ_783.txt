Mortality rate ratios (RRs) between Region II and Region V were estimated by Poisson regression.Results:Mortality from acute myocardial infarction in Region II increased within a year or so of commencement of the highest arsenic drinking water concentrations, reached a peak in the period 5 to 15 years after high exposures commenced, and started to decline a year or so after the peak exposures declined. The highest RRs were for young adult men aged 30 to 49 who were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KaRcLhEUy5UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/epidem/_layouts/15/oaks.journals/downloadpdf.aspx?an=00001648-200709001-00563", "cites_per_year": {}}
