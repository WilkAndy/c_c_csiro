This sensitivity to structural assumptions warns us about possible mistakes that can arise in much more complex and realistic models, where we have to make equivalent assumptions. Recruitment limitation implies risk of depensatory impact on forage species as fishing rate on these species increases, with attendant risk of development of predator-prey cycles and strong responses to relatively small changes in basic forage fish productivity due to environmental factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11593227111565383271", "cites_id": ["11593227111565383271"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380016302587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z1ZIaaJq46AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 17, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
