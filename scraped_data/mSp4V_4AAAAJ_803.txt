DNA samples were genotyped for IL4 C-589T and IL13 C-1112T polymorphisms. The relationship of ETS exposure and genotype with the outcome of wheezing without a cold was analyzed with multiple logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.RESULTS: The mean age of infants at time of SPT was 13.4\u00b12.2 months. The overall prevalence of sensitization was 28.6%. The overall prevalence of wheezing without a cold was 26.2%. Analysis of the genotypes was stratified by race since the racially diverse study population was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
