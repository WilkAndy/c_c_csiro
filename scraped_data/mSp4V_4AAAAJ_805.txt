Erratic changes in the flux of radiation belt electrons in response to geomagnetic activity suggest that acceleration is often countered by profuse loss. To predict flux variations both processes must eventually be quantified. Here we identify relevant loss mechanisms by analyzing times when losses overwhelmingly dominate, causing electron flux to decrease dramatically. Recent work suggests that scattering into the atmosphere may be responsible for such flux depletions [Green et al., 2004]. We compare flux measurements from high and low altitude satellites to confirm whether the electron flux observed precipitating into the atmosphere can account for the flux decreases observed at high altitudes. We identify the waves or scattering mechanisms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:ULSBFf147LAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFMSM32A..01G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
