A new US regulatory standard for drinking water InAs in public water of 10-ug/L has recently taken effect, but this does not apply to private domestic wells. According to the USGS, 15% of the US population (approximately 45 million people) receive drinking water from private domestic wells. Reverse osmosis water filtration units are commonly used by owners of private domestic wells to reduce arsenic concentrations, but may not always reduce arsenic concentrations to safe levels. Several reports have evaluated the effectiveness of reverse osmosis filtration units in laboratory settings. However, because of poor maintenance, improper use, limited lifespan, or other issues, the effectiveness of these filters in real-life situations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:aXQ7jtEqGowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/epidem/_layouts/15/oaks.journals/downloadpdf.aspx?an=00001648-200611001-00863", "cites_per_year": {}}
