Because potting foams are routinely used to mitigate shock and vibration of encapsulated components in electro/mechanical systems, accurate material models for foams are needed. A viscoplastic foam constitutive model has been developed to represent the large nonlinear and rate dependent crush of a polyurethane foam throughout an application space defined by temperature, strain rate and strain levels. Validation of this viscoplastic model, which is implemented in the transient dynamic Presto finite element code, is being achieved by modeling and testing a series of structural geometries of increasing complexity that have been designed to ensure sensitivity to material parameters. Both experimental and analytical uncertainties are being quantified to ensure fair assessment of model validity. Quantitative model validation metrics are being developed to provide a means of comparing analytical model predictions with experimental observations. This paper focuses on model validation of foam/component behavior over a wide temperature, strain rate, and strain level range using a Presto viscoplastic finite element model. Experiments include simple foam/component test articles crushed in a series of drop table tests. Material variations of density have been included. A double blind validation process is described that brings together test data with model predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:9fSugHr6AN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1266207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WjxMs1_uGJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
