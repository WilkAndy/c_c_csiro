However, stock depletion is extremely difficult to estimate, particularly with limited data. Using the RAM Legacy database, we developed a boosted regression tree (BRT) model to correlate depletion with a range of predictors calculated from catch data, making the model usable for many fisheries worldwide. The most important predictors were found to be catch trends obtained from linear regressions of scaled catch on time, including regression coefficients for the whole catch time series, the subseries before and after the maximum catch, and in recent years. Eight predictors explain about 80% of variation in depletion. There is a correlation of .5 between measured levels of depletion and the predictions of the BRT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:3vbIHxFL9FgC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1346936068172176371", "cites_id": ["1346936068172176371"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:81uQtjdHsRIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
