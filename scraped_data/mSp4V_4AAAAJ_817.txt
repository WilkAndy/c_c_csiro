DA was confirmed or excluded by specific inhalation challenge (SIC) testing. Multiple logistic regression with DA as the outcome variate was performed with covariates of age, gender, atopy, smoking status, methacholine PC 20 and specific isocyanate exposure: hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI).RESULTS: Sixty six workers (46%) had positive SIC (DA) and 78 (54%) had a negative challenge (non-DA). HDI exposure was reported in 69% of cases. Mean age was 43 years old. In the multiple logistic regression, HDI exposure, as compared to other diisocyanates was inversely associated with DA (odds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:lPDSu1ZU3VAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(05)03782-6/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
