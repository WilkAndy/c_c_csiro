Controlled experimental manipulations of fishing effort is likely to be the best mechanism for empirically assessing the responses of targeted stocks, other reef organisms, and fishing practices to changes in fishing pressure. Line fishing is a major extractive industry on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, which is a mosaic of nearly 3000 separate reefs spread over 15\u00b0 of latitude and has high conservation value. Computer simulations of the population dynamics of the main target species, the common coral trout Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), based on recent field research were used to evaluate various designs for a large\u2010scale experiment to examine aspects of the effects of line fishing in this region.
