Following a pre-implementation audit, a protocol for the use of procalcitonin testing in intensive care was introduced. 2 A prospective re-audit was undertaken to assess adherence, and to review whether PCT testing in our practice improved antibiotic stewardship, inferred prognostication, or aided in the diagnosis and treatment of infection in intensive care, as has been suggested. 3, 4 Prospective data was collected from 50 patients undergoing a total of 111 PCT tests (range 1-7 tests per patient) within the intensive care units of the Trust between January and March 2014 (39 \u2018medical\u2019, 10 \u2018surgical\u2019, and one major burns patient). Each procalcitonin result was analysed against the protocol with regards to timing of the test and decisions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:t13vp6B-Zw8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606495/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UorQ_tWAEJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
