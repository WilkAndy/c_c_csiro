Lessons learned in building VSPO include:(a) A very close and highly interactive collaboration between scientists and information technologists in the definition and development of services is essential.(b) Constructing a Data Model acceptable to a broad community is very important but very difficult. Variations in usage are inevitable and must be dealt with through translations; this is especially true for the description of variables within data products.(c) Higher-order queries (searches based on events, positions, comparisons of measurements, etc.) are possible, and have been implemented in various systems; currently we see these as being separate from the basic data finding and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:eceui-4FXK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFMIN23C..02C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
