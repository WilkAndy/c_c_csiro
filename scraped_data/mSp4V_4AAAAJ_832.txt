Near the mesopause the excited OH states are produced directly from the reaction of atomic hydrogen and ozone. Measurements of emission from these states can be used to derive the density of atomic hydrogen in the airglow layer of this region. SABER is now providing measurements of atomic hydrogen continuously, night and day. In this paper we review the derivation of the atomic hydrogen from SABER measurements and compare results with photochemical model calculations. The uncertainty of the H abundance due to the non-LTE rate coefficients used in the analysis of the OH airglow is also assessed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_elGeoH1qXkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFMSA33A..02M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
