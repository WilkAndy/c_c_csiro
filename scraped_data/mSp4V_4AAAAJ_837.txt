These wide-field, 40\u2032 in diameter, high spatial resolution, 2-3\u2033, UIT UV images reveal a rich field of luminous UV-bright stars, clusters, and associations. There are 181 stars brighter than m2558A=16.5 and 197 stars brighter than m1615A=16.4 within 3' diameter of the 30 Doradus central cluster. We have derived UV fluxes emitted from the 30 Doradus central cluster and from its UV bright core, R136. The region within 5\" of R136 produces \u223d 14% of the far-UV flux (\u03bb = 1892 \u00c5) and \u223d 16% of the near-UV flux (\u03bb = 2558 \u00c5) emitted from the 3\u2032 diameter central cluster. The derived UV luminosity of R136 at 1892 \u00c5 is only 7.8 times that of the nearby 06-7 Iaf star, R139, and the M1892-MV colors of R136 are similar to other 0 or Wolf-Rayet stars in the same region.
