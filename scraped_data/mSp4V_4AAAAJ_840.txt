Self-report screening instruments are disappointing in detecting CP needing specialist intervention for PsyD, and CP with increased PsyD below psychiatric disorder, needing support within cancer care. Items assessing PsyD may fit on a single scale, so we may reduce the number of items CP must answer and tailor questions to CP own level of PsyD. We aim to apply Rasch analyses to instruments measuring PsyD, to develop a bank of items, and to evaluate how these items fit a unidimensional scale across the range of severity of PsyD (in logits). Methods A Rasch common-item equating analysis was applied to our database.
