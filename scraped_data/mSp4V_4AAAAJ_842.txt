Emission directly from ozone at 9.6 microns is observed as is emission from the singlet delta metastable state of molecular oxygen at 1.27 microns, the latter formed directly by ozone photolysis and hence a direct proxy for the ozone concentration. Both the ozone and singlet oxygen emissions are in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) in the mesosphere. There is also substantial non-LTE emission from processes not related to ozone to be accounted for in analyzing each emission feature during the retrieval of the ozone concentration. In this paper we present an overview of the two SABER measurement techniques and we compare the ozone \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:NQc3cRXltbQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUSMSA34A..02M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
