We built a spatially explicit biological and economic model of the fishery to analyze the trade\u2010offs between maintaining given levels of fish biomass and the net financial returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results of the scenarios we modeled suggested that a decrease in total allowable catch at high levels of harvest either increased net returns or lowered them only slightly, but increased biomass by up to 10% for a wide range of reserve sizes and an increase in the reserve area from none to 16 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1535634652662090206", "cites_id": ["1535634652662090206"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01590.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3km0mJSrTxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
