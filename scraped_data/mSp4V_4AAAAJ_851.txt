ORANGE ROUGHY Orange roughy is a long-lived species with a maximum age of over 100 years. It is distributed throughout the temperate regions of the world's oceans at depths of 450 to 1 800 m (Branch 2001). They form dense spawning and non-spawning aggregations on topographical features such as seamounts, but are also widely distributed at low densities in other areas. Commercial fishing for orange roughy first began in New Zealand in 1979 and now trawl fisheries for orange roughy occur in Australia, New Zealand, the North-East Atlantic, Namibia and Chile, as well as on the high seas (Branch 2001)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:X-U7Zakj1o4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iWcTsC2LQ1cC&oi=fnd&pg=PA259&dq=info:-YiiQqUZIqAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ohVk9uJdk2&sig=bzyzSGjf9EYhQlEr-UAwpp0GEAM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-YiiQqUZIqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
