Their results are derived using a definition of \u2018overfished\u2019 that is not consistent with internationally accepted definitions and interpretations. In addition, the authors used unrealistic estimates of biomass that produce Maximum Sustainable Yields (BMSY) obtained through methods that are inconsistent with the approach used by the management agencies and scientific advisory bodies responsible for the stocks in question. Analyses such as that published by Froese and Proelss are an important part of the external, independent scrutiny of the programme that MSC welcomes. However there are a number of serious flaws in their analysis, data and resulting conclusions that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14247936689897772328", "cites_id": ["14247936689897772328"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X12001625", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KJWcP-7WusUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
