He wrote in a wide range of disciplines: moral philosophy, jurisprudence, rhetoric and literature, and the history of science. He was one of the leading figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith also studied the social forces giving rise to competition, trade, and markets. While professor of logic, and later professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow University, he also had the opportunity to travel to France, where he met Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay and the physiocrats; he had friends in business and the government, and drew broadly on his observations of life as well as careful statistical work summarizing his findings in tabular form. He is viewed as the founder of modern economic thought, and his work inspires economists to this day. The economic phrase for which he is most famous, the\" invisible hand\" of economic incentives, was only one of his many contributions to the modern-day teaching of economics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:h9G0ZmjYpDoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://competitionandappropriation.pre.ss.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/95/1970/01/WN1-4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SCGdXHZcUhQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
