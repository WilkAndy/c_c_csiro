The SMEI differential photometry specification is 0.1% for each 1 square degree sky bin, and was designed to provide precise photometric white light images over most of the sky on each 102-minute Earth orbit in order to map heliospheric structures. One of the brightest contaminant signals observed in SMEI is zodiacal light brightness that must be modeled and subtracted from the data in order to provide heliospheric sky maps free from large background changes. We have devised a technique to remove zodiacal dust brightness from the SMEI maps, and in order to do so accurately measure the asymmetry of the equatorial dust to the ecliptic plane as well as the Gegenschein brightness throughout the year. We present preliminary analyses of these observations for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:nlmsuG0oqtYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AGUFMSH21A0398S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
