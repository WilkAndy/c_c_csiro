They do so, however, using quite different approaches, emphases and styles. Macarov is primarily concerned with the outcomes of public (welfare) policies\u2013poverty; Farnsworth\u2019s emphasis is on corporate power and its effects on the processes by which social policies are formulated and the content of those policies. Both authors\u2019 primary focus lies with specific national contexts (the US in the case of Macarov; Britain in the case of Farnsworth), but attempt to contextualise these countries\u2019 experiences. Macarov does so by \u2018snapshot reporting\u2019on various aspects of social policy and poverty in a wide range of countries (though no country or policy field is ever discussed at any length\u2013or indeed for more than a few sentences).
