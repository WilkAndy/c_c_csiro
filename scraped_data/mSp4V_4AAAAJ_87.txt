Spatial variability, either in the population dynamics, fishery operations, or in data collection, has the potential to impact HCR performance as this can drive variability in indicators used for stock assessment. A management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach was used to evaluate the performance of HCRs for blue eye trevalla (Hyperoglyphe antarctica), a species that exhibits spatial variability in monitoring data in southeast Australia. Employing catch curve analysis, the HCRs rely solely on information from the age structure of the catch. Several versions of the HCRs were tested, varying the reference points used to determine management actions, and the way spatial variability was accounted for when setting catch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12485998244131313096", "cites_id": ["12485998244131313096"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783611001640", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yBWZ1z8tR60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
