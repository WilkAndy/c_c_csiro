Recent statistics indicate that 18 percent of the world\u2019s fisheries are overexploited and a further 10 percent are significantly depleted (FAO 2002). Deepwater fisheries seem particularly prone to a boom and bust cycle (Miller 1999, Moore 1999). Overfishing does not seem to be limited by the stage of a country\u2019s development, the political system or the level of scientific advice. Indeed many examples of overfishing have occurred in the world\u2019s most developed countries under the auspices of well-established management structures and in spite of high standards of stock assessment. One of the core reasons why we have often failed to manage fisheries for sustainability is uncertainty. It is the objective of this paper to examine how scientific uncertainty and mistakes in judgement, combined with management and implementation shortcomings, led to the decline of the Australian orange roughy fisheries, and in particular the Eastern Zone fishery. This is not to suggest that this fishery is a unique example of uncertainty and mistaken judgement. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that similar shortcomings do not exist in the management of all fisheries, other natural resources and any endeavor where humans are required to predict future events and their part in controlling it."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3354875301298955570", "cites_id": ["3354875301298955570"], "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/288211.pdf#page=277", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MuWnx0_pji4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
