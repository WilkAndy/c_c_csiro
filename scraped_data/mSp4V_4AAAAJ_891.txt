Therefore, careful laboratory tests will be required to ensure that the detectors and associated electronics are capable of meeting this specification and others derived from the science requirements. Such testing will be required throughout the definition, implementation and mission phases. Initially, tests on preliminary CCDs will be performed to confirm their suitability. During the implementation phase, tests will be necessary on the various instrument models to verify the performance of CCDs and electronics combined. During the mission phase, further lab tests will be needed using flight-representative hardware to understand the performance of the flight instrument in flight conditions. To this end, MSSL is developing a suitable test bench to support these activities.
