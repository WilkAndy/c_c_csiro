T.(Australia). 91", "pages": "91", "abstract": "The governance arrangements for fisheries management are based in use of spatial structures and management measures, such as jurisdictional boundaries, management plans and zoning of fishing type and intensity. There is growing interest in assessing the relative roles of different spatial components in achieving desired outcomes for marine systems as a whole. This includes the use of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the management of fisheries and the ecosystem. The aims of this paper were to consider the effectiveness of spatial-based management for fisheries and the implications for fisheries of closures initiated by other sectors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:w2Gke83ceDMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2102486187506301199&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
