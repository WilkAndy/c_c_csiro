In some applications, the emitter may be located remotely at some distance from the main unit. Typical examples are dashboard-mounted automotive indicators and industrial optosensors. In critical applications, one may require some means of monitoring the integrity of the light emitting diode. Using just four transistors and six resistors, this circuit provides switchable, constant current drive for a light emitting diode and indicates both open-and short-circuit fault conditions. Control signal V CONT switches the light emitting diode on and off. When V CONT is high, Q 1 and the light emitting diode are off. Operation at lower voltages is possible as long as Q 1 has adequate headroom to stay out of saturation, but aware of problems if one uses a blue or a white light emitting diode, because these devices \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:KD63RgGzVVoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=8462704", "cites_per_year": {}}
