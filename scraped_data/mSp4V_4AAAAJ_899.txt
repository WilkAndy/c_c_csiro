Acute pain due to hemorrhage may be difficult to distinguish from more common causes of pain in these patients. This article describes a small case\u2010series of patients who presented acutely with hemarthroses, spinal hemorrhage or muscle hematomas while receiving anticoagulant treatment.Methods: Case notes of nine patients were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic characteristics, indication for anticoagulation, international normalized ratio, and management were evaluated.Results: The majority of hemorrhages occurred when the INR was within the therapeutic range. Anticoagulation was held in all cases. Joint aspiration was performed in all cases of hemarthrosis. Surgical intervention was required in management of the spinal epidural bleed and also in one case of muscle hematoma.Conclusion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_09KEOFGu60C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0219-0494.2003.00038.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IfCgN1kKxyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
