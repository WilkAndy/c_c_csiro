A comparison with such processes in other countries, where stakeholder involvement ranges from government scientists only to involvement of scientists, industry and conservation non-government organizations, suggests that Australia is the only country in which fishery managers are active and integral stock-assessment participants. In Australia, as in several other countries, the form of advice is comparative (consequences of alternative decisions) rather than prescriptive.
