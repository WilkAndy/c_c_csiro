To date beryl, quartz and YB66 crystals have been used to access this energy range. With 10 years experience of using these crystal sets on a second generation SR source, a review of their perfomance under operating conditions is presented along with a discussion of prefered future options for accessing this energy range on modern third generation machines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:WMXKS7b3b6oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5995404286933437769&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
