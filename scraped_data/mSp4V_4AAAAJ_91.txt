Using a model system, consisting of an imidazolium-based IL ([C2Mim][NTf2]) in contact with a sapphire substrate, we have approached this problem using a complementary combination of high-resolution X-ray reflectivity measurements and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our strategy enabled us to compare experimental and theoretically calculated reflectivities in a direct manner, thereby critically assessing the applicability of several force-field variants. On the other hand, using the best-matching MD description, we are able to describe the nature of the model IL\u2013solid interface in appreciable detail. More specifically, we find that characteristic interactions between the surface hydroxyl \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:RPh6sY6S0Z0C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8978178810192304538", "cites_id": ["8978178810192304538"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz5024493", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mplzNw_mmHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
