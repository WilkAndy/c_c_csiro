The first suture is placed in the standard fashion, the second suture is inserted with a round bodied needle to avoid damage to the first repair. This is placed at right angles to the first repair and enters the tendon at the furthest point from the cut tendon end. This suture is then tied with the knot on the surface of the tendon, using 4/0 Ti.cron. The repair is completed with a circumferential continuous epitenon suture, using 6/0 Prolene. This method produces a repair with a four-strand core suture and is referred to throughout this paper as the Evans repair.Flexor digitorum profundus tendons harvested from pigs were used as the experimental model. They were divided at the mid-point and then repaired using either a \u2018modified Kessler\u2019 4/0 Ethibond core suture, a \u2018modified Kessler\u2019 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:p866XJ6hu_8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/abs/10.1302/0301-620X.85BSUPP_I.0850025c", "cites_per_year": {}}
