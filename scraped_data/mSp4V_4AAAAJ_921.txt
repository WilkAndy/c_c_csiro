White LEDs are rapidly gaining popularity as sources of illumination, as in LCD backlights, but with forward voltages typically ranging from 3 to 5V, operating them from a single cell presents obvious difficulties. This design exploits the ultralow operating voltage of a single-gate Schmitt inverter. When you first apply battery power, Schottky diode D1 conducts, and the familiar Schmitt-trigger astable multivibrator starts to oscillate at a frequency determined by timing components C2 and R1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:PbrqR9PZhrEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=6417737", "cites_per_year": {}}
