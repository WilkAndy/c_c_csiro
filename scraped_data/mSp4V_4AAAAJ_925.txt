Clinical assessment was carried out using the modified Merle D\u2019Aubigne and Postel (MDP) scoring system and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiological evaluation included measurement of subsidence, bone resorbtion, pedestal formation and implant-bone interface assessment. All live patients were reviewed. The average follow up was 50.3 months in the JRI group and 51.8 months in the Osteonics group.Results: There were eight intra-operative femoral and one medial acetabullar wall fractures in the JRI group.
