Tremolite aggregates were synthesized in the presence of tremolite-saturated 4M HF, with fluid fractions (\u03c6) ranging from 0.03 to 0.22, at 950 C and 1.4 GPa for 120 hours in piston-cylinder apparati. Permeability of the quenched and dried materials was measured at near-atmospheric conditions and scaled to a grain-diameter of 1 mm. At low fluid fractions, the tremolite aggregates were substantially less permeable than synthetic quartzites and marbles produced using a similar technique. Materials with \u03c6 less than 0.04 did not exhibit detectable permeable flow for periods exceeding 168 hours. Above \u03c6= 0.04, the relationship between permeability (k) and porosity is approximated by the following: k= d 2 x (\u03c6-0.04) 3/270. At \u03c6= 0.22, permeability was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:5vmaGNysiqoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUFM.V72B1321P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
