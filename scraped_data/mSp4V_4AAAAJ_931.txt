As the amount of built environment around urban areas has increased, it has been widely recognized that more impervious surface area (ISA) results in greater volume and intensity of stream flow, which can degrade stream health and require expensive modifications to flood control structures. Other effects include increased urban\" heat island\" influences and changes in local weather. If impervious areas could be accurately mapped using satellite imagery, it would provide valuable input to many applications, from hydrologic modeling to land use planning. We have developed a method to map subpixel ISA with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and classification-regression tree algorithms. This approach provides highly accurate (90+ percent) maps of ISA, but also permits estimation of the proportion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:yCjxvIMm6_oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUFM.H72E0905S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
