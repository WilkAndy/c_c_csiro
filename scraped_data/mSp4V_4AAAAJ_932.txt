The derived maps were used to assess riparian zone stream buffer tree cover and to predict, with multivariate logistic regression, stream health ratings across 246 small watersheds averaging 472 km2 in size. Stream health was assessed by state and county experts using a combination of physical measurements (eg, dissolved oxygen) and biological indicators (eg, benthic macroinvertebrates). We found it possible to create highly accurate (90+ per cent) maps of tree and impervious cover using decision tree classifiers, provided extensive field data were available for algorithm training. Impervious surface area was found to be the primary predictor of stream health, followed by tree cover in riparian buffers, and total tree cover within entire watersheds.
