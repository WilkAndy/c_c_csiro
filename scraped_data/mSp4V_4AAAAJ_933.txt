Methods: A total of 79 fresh frozen knees were examined from 45 cadavers Combined anterior and posterior approaches were used to inspect the vicinity of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) for the presence of the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments. The anterior approach utilised a medial parapatellar incision followed by division of the anterior cruciate ligament, whilst a midline posterior arthrotomy was used for the posterior approach. Further dissection facilitated inspection of the meniscal and femoral attachments of the MFLs, and measurement of their lengths. Videos of MFL and PCL motion during passive flexion of the cadaveric were also performed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:vkz5F8TaVKkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://boneandjoint.org.uk/article/10.1302/0301-620X.84BSUPP_III.0840321a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gC3lEtx1exAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
