Using the ANTARES AMS facility at ANSTO we are able to analyse samples containing as few as 10{sup 5} atoms of these radionuclides. Cosmogenic radionuclides produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the upper atmosphere and exposed surface rocks are stored in natural archives. By measuring small variations in the concentrations of these isotopes over time, information can be inferred about the systems governing these changes. Over the last four years we have undertaken a broad range of climate change and environmental studies, based on the ultra-sensitive technique of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Some specific examples of projects investigating the ice sheet at Law Dome, Antarctica and minerals extracted from geological surface formations will be given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Zk83zdSX4-UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20328858", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fODRo_Oc9IQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
