Subject to exclusions, 40 patients undergoing day-case arthroscopy of the knee (mean age 44 years, ASA grade 1\u20132) were randomized into two treatment groups. All patients had general anaesthesia. The trial group received an injection of 15mI 0.5% Bupivicaine / 1/200,000 adrenaline pre-emptively. After surgery a placebo injection was given of 15ml normal saline in an identical manner. The control group received the opposite order. Additional post-operative analgesia, if required, was administered in recovery. This was recorded, also total dose of propofol used, time to awakening, visual analogue pain score at 15 / 30 / 60 minutes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/abs/10.1302/0301-620X.84BSUPP_II.0840158b", "cites_per_year": {}}
