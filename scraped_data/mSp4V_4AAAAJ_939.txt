A detailed non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model was used to perform the inversion of radiances to number densities for individual profiles. The retrieval yields comprehensive data sets of CO 2 and O 3 densities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The CO 2 volume mixing ratio (vmr) in the 70-100~ km region is significantly smaller than obtained from previous rocket borne mass spectrometer data, but is in good agreement with the data obtained by other 4.3~ \u03bc m emission and absorption experiments. The latitudinal variation of CO 2 density is maximum at 100~ km and varies a factor of two from 70 o~ N to the equator \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:YiBZ6_7J9mkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUSMSA21A..12K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
