While numerous types of biological reference points exist (Mace 1994), the most commonly applied are target and limit reference points, usually expressed in terms of either the biomass of the stock or the level of fishing mortality that achieves given outcomes. Limit reference points indicate a point which should be avoided, while the target reference point represents the point that management is aiming to achieve (Mace 1994). While maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the most commonly applied target reference point (Caddy 2004), there is increasing interest in maximum economic yield (MEY) as an alternative target (Dichmont et al 2010). Maximum economic yield represents the level of fishing effort and catch that maximises the level of economic profits in the fishery (see section 2 of this report). As it generally involves a lower level of fishing effort, it is more conservative in terms of biomass than MSY, and as it generally involves a lower level of fishing effort is often considered to be more environmentally beneficial in terms of bycatch and habitat damage (Dichmont et al. 2008; Grafton et al. 2007).The Australian Commonwealth Harvest Strategy policy (DAFF 2007) identifies the level of biomass that achieves MEY (BMEY) as the target reference point for Commonwealth managed fisheries. The estimation of MEY requires an understanding of both the key economic and biological parameters relevant to the fishery. In data poor fisheries, some or all of these parameters may be missing.
