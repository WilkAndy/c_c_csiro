King and MM Esiri, with the aim of studying in parallel a cohort of patients with memory problems and age-matched controls. The total number of subjects at the end of 1999 was 666, of which 361 are patients with dementia. OPTIMA is a longitudinal clinicopathological study and its main strength lies in the very high necropsy rate (94% of the 207 who have died), which permits correlation of findings in life with those of neuropathology. Each year each subject has a full clinical examination, lumbar puncture, neuropsychology (the CAMDEX, supplemented by other tests), CT scans (axial and temporal lobe-orientated) and SPECT scans (Ceretec, for cerebral blood flow). A subset of 155 subjects have had annual volumetric MRI scans and more detailed neuropsychology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/26048/1/409.pdf#page=247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XfBEYL3vXSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
