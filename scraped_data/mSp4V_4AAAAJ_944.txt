We have reported type 2 diabetes in children, defined by evidence of insulin resistance, but the prevalence and characteristics in UK children is unknown. We aimed to characterise and determine the prevalence of non-type 1 diabetes in the UK. The British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Clinical Trials unit undertook a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of all paediatric diabetes centres during 2000, collecting data on presentation, clinical characteristics, and investigations. 177/228 centres responded (75%), and manage 15,255 diabetics under 16 years. They provided data on 113 children with non-type 1 diabetes (0.8%). 25 had type 2 diabetes (0.2%), of whom 8 presented in 2000 (0.4%). 24 had MODY, 45 had diabetes secondary to other conditions, and 19 unknown. We compared type 2 diabetes to type 1 (comparative data from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:_QFUy-i41P4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0003/ea0003P108", "cites_per_year": {}}
