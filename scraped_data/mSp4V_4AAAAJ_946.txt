This enzyme is sensitive to gabaculine (2, 3-dihydro-3-amino benzoic acid) and to 4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid (AFPA), which are irreversible, mechanism-based inhibitors of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. Spontaneous mutants of Synechococcus PCC6301 resistant to these inhibitors contain altered enzyme that displays corresponding resistance to high concentrations of the inhibitor. The enzyme from strain GR6, resistant to both inhibitors, contains a three-amino-acid deletion at positions 5-7 and a Met 248\u2192 Ile substitution. The enzyme from strain K40 resistant to AFPA but not to gabaculine, contains a Ser 163\u2192 Thr substitution.
