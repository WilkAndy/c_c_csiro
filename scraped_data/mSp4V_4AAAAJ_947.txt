These modifications lead to progressive restriction of blood-liver exchanges. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the permeability changes in a model of hepatic fibrosis by using dynamic computed tomography (CT) enhanced with contrast agents of different molecular masses. Dynamic single-section CT of the liver was performed after intravenous bolus administration of a low-molecular-mass contrast agent (iobitridol) and an experimental high-molecular-mass agent (P840) in normal control rabbits and in rabbits with hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic, aortic and portal venous time-density curves were fitted with a dual-input one-compartmental model to calculate the hepatic mean transit time and distribution volume of the contrast agents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:Js6xCJvs_BkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8553678262095194939&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
