For this we use a 3-dimensional chemical model. Simulated ozone in the middle mesosphere changes sharply between day and night, but in addition rises and falls during daylight and during darkness. We present evidence of the changing chemistry responsible for these fluctuations. Contributions from diurnal tides are also included. The model results will be compared with published observations and with TIMED data, if available."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:qdR3duxP4mUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002cosp...34E.696S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
