It allows for the expectation that a fish tagged early in a fishing season has a higher chance of being recaptured during the season than a fish tagged later in the season. The model is applied to the harvested population of Patagonian toothfish at Macquarie Island utilising data from a tag-recapture experiment initiated during the 1995/1996 fishing season. The population models of the assessment include dynamics of tagged and untagged fish, daily releases, catches, recaptures, natural mortality, and annual net recruitment. Two assessment models are presented. The first, referred to as the \u2018length-independent selection\u2019 (LIS) model, assumes the recaptures are Poisson distributed, and the recapture expectations are conditional on catch numbers and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5832989881213041118", "cites_id": ["5832989881213041118"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783603000730", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3rkmeGTx8lAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
