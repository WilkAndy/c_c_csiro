These cells were sparsely cultured to allow the formation of independent colonies. When their colony edges came into contact with one another, their boundaries were examined. Cells expressing identical nectin types did not intermingle at the border, whereas those expressing nectin-1 and-3 mutually invaded the counter colony, resulting in the formation of a mosaic pattern (Fig. 4, A to E, and fig. S6). We also performed time-lapse video microscopy using a coculture of MDCK cells expressing nectin-1 or-3 (N1-and N3-MDCK cells). In the supporting movie (movie S1 and Fig. 4E), one N1-MDCK cell (arrowhead) initially adhered to one of a pair of N3-MDCK cells (asterisks); subsequently, the former cell invaded the space between the two N3-MDCK cells. As a result, N1-and N3-MDCK cells were rearranged into a mosaic pattern. Similar behavior of cells was repeatedly observed in multiple experiments.Thus, we propose that the heterophilic interactions between nectin-1 and-3 are critical for establishing the checkerboard-like pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. The molecular interaction between nectin-1 and-3 is the strongest of all possible combinations of the three nectins, which is likely to be responsible for the checkerboard-like assembly of these cells (Fig. 4F), as predicted by the mathematical model (8). The loss of nectin-3 removed such biased cell-cell adhesion, leading to cell rearrangement, including attachments between hair cells (Fig. 2D), as explained by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mafmc.org/s/Forage_Smithetal2011.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2rgmCbd-1NsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
