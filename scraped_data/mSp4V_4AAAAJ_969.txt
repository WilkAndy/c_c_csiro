From 1996 to1999, commercial scale production has shown that, in the Maritimes, high yields of hybrid seed can be economically produced and that seed quality parameters, including germination, purity, hybridity and seed size met or exceeded expectations (Walker, personal communication). However low seed vigor of NB grown seed rated as low as 15% compared to Western Canada standards which are normally above 85%. Both germination and vigor were reduced as days in the swath increased; in seed lots left more than 10 days in the swath, germination dropped by about 0.4% per day while vigor decreased by about 1.1% per day (Atlin et al., 2000). It is reasonable to believe that the poor drying conditions of this region will require new harvesting techniques. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of three harvest aid treatments on yields and quality of hybrid seed canola harvested at 3 seed moisture level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:DwFgw5hZUzMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ae7dc97b8118da43af09b93b9c0ed14ef0471562", "cites_per_year": {}}
