Given that fisheries range from low to high value, there is a real need to understand how to trade ecological and economic risks, and the various costs associated with their management, against the benefits from catch. Key to this is an understanding of (a) the costs corresponding to a given level of acceptable risk, or conversely, (b) the change in risk given a change in cost investment. This paper first defines biological, economic and ecosystem risk at a whole-of-fishery level, and then develops a simple model to quantify the trade-offs between risk, cost and catch. Using as case studies Australia's federally managed fisheries that range from data-rich to data-poor, risk was quantified for target species in terms of both their limit and target reference \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7716172228922204237", "cites_id": ["7716172228922204237"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X12002503", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TWCkmsJZFWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
