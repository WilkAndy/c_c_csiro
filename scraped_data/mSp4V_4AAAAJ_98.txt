This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta\u2010analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non\u2010parametric methods to assess non\u2010linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet\u2010wide quota limits (94% of stocks had recent catches below or within 10% of quotas), but only 2/3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "mSp4V_4AAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7992893271685992314,7038723087344049816,409878085321966612", "cites_id": ["7992893271685992314", "7038723087344049816", "409878085321966612"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eg90GhV27G4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
