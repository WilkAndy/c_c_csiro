The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is defined here as the proportional change in mean annual streamflow divided by the proportional change in mean annual rainfall. The elasticity is therefore a simple estimate of the sensitivity of long-term streamflow to changes in long-term rainfall, and is particularly useful as an initial estimate of climate change impact in land and water resources projects. The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is estimated here using a hydrological modelling approach and a nonparametric estimator. The results indicate that the rainfall elasticity of streamflow (\u03f5 P ) in Australia is about 2.0\u20133.5 (observed in about 70% of the catchments), that is, a 1% change in mean annual rainfall results in a 2.0\u20133.5% change in mean annual streamflow. The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is strongly correlated to runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 358, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9377686423714855924", "cites_id": ["9377686423714855924"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1623/hysj.51.4.613", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9PuGBB48JIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 16, "2010": 17, "2011": 34, "2012": 31, "2013": 20, "2014": 28, "2015": 22, "2016": 24, "2017": 26, "2018": 25, "2019": 19, "2020": 18, "2021": 31, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
