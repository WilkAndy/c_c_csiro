The models are applied to a large data set across south\u2010eastern Australia to explore the effectiveness of the different model types under varying data availability. The conceptual rainfall\u2010runoff models are relatively simple tools for predicting runoff in catchments and large regions with sufficient observed streamflow data to calibrate the models. In data\u2010poor regions, the simple water balance methods can perform as well as the rainfall\u2010runoff models, particularly where only mean annual runoff estimates for broad\u2010scale assessments are required. Rainfall\u2010runoff modelling is a fairly mature science, and this article provides \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8670021294536591682", "cites_id": ["8670021294536591682"], "pub_url": "https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-8198.2009.00318.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qgntf24aUngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
