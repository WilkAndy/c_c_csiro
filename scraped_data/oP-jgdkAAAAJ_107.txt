The catchments draining to Lake Eyre include large iconic river systems such as Cooper Creek (catchment area 306,000 km2, river length 1500 km) and Diamantina River (catchment area 160,000 km2, river length 1000 km). The LEB covers areas of South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. These areas are largely flat marginal semi-arid to arid zone lands. The vegetation in the Basin reflects the arid and semi-arid conditions, tending to be highly responsive to rainfall variations. The area has a high conservation value as the ecosystems are largely rare and remain relatively intact. Ramsar listed wetlands (Coongie Lakes), grasslands, and arid regions are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15948908760661097476", "cites_id": ["15948908760661097476"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15948908760661097476&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BPxRUgToVd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
