The data indicate that the potential nutrient contribution of stormwater leaf litter (greater than 5 mm) is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the typical nutrient loads in urban stormwater. The results suggest that removing leaf litter from urban waterways will do little to reduce the total stormwater nutrient load.1998 Academic Press"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6767422050187956876", "cites_id": ["6767422050187956876"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479798903346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jFKZ0n-26l0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
