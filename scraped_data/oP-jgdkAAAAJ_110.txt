There is potential to use remotely sensed data for calibrating hydrological models in regions with limited streamflow gauges. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation on how to incorporate gridded remotely sensed evapotranspiration (AET) and water storage data for constraining hydrological model calibration in order to predict daily and monthly runoff in 30 catchments in the Yalong River basin in China. To this end, seven RS data calibration schemes are explored and compared to direct calibration against observed runoff and traditional regionalization using spatial proximity to predict runoff in ungauged catchments. The results show that using bias \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9527725609461579925", "cites_id": ["9527725609461579925"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020wr028205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lYBZNfZHOYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
