The objectives of this study are to compare three methods of applying statistical downscaling to catchment rainfall and evaluating their hydrological response with a hydrological model: (a) statistically downscaling to sites and then interpolating to gridded rainfall which is accumulated to catchment average rainfall; (b) statistically downscaling to catchment average rainfall directly; and (c) statistical downscaling to grid cells and then accumulating to catchment average rainfall. Results indicate that statistical downscaling can be successfully applied at catchment average and grid cell scales. All three methods of application performed similarly for a range of rainfall characteristics, with directly downscaled catchment average rainfall producing a relatively better result for extreme daily rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15166951104711177030", "cites_id": ["15166951104711177030"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169413002655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RjMH-qvVe9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
