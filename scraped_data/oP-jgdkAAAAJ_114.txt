Precipitation, runoff generation at the land surface, infiltration into the subsurface, the uptake from vegetation and consequent transpiration, and evaporation from the soil determine how much water will reach the river. Water movement through various flow paths on the land surface (including the river network), in the unsaturated zone and in the groundwater (Chapter 4) determines the dynamics of the runoff (ie, the hydrograph shape). The hydrograph is the aggregated result of many such processes. It is the most complete runoff signature, but at the same time the most complex to understand. Indeed, all other signatures discussed in the book are technically extracted from the runoff hydrograph by averaging, estimating probabilities or taking extremes of the runoff time series.
