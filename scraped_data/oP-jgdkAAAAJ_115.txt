To evaluate flow resistance relations and sediment transport for landscape vegetation coverage and combinate effect of vegetation patches, field simulated rainfall experiments were conducted using a series of overland runoff and sediment transport rates in 3\u202fm (L)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fm (W) experimental plots with coverages of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 90% in a uniformly distributed condition and composited flow paths of different patches (horizonal path, vertical path, random patches and S-shaped path) in the same coverage (40% and 60%). The runoff rates for the grassland with coverages of 20\u201390% were decreased by 19.3\u201361.4% (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), and the sediment concentrations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7131936181657588430", "cites_id": ["7131936181657588430"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706119301247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ztJ0rCu6-WIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
