Rainfall is the key driver of water resources, where a change in mean annual rainfall in Australia is generally amplified as a two to three times bigger percentage change in mean annual runoff. The future catchment-scale climate series required to drive hydrological models in climate change impact studies is generally informed by the relative global climate model (GCM) simulations for the future and current climates.This paper (i) presents the range of future rainfall projections from the 23 GCMs used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report for three large regions of Australia (south-east Australia, south-west Western Australia and northern Australia),(ii) assesses whether the GCMs can reproduce the observed characteristics of historical annual rainfall, and (iii) explores the implications of GCM selection, assessed against different criteria, on water resources impact studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7053005588217428662", "cites_id": ["7053005588217428662"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a7a39bf48ec427858e2f3670af1263074f3c7d63", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tnqLzDZP4WEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
