To develop practical runoff prediction methods is important for assessing water resources in an ungauged or poorly gauged catchment which is usually located in headwater regions.Regionalisation is typically used for runoff predictions in ungauged catchments. This can be defined as the process of transferring parameter values from a gauged catchment to the target ungauged catchment. This study evaluates three commonly used methods for selecting donor catchments whose entire set of parameter values are used to model runoff in a target ungauged catchment: spatial proximity, physical similarity and integrated similarity. In the physical similarity method, the catchment with the most similar physical characteristics to the target ungauged catchment is chosen as the donor catchment. In the spatial proximity method, the geographically closest gauged catchment to the target ungauged catchment is chosen as the donor catchment. In the integrated similarity method, the spatial proximity and physical similarity measures are considered together to choose the donor catchment. The modelling results are also compared to results from a randomly selected donor catchment. The study also compares results from the use of a single donor catchment versus the output averaging of results from multiple donor catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1955972746408140090", "cites_id": ["1955972746408140090"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongqiang-Zhang-15/publication/291347552_Evaluation_of_regionalisation_methods_for_predicting_runoff_in_ungauged_catchments_in_southeast_Australia/links/56a169dd08ae984c4498e649/Evaluation-of-regionalisation-methods-for-predicting-runoff-in-ungauged-catchments-in-southeast-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Op0AhNkCJRsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
