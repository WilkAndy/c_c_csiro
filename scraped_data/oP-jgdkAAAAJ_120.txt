It describes where climate change projections can be obtained and the sources of uncertainties in the climate change projections, and modelling and data driven methods for estimating the hydrologic sensitivity to climate. The paper presents a simple 'rule of thumb' method for estimating climate change impact on mean annual run-off that can be used, prior to, or in the absence of a more detailed modelling study. The paper then discusses the different methods that can be used to obtain climate change impacted time series data to drive hydrological models to assess the climate change impact on run-off."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9525267750877232649", "cites_id": ["9525267750877232649"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.503642934132177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CX6FaY2MMIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
