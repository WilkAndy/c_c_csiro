Penman's combination equation is generally accepted as an appropriate method for estimating potential evapotranspiration. However, as all the climatic data required to calculate Penman's potential evapotranspiration are seldom available, potential evapotranspiration is more commonly approximated as a factor times standard evaporation pan reading. In this paper, linear regression equations relating Penman's potential evapotranspiration for land surfaces to Class A evaporation pan data over several time periods are developed for various climatic regions throughout Australia. The analyses indicate that the correlations between daily estimates of Penman's potential evapotranspiration and pan data are poor, and therefore, pan data should be treated with caution if used to approximate daily potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2507891161478645293", "cites_id": ["2507891161478645293"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9920101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LcZGV7nRzSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
