This paper describes the use of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to identify oscillations/variability in annual streamflow time series. The EMD method is also applied to bootstrap replicates of the original time series to test the statistical significance of the identified oscillations. The EMD is a relatively new technique and has several advantages over spectral time series analysis techniques. It is also relatively easy to use as the intrinsic oscillations are automatically and adaptively selected from the time series. The EMD analysis is applied to annual streamflow time series from 20 catchments across the world. The results indicate that statistically significant oscillations of 11-14 and 20\u201325 years are observed in some, but not all, of the time series."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3124525082084774774", "cites_id": ["3124525082084774774"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ahJL43MKVOcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA53&dq=info:dhN2-QGLXCsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=RhfgTRQZbf&sig=WP7eAOuv97SPpcVnzseuxonQqx4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dhN2-QGLXCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
