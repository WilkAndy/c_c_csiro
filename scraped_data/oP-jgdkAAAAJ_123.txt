The daily version of the Monash rainfall-runoff model, HYDROLOG, was used as the surface model with potential evapotranspiration estimated from Morton's representation of wet environment evapotranspiration. The surface model was calibrated and tested by comparing the streamflow simulated by the model and the recorded streamflow. Groundwater recharge is an output from the model. Modelling was carried out in both the irrigated and non-irrigated areas of the northern half of the Campaspe River Basin in northern Victoria, Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17789823137256478015,14011281963666118159", "cites_id": ["17789823137256478015", "14011281963666118159"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169490900623", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P5UyieMl4vYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
