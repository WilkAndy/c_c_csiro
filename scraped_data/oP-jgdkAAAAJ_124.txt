Climate input to the models is distributed at~ 25 km2 grid cells and the catchments range in size from 50 to 2000 km2. Each of the models is calibrated on each of the 240 catchments. Each catchment is then simulated using parameters sets calibrated for the nearest neighbouring catchment. Model predictions are assessed using the daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and the volume bias.The results demonstrate that whilst an increasing number of optimisable parameters leads to increased calibration performance (when assessed using metrics based on the sum of squared residuals), the reverse is true for a large proportion of catchments in cross-verification using parameters from one donor catchment. This reversal, however, does not persist for the multi-donor averages, where the more highly parameterised models typically have the best performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12463341702847723887", "cites_id": ["12463341702847723887"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Teng/publication/254441741_Comparison_of_multi-model_and_multi-donor_ensembles_for_regionalisation_of_runoff_generation_using_five_lumped_rainfall-runoff_models/links/552310150cf2f9c130544d32/Comparison-of-multi-model-and-multi-donor-ensembles-for-regionalisation-of-runoff-generation-using-five-lumped-rainfall-runoff-models.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b_mMwD6v9qwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
