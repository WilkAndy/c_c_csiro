The maps give average monthly and annual values of three evapotranspiration (ET) variables: point potential evapotranspiration (PPET), areal potential evapotranspiration (APET) and areal actual evapotranspiration (AAET). This paper compares the average annual and seasonal values of the ET variables in the ET Maps with three commonly used ET variables, using data from 55 locations in Australia. The comparisons indicate that the PPET is similar to class A pan evaporation and can be used as a substitute for class A pan evaporation. The APET is similar to the Priestley-Taylor ET, except in north-east Australia where the APET is about 20% higher than the Priestley-Taylor ET. The APET in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18075206817101020307", "cites_id": ["18075206817101020307"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13241583.2003.11465223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k3wGZ9UI2PoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
