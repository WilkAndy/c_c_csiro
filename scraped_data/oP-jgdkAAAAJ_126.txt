In the first simulation, soil moisture and precipitation intensity are assumed to be uniformly distributed. In the second simulation, precipitation intensity is assumed to be exponentially distributed, and soil moisture subgrid variability is expressed in terms of the variable water\u2010holding capacity of the grid cell. The effect of subgrid variability of precipitation intensity and soil moisture is taken into account to model surface runoff more realistically. National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data with its precipitation estimates adjusted to long\u2010term values are used to drive the land surface scheme, and flow routing is performed to obtain streamflow at three locations in each river basin.
