Models with continuous water balance accounting has the advantage over models with event-based simulation in that dynamic factors affecting runoff production may be represented explicitly. In addition, the design flood estimate need not be associated with specific design storm, instead it is derived directly from continuous rainfall records, or from Monte-Carlo simulation using stochastic rainfall data.Daily rainfall-runoff models can be categorised into three groups: black box, process and conceptual models (Chiew et al. 1993). In the black box approach, empirical functions (eg simple mathematical expressions, time series equations or artificial neural network) are used to relate runoff (output) to rainfall (input), and only the input and output have physical meanings. On the other hand, process models such as Syst\u00e8me Hydrologique Europ\u00e9en (SHE)(Abbott et al. 1986) and Institute of Hydrology Distributed Model (IHDM)(Beven et al. 1987) attempt to simulate, in a spatially distributed manner, the catchment hydrologic processes using partial differential equations governing various physical processes and equations of continuity. While process models are intuitively more precise and/or accurate than the black box models, many parameters need to be calibrated (hence practically prohibitive due to data and resources limitation), and they suffer from scaling problem (in model structure) relating theoretical equations that describe hydrologic processes on small laboratory scales to temporally and spatially heterogeneous catchment (Beven 1989).
