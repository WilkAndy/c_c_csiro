Runoff is simulated using the conceptual daily rainfallrunoff model SIMHYD, and climate change impacted rainfall for 2021-2050 is estimated from the CSIRO Mark 2 GCM simulations. The 2021-2050 rainfall is estimated using a scaling method that considers daily patterns of change simulated by the GCM. The results show a decrease in mean annual rainfall and runoff in eastern and south-west Australia, but an increase in the extreme daily rainfall, in 2021-2050 relative to 1961-1990. The results also indicate that climate change impact simulations from scenarios derived using the daily scaling method are more realistic than simulations using scenarios derived by scaling the historical rainfall by monthly average GCM changes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2126607198401958734", "cites_id": ["2126607198401958734"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39886049/05_Chiew.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TpOJzfo5gx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
