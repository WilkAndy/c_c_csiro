Five statistical tests are applied to the annual streamflow volumes and peak discharges of 142 rivers throughout the world. The analyses indicate that although statistically significant trends and changes are detected by some of the tests at several locations, they are not consistently observed throughout specific regions. As such, there is no clear evidence yet of climate change in the annual streamflow volumes and peak discharges of rivers in the world."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15934995398540945008", "cites_id": ["15934995398540945008"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-5676-9_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cGaEQ-N5JN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
