The simulation of the stream-aquifer interaction was modified to include the modelling of the flow from the river to the aquifer and the simulation of the deep seepage process was modified to allow possible movement of water from the deep aquifer to the shallow aquifer. Comparison of the river recharge and baseflow rates estimated by the 'modified HYDROLOG' model (MODHYDROLOG) with those simulated by an integrated surface and groundwater model indicated that the improved algorithms provide a better representation of the groundwater processes than the algorithms that are currently used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10592409901731268672", "cites_id": ["10592409901731268672"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10592409901731268672&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QMgFRK_M_5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
