Passive microwave observations have been used to infer surface soil moisture information because they are not affected by cloud cover and there is a physical relationship relating emissions to soil water. Remote sensing vegetation cover types and leaf area index time series data have been used as inputs into distributed, semi-distributed and lumped hydrological models (Liu et al., 2007). This paper investigates the potential to improve runoff, soil moisture and vegetation dynamics predictions in ungauged catchments using a land surface hydrological model, AWRA-L, together with remotely sensed leaf area index measurements from NOAA-AVHRR and surface soil moisture measurements from TRMM-TMI. The study is conducted in 579 unregulated catchments across Australia. The AWRA-L model was regionally calibrated (i.e. a single set of parameters optimised) for half the catchments in four experiments: (1) against daily recorded streamflow data (Exp1); (2) against daily recorded streamflow together with monthly NOAAAVHRR leaf area index data (Exp2); (3) against daily recorded streamflow together with daily TRMM-TMI soil moisture data (Exp3); and (4) against all three data sets (Exp4). Next, the four optimised parameter sets obtained from the four regional calibration schemes were applied to the remaining half of the catchments for validation to evaluate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4067784721678591732", "cites_id": ["4067784721678591732"], "pub_url": "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/83232", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9OZp_qasczgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
