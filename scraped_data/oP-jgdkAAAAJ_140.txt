Four small sites (3 to 20 ha) representing residential, commercial and light industrial areas as well as one site at the outlet of the 160 hectare catchment are monitored. Velocity and water depth are measured continuously while during storm events, up to ten personnel collect gross pollution (debris and litter) and water samples which are analysed in the laboratory. Analysis of data from only one event indicates that gross pollution concentrations generally peaked before the hydrograph while higher TSS, TP and TN concentrations during the rising limb of the hydrograph were observed only at one site. The data also showed that more than two thirds of the gross pollution collected were garden debris (leaf litter and twigs) and that higher proportions of paper and plastics came \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12552688593984047436", "cites_id": ["12552688593984047436"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.356090009139346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TEmE7MQbNK4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
