They also overview the physical diversity of the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, with a measure of the abundance and frequency of different river types as an indicator of the condition of large river systems. The authors present details of an aggregated index of the physical condition of rivers with the Murray\u2013Darling Basin. They then expand these concepts of physical assessment to include newer thinking about river resilience and Social\u2010Ecological Systems, and present a framework for including these factors in future assessments of large rivers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16628048554507363824", "cites_id": ["16628048554507363824"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119412632.ch30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8OVbpw-ywuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
