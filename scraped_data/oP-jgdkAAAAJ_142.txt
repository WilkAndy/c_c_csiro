For this purpose, both data- and top-down model-based analyses of the dynamic relation between rainfall and runoff for selected sub-catchments have been undertaken. Data analysis techniques (e.g. trend analysis, deconvolution and baseflow filtering) were used to assess the temporal and spatial variation in the hydrologic response characteristics for each site. The lumped conceptual rainfall\u2013runoff model IHACRES CMD (Catchment Moisture Deficit) version is applied to the sub-catchments to assess the adequacy of the model response in representing the impact of weather patterns on streamflow. Several performance criteria have been used to evaluate the performance of the model in each calibration period using a multi \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4938324675574972298", "cites_id": ["4938324675574972298"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475410001564", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ij8xySB0iEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
