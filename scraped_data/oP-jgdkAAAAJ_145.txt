The simulations indicate that the key surface water and energy quantities estimated by a typical rainfall-runoff model (MODHYDROLOG) and a typical land-surface scheme (BEST) for a wet tropical catchment and a temperate ephemeral catchment are reasonably similar. The results suggest that the parameterisations used in land-surface schemes can simulate runoff satisfactorily for wet areas but are too simplified to model runoff adequately in ephemeral catchments. The simulations also suggest that the simple algorithms used in rainfall-runoff models can be adopted for climate change impact studies and for use with AGCMs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12886549559026721417", "cites_id": ["12886549559026721417"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169495028773", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iSJBTow41rIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
