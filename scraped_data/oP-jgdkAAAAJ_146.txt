That is to say, there could be multiple sets of predictors that give similar daily rainfall simulation results for both calibration and validation periods, but project different amounts (or even directions of change) of rainfall changing in the future. Results indicated that two sets of predictors (Set 1 with predictors of sea level pressure north-south gradient, u-wind at 700 hPa, v-wind at 700 hPa, and specific humidity at 700 hPa and Set 2 with predictors of sea level pressure north-south gradient, u-wind at 700 hPa, v-wind at 700 hPa, and dewpoint temperature depression at 850 hPa) as inputs to the NHMM produced satisfactory results of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8979167370216532905", "cites_id": ["8979167370216532905"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016980951730707X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qeuISCZpnHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
