The results show that the Budyko model can provide reasonable estimates of runoff and is suitable for data limited regions. In regions where there are some streamflow data available, the calibration of a single parameter in the Fu model gives better runoff estimates than the Budyko model and similar to regionalised rainfall-runoff models. In drier regions, the consideration of different vegetation types in the Fu model can improve the modelling results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4216475372639478592", "cites_id": ["4216475372639478592"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.7158/13241583.2012.11465394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QONb9gLugzoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
