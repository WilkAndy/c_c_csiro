The impacts are estimated by comparing the water fluxes simulated by a hydrologic model using present climate data and greenhouse\u2010enhanced climate scenarios predicted by general circulation models. The results indicate that changes in rainfall are amplified in runoff. In wet and temperate catchments the percentage change in runoff is about twice the percentage change in rainfall, whereas in ephemeral catchments with low runoff coefficients the percentage change in runoff can be more than four times the percentage change in rainfall. The modelling study estimates that the annual runoffs in catchments on the northeast coast and east coast of Australia could change by \u22125 to +15% and \u00b115% respectively by the year 2030.
