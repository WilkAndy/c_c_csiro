Over the period 1997\u2212 2006, mean annual rainfall has been approximately 16 percent lower than the long-term (1895\u2212 2006) average across the MDB. Runoff has been 39 percent lower over the same period.The continuing drought in the MDB has brought the need for a thorough understanding of how the current drought compares to the longer-term variability of rainfall and runoff in the MDB. In this paper, we:(1) examine the historical variability of annual rainfall and runoff in the MDB using a statistical \u201cchangedetection\u201d methodology;(2) quantify, in a probabilistic sense, the severity of the recent dry sequence using average recurrence intervals (ARIs); and (3) quantify the hydroclimatic causes of low runoff in the southern MDB, using the Campaspe basin as a representative example, with the lumped conceptual daily rainfallrunoff model SIMHYD and four scenarios of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14210676371007741018", "cites_id": ["14210676371007741018"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e9bd604f0da03e9494a10e68cef462884393ced4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Whz0N952NsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
