Studies across numerous regions have documented the sensitivity of streamflow to climate change using the precipitation elasticity of streamflow, defined as the proportional change in streamflow to a change in precipitation. This study shows that calculating precipitation elasticity of streamflow without first assessing the strength of the precipitation-streamflow relationship can produce misleading and unrealistic results. For example, the Spokane river basin precipitation elasticity of streamflow is 0.90 by using annual precipitation and streamflow accumulated on a January-December calendar year basis. This indicates that a 10% change in annual precipitation would produce an annual streamflow change of 9.0%. However, using water year (Oct-Sep, in this case) precipitation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10015183382776946667", "cites_id": ["10015183382776946667"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP114875&sb=RECENT&n=23&rpp=25&page=2&tr=5007&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:65_QUjkU_YoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
