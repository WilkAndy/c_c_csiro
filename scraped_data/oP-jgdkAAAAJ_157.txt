This paper presents an overview of the relationship between ENSO and Australian rainfall and streamflow using data from 284 catchments throughout Australia. The ENSO-rainfall and ENSO-streamflow teleconnections are investigated by fitting a first harmonic to the 24-month El Ni\u00f1o rainfall and streamflow composites. The potential for forecasting rainfall and streamflow several months ahead is investigated by calculating the lag correlations between rainfall and streamflow versus ENSO indicators and the serial correlations in rainfall and streamflow. The results indicate that El Ni\u00f1o generally leads to dry conditions across Australia in the latter half of the year. The relationship between rainfall and streamflow and the indicators of ENSO is reasonably strong in spring and summer, and can be exploited to forecast rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5640309579514803495", "cites_id": ["5640309579514803495"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13241583.2003.11465216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J3U2zq1nRk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
