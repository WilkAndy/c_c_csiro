It is important to have a clear understanding of the amount of pollutants attached to the different sediment sizes so that treatment facilities can be designed to effectively target the removal of the most polluted sediment sizes. This paper presents results from a study carried out to determine nutrient loads associated with different particle size ranges for dry surface pollutants and stormwater samples collected from an urban road surface. The results indicate that although more that half of the surface pollutant is coarser than 300 \u03bcm (microns), less than 15% of the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) are attached to particle sizes greater than 300 \u03bcm. The pollutant loads in the different particle size ranges from different stormwater samples show a larger variability for TN than for TP.
