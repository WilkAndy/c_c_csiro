Most applications assume the same runoff sensitivity for both an increase and a decrease in precipitation. This study examines this assumption using long historical annual precipitation and streamflow data from 353 watersheds across the United States. The results show that the assumption is acceptable in humid and subhumid regions (aridity index less than 1.0). However, in arid and semiarid regions (aridity index greater than 1.0), the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation is greater for a decrease in precipitation than for an increase in precipitation. Therefore, the use of precipitation elasticity of runoff estimated using the entire data set in semiarid and arid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7397952728059639679", "cites_id": ["7397952728059639679"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JD030129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f3cgZc_OqmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
