Most studies calibrate the rainfall-runoff (RR) models against gauged streamflow data and use regionalisation methods to specify parameter values to model runoff in the ungauged catchments. This study evaluates the relative benefits of different calibration (local and regional) and regionalisation methods (nearest neighbour and regional forest and non-forest parameters). The modelling experiments are carried out using two RR models (Sacramento and SIMHYD) and daily climate and streamflow data for 10 unregulated gauged catchments from southeast Australia.Three sets of model calibrations are carried out. In the first set, the rainfall-runoff models are calibrated to individual catchments. In the second set, spatial land cover information is used to calibrate two sets of rainfall-runoff model parameters (one set for forest and another for non-forest, a total of two calibrated parameter sets for all 10 catchments). In the third set, a cross-verification analysis is carried out where one catchment is dropped out in turn and the models are calibrated to the remaining nine catchments together using forest and non-forest land cover labels for individual grid cells within each catchment (one set for forest and another for non-forest, a total of two calibrated parameter sets for all nine catchments). The calibrated models ability to predict runoff in \u2018ungauged\u2019catchments is then assessed by:(i) using parameter values from the geographically closest gauged catchment (nearest neighbour regionalisation);(ii) using forest and non-forest parameter sets calibrated to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5252302708377837673", "cites_id": ["5252302708377837673"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Teng/publication/267766920_Estimating_regional_model_parameters_using_spatial_land_cover_information_-_implications_for_predictions_in_ungauged_basins/links/552310140cf2a2d9e146d671/Estimating-regional-model-parameters-using-spatial-land-cover-information-implications-for-predictions-in-ungauged-basins.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aeCuQXzt40gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
