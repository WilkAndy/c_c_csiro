The particle size distribution of the sediments determined as well as the nutrient and heavy metal concentrations in the various particle size ranges. The dry solid samples are also subjected to chemical analysis to fractionate soluble, mobilisable and particulate residual contents for nutrients and metals across different particle size ranges. The objective of this study is to provide an indication of the potential loading and pollutant characteristics in urban stormwater from different geologic types in Melbourne. It is part of a larger study, which investigates the size and distribution of particulate pollutants actually transported in urban runoff from different geological conditions to develop relationships and pollutant load characteristic curves to assist in the design of stormwater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11926024938520139188", "cites_id": ["11926024938520139188"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/40644(2002)202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tFXxqn7AgaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
