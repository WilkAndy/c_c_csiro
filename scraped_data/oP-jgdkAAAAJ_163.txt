The study is part of Project C2 (Design and Management Procedures for Urban Waterways and Detention Basins) in the CRC's Urban Hydrology Program.The objectives of the study are to understand the quantities and characteristics of gross pollutants moving through the stormwater system, and to review and assess gross pollutant trapping techniques. A feature of this study is the extensive field monitoring which involved a range of parties, including federal, state and local agencies, community groups and two private companies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18074217120053745664", "cites_id": ["18074217120053745664"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18074217120053745664&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AFgWmrWE1PoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
