It can change flow magnitude and regime along a river, particularly for Transboundary Rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions. This study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data-sparse regions like the Tibetan Plateau. The framework is applied to the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB), where dam developments on the Tibetan Plateau are highly concerned. The results show that, despite being part of the \u2018Asian water tower\u2019, the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) contributes just 15\u201316% to Brahmaputra streamflow, for 48% of its contributing area. We found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in YTR suggests about 8\u201311% reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of Brahmaputra River.
