The empirical delta scaling method is used to scale the observed historical climate data, informed by the change signal in the GCM (for 2046\u20132075 relative to 1976\u20132005 for RCP8. 5), to reflect a future climate series. The historical and future runoffs are simulated using a daily hydrological model at 0.05o grid cells, using parameter values from the geographically nearest calibration catchment (the model is calibrated against streamflow data from more than 700 catchments).The plots in Figure 1 show the median and 10th to 90th percentile range of projections for mean summer, winter and annual runoffs. The median projection for Northern Australia is about 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9136291760698800132", "cites_id": ["9136291760698800132"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9136291760698800132&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BLjHQPOgyn4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
