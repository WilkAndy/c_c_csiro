This paper presents a lag correlation analysis using rainfall and streamflow data from 284 Australian catchments that show that the ENSO-hydroclimate relationship is a lot stronger when the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) phase is negative compared to when it is positive. The remarkable contrast in the hydroclimate-ENSO relationship between the two IPO phases suggests that the IPO should be considered in developing forecast models, particularly for long lead-times."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15791071927547386127", "cites_id": ["15791071927547386127"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6533db1d522cba5c75d7483eae7a024e7e4ffdef", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D9ka4EAoJdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
