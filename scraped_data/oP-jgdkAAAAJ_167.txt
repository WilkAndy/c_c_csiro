Flows during flood events often vary significantly within sub\u2010daily time\u2010scales, and failure to capture the sub\u2010daily flood characteristic can result in an underestimation of the instantaneous flood peaks, with possible risk of design failure. It is more common to find a longer record of daily flow series (observed or modelled using daily rainfall series) than sub\u2010daily flow data. This paper describes a novel approach, known as the steepness index unit volume flood hydrograph approach, for disaggregating daily flood flows into sub\u2010daily flows that takes advantage of the strong relationship between the standardized instantaneous flood peak and the standardized daily flood hydrograph rising\u2010limb steepness index. The strength of this relationship, which is considerably stronger than the relationship \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2084497687498911426", "cites_id": ["2084497687498911426"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6501", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wu5-Rpqf7RwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
