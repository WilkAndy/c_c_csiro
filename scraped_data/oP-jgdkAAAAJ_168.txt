Streamflow, which integrates information over large areas, is a potentially useful diagnostic for assessing the land surface schemes at large spatial scales. This paper discusses the use of streamflow for assessing the performance of the CSIRO9 land surface scheme over the Amazon and the Mississippi River Basins. The paper shows that although streamflow can be a useful diagnostic tool for testing land surface schemes over large scales its utility is undermined by various problems: the atmospheric control on evapotranspiration, the possibility of compensating errors within large basins, and most importantly the lack of reliable grid\u2010averaged atmospheric data at large spatial scales.
