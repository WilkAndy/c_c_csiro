Although investigating how mining activities such as open cut and/or underground mining change catchment baseflow is critical for understanding mining\u2010related hydrological mechanisms and for helping water resource management, published data on these changes have not been well documented. This study uses data\u2010driven approaches to examine how baseflow changes in four sets of paired catchments in the Hunter River Basin in Australia, which is one of the most intensive mining regions across the globe. The difference of cumulative anomaly percentage and double mass curves are used to detect the changes in baseflow and to identify the potential mining impacts. Our results show that underground mining has led to a decline in baseflow, while open cut mining has tended to increase baseflow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17801772393630975938", "cites_id": ["17801772393630975938"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR025770", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wse6lqyZDPcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
