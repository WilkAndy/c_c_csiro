Extreme storms and cyclones produce floods that can rise and fall within hours or that can last for months, while yearly variability in rainfall can produce droughts that may last for a decade or longer. Longerterm climate change increases or decreases average rainfall and evaporation, fundamentally changing the amount of water resources available. This chapter describes the influences of climatic events, variability, and change on water resources through their influence on floods, droughts, and water resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13032156977603754256", "cites_id": ["13032156977603754256"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AcuF11d9aecC&oi=fnd&pg=PA29&dq=info:EDkzS7mF27QJ:scholar.google.com&ots=CLhenyT101&sig=JGt6j41YjFfDSK3t1XS1-prldig", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EDkzS7mF27QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
