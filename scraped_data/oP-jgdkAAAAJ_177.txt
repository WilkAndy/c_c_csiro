Seasonal streamflow forecast can be used to help manage land and water resources systems, and allow decisions on water allocations for competing users to be more realistically based. Three methods for forecasting exceedance probabilities of streamflow are described and compared in this paper. The results indicate that the simple Nearest Neighbour method (exceedance probability forecast determined using the streamflow distribution in the historical data close to the present antecedent condition) can give reliable forecast for desktop studies to evaluate the benefits of using seasonal streamflow forecast. The Non-parametric Seasonal Forecasting Model (NSFM) (forecast determined using all the data, with higher weighting given to the present \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12518928899615140767", "cites_id": ["12518928899615140767"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.976119185860693", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n6vujYErvK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
