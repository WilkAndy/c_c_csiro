The tropical Jardine River catchment is 2500\u2009km2 and has an annual rainfall of 1700 mm\u2009y\u20131 while the Canning River catchment is 540\u2009km2, has a Mediterranean climate (annual rainfall of 800 mm\u2009y\u20131) and is ephemeral for half the year. It was found that the standard version of a land surface scheme developed for a GCM, and initialised as for incorporation into a GCM, simulated similar latent and sensible heat fluxes compared to a basin-scale hydrological model (MODHYDROLOG) which was calibrated for each catchment. However, the standard version of the land surface scheme grossly overestimated the observed peak runoff in the wet Jardine River catchment at the expense of runoff later in the season.
