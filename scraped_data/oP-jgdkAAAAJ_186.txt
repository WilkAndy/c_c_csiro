The Assessment area is influenced by the Australian monsoon to the northeast and the adjacent warm northern seas that generate tropical cyclones and tropical depressions. The marked seasonality and large year-to-year variability of these and associated processes, together with the strong seasonality in the temperature contrast between land and ocean, result in highly seasonal and variable rainfall events ranging from local-scale intermittent intense rainfall to large-scale persistent rainfall.All annual analyses undertaken in this report have used the 1 October to 30 September water year. The Pilbara is a semi-arid region that is significantly water limited, given annual potential evaporation (PE) can exceed annual rainfall by an order of magnitude. The Assessment area\u2019s 1911 to 2011 mean annual rainfall is 293 mm. There is large year-to-year variability, with annual rainfall ranging from 50 mm in 1924 to 708 mm in 2000. The wettest months are January to March, producing 60% of annual rainfall. February is the wettest month with an average of 70 mm, or 24%, of the annual rainfall and September is the driest with an average 2 mm, or 0.7%, of the annual rainfall. There are also strong spatial gradients with higher annual rainfall over the Hamersley Range (up to 500 mm) and 100 km inland the northeast coast. This is indicative of trough line preferential to thunderstorm development, with advection and convergence of moist sea \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10114600237457735783", "cites_id": ["10114600237457735783"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10114600237457735783&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZwDAllNHXowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
