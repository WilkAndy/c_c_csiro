As part of the CSIRO Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project, a rainfall-runoff modelling approach is used to estimate run-off and potential impact of climate change on run-off for 0.05\u00ba by 0.05\u00ba (~ 5 km x 5 km) grid cells across the Murray-Darling Basin. In the project, the rainfall-runoff models are calibrated using gauged stream-flow data that cover less than 1 percent of the entire Murray-Darling Basin. Climate change projections from global climate models and global warming scenarios in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC 4AR) are used.  This paper assesses the ability of two commonly used lumped conceptual daily rainfall-runoff models, Sacramento and SIMHYD, in estimating run-off in ungauged catchments and compares the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10240133719759550491", "cites_id": ["10240133719759550491"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.496748734766643", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G3jEEl1DHI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2}}
