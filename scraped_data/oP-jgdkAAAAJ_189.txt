Climate input to the models is distributed at ~25 km{2} grid cells and the catchments range in size from 50 to 12000 km{2}. Potential regionalisation of these predictions is tested by cross-verification of model predictions using a number of catchment attributes. Results show that nearest neighbour regionalisation provides the best results for both models. We also demonstrate that prediction quality can be improved in both calibration and cross-verification phases by combining predictions of the two models into a two-model ensemble. Further investigation using a multi-catchment ensemble approach indicates that the optimum number of catchments to include in a spatial ensemble is five or six, and that such an ensemble can lead to considerable improvement in run-off \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10938933500902882318", "cites_id": ["10938933500902882318"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.588534751184536", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Drzv5g_mzpcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
