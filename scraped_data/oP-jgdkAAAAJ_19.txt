This study evaluates the relative benefits of different methods using two conceptual daily rainfall\u2010runoff models, Xinanjiang and SIMHYD, on 210 relatively unimpacted catchments in southeast Australia. The results show that runoff predictions in ungauged catchments can benefit from a smart selection of donor catchments whose optimized parameter values are used to model runoff in the target ungauged catchment, output averaging of results from multiple\u2010donor catchments and incorporating leaf area index data into the rainfall\u2010runoff models. The biggest benefit comes from an educated selection of donor catchments (compared to a random selection of donor catchments) and output averaging of results from multiple\u2010donor catchments. The difference between the three commonly used approaches for selecting donor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 263, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13105220335154350934", "cites_id": ["13105220335154350934"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008wr007504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VssZ3HUY37UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 15, "2012": 20, "2013": 20, "2014": 21, "2015": 18, "2016": 15, "2017": 20, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 25, "2021": 23, "2022": 26, "2023": 12}}
