The report has been prepared for the Supervising Scientist at Jabiru.The objective of this consultancy is to estimate the storage capacity required to store surface runoff and other water within the total containment zone (TCZ) of the Jabiluka project, for various probabilities of exceedance. The consideration here is for a 241 400 m2 TCZ area, of which 90 000 m2 is the water storage area. This relates to the Kinhill-ERA storage capacity calculations reported in the Jabiluka Public Environment Report Appendix B1. For the calculations, we assume that the bunds and other drainage diversion structures can effectively prevent all water outside the TCZ from entering the TCZ and vice-versa."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1532268917705560451", "cites_id": ["1532268917705560451"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1532268917705560451&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g1E2XHa2QxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
