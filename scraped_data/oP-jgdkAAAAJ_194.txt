Hydrologists have excelled in developing models for numerous applications, through analysing and interpreting climate and hydrologic data to understand hydrologic processes, conceptualising the processes in hydrological models, and calibrating and testing models against observations. These models are particularly good at predicting the streamflow response to changes in the climate inputs (as long as the prediction period climate is not too different to the climatic conditions in the calibration period) and catchment characteristics. However, extrapolating hydrological models to predict further into the future is more challenging as streamflow will be increasingly influenced by higher temperatures and changed ecohydrological processes under higher CO2. Reliably modelling these is difficult because of the complex interactions and feedbacks between many variables and processes in a future environment that have not been seen in the past (ie, hydrologic non-stationarity that has not been observed). The paper by Milly et al.(2008) initiated significant discussions and an increased focus towards research on hydrologic non-stationarity.
