In this chapter, we consider the term drought to be several years with less than median rainfall. The combined impacts of drought and over-allocation of water for irrigation use have led to severe stress on floodplains and wetlands. Climate change projections suggest that the Murray-Darling Basin will be on average drier in the future. The recent drought period has experienced lower autumn and winter rain and higher temperatures than past droughts, resulting in the lowest runoff totals on record in recent years. While these features may be associated with climate change, they may equally be a result of large, long-term climate variability. The recent drought and declining river health have exposed the inadequacy of current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12667713200299140383", "cites_id": ["12667713200299140383"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-6636-5_16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H2VbDArCzK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
