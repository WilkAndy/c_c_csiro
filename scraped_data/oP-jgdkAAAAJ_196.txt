The science and software behind CWYET builds on existing knowledge and modelling capabilities. It is being developed with the flexibility to allow new scientific knowledge, modelling methods and data types to be easily incorporated into the model. The CWYET framework includes six daily rainfall-runoff models (Sacramento; SIMHYD; SMARG; GR4J; IHACRES and AWBM), all of which have been applied in numerous studies both within Australia and internationally. The framework also includes four optimisation methods and four pre-defined objective functions. The CWYET framework provides a Graphical User Interface and user guidelines for easy implementation of the modelling framework. CWYET has been tested using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4792184228749570785", "cites_id": ["4792184228749570785"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.344146274562840", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4fLYfCpCgUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
