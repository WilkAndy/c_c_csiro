It is an output of the Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project which assessed current and potential future water availability in 18 regions across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) considering climate change and other risks to water resources. The project was commissioned following the Murray-Darling Basin Water Summit convened by the then Prime Minister of Australia in November 2006 to report progressively during the latter half of 2007. The reports for each of the 18 regions and for the entire MDB are supported by a series of technical reports detailing the modelling and assessment methods used in the project. This report is one of the supporting technical reports of the project. Project reports can be accessed at http://www. csiro. au/mdbsy.Project findings are expected to inform the establishment of a new sustainable diversion limit for surface and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6019961425794005176", "cites_id": ["6019961425794005176"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6019961425794005176&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uHgBigUzi1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
