However, with such a staggering array of models available, this choice is becoming increasingly difficult. In this paper, we argue that with the availability of sophisticated models, many of which are being promoted as virtually universal problem solving platforms, more consideration must be given to model choice than in the past so that models are not misused and that the modelling approach is no more complicated than is necessary to solve the problem. An inappropriate choice is costly of time and resources as well as being ultimately disappointing. We discuss what we think are the four key considerations when selecting a model; overall objectives of exercise, access to expertise, available data and available resources (both time and money). We also include a section on model groups along with our generalised assessment of their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16808694283828823735", "cites_id": ["16808694283828823735"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.752361520211103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t4bBFWV6ROkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
