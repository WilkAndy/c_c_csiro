This paper reviews studies on the projected impacts of climate change on groundwater and associated environmental assets in southern Australia, and describes groundwater planning frameworks and management responses. High-risk areas are spatially patchy due to highly saline groundwater or low-transmissivity aquifers. The proportional reduction in rainfall is amplified in the groundwater recharge and some groundwater discharge fluxes. This leads to issues of deteriorating groundwater-dependent ecosystems, streamflow depletion, reduced submarine discharge, groundwater inundation and intrusion in coastal regions and reduced groundwater supply for extraction. Recent water reforms in Australia support the mitigation of these impacts, but groundwater adaptation is still at its infancy. Risk management is being incorporated in regional water and groundwater management plans to support a shift to a more sustainable level of use and more climate-resilient water resources in affected areas. The emerging strategies of groundwater trade and managed aquifer recharge are described, as is the need for a national water-focused climate change planning process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2337304397296335389", "cites_id": ["2337304397296335389"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/24/3588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HXrOPPfFbyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
