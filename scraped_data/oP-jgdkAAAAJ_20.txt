The complex conceptual model gives, by far, the best simulation of daily high and low flows, and can estimate adequately daily flows for the wetter catchments. It can provide satisfactory estimates of monthly and annual catchment yields in almost all catchments. However, the time-series approaches and the simple conceptual model can also provide adequate estimates of monthly and annual yields in the wetter catchments. As it is much easier to use these approaches than the complex conceptual model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 262, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2625715384442948664", "cites_id": ["2625715384442948664"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949390073I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OAwAAztqcCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 7, "2000": 13, "2001": 5, "2002": 11, "2003": 10, "2004": 6, "2005": 11, "2006": 11, "2007": 8, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 15, "2015": 7, "2016": 13, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
