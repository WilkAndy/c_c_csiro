Surface water and groundwater modelling was carried out to assess the cumulative regional-scale hydrological impacts of multiple coal and coal seam gas developments. The hydrological metrics assessed were groundwater drawdown and changes in low-flow characteristics as measured by the number of low-flow or zero flow days per year. Uncertainty in the modelling was also considered, and the results are presented as the median and plausible range (5th to 95th percentile) from many simulations which attempt to capture a wide range of uncertainty. The results indicate that under the best-case (5th percentile) scenario, the impact of additional/proposed coal resource developments on groundwater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3123617544778176255", "cites_id": ["3123617544778176255"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420307411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_1aueptRWSsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
