However, the estimation of reliable low flows is difficult for a variety of reasons including lack of its proper conceptualisation. Consequently, arbitrary flow data transformation is done to enhance the influence of lower flows to help improve the goodness-of-fit during parameter optimisation in rainfall-runoff modelling. We carried out systematic model calibration using a range of flow data transformations to identify the one that results in best goodness-of-fits in 595 catchments across different rainfall regions of Australia. Effects of transformation methods on the prediction of low flow surrogates, namely the Baseflow Index (BFI) and cease-to-flow days or the Zero Flow Days (ZFD) were also investigated and regionalised. We found that the square-root transformation performed the best in modelling flow time series \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=570757439031186744", "cites_id": ["570757439031186744"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420301189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OJVd5t286wcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
