This study investigates the sensitivity of the Bioregional Assessment results to climate change and hydroclimate variability, using the Gloucester sub-region as an example. The results indicate that the impact of climate change on streamflow under medium and high future projections can be greater than the impact from coal mining development, particularly where the proposed development is small. The differences in the modelled impact of coal resource development relative to the baseline under different plausible climate futures are relatively small for the Gloucester sub-region but can be significant in regions with large proposed development. The sequencing of hydroclimate time series, particularly when the mine footprint is large, significantly influences the modelled maximum coal resource development impact. The maximum impact on volumetric and high flow variables will be higher if rainfall is high in the period when the mine footprint is largest, and vice-versa for low flow variables. The results suggest that detailed analysis of coal resource development impact should take into account climate change and hydroclimate variability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10604636182383029427", "cites_id": ["10604636182383029427"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/333178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s-wxD2w8K5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
