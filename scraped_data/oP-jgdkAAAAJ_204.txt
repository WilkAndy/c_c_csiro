How does spatial rainfall variability affect catchment water balance? Can information of spatial rainfall variability improve streamflow prediction? This study was conducted to answer these questions. The modelling experiment was carried out using daily climate and streamflow data from a typical high yielding catchment in south-eastern Australia using the semi-distributed VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) model. Different spatial rainfall variability is generated and used as input into the VIC model to assess the sensitivity of streamflow to the spatial rainfall input.The VIC model was first driven with 0.05 gridded (distributed) daily rainfall series and calibrated against the observed daily streamflow data. The calibrated VIC model was used to simulate streamflow using both the distributed rainfall with different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2153827776465710475", "cites_id": ["2153827776465710475"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2153827776465710475&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i62bg_Pu4x0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
