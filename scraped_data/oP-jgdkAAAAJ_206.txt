It included an assessment of the impact of future climate and development. The development of farm dams was identified as having a likely impact on the sustainable yield. To assess this impact, the volume of farm dams in the Basin was projected to 2030 and then the impacted stream flows were modelled using a distributed water balance model for farm dam impacts known as CHEAT. This analysis was completed for each sub-catchment in the Basin in a consistent manner to estimate run-off time series that incorporated projection of future climate change. There was a projected growth in farm dam storage 227 GL in the Basin, which would result in a mean annual reduction in run-off of 180 GL, or 0.17 mm. This is a reduction in mean annual run-off of 0.65% across the Basin, or for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16568222978783995482", "cites_id": ["16568222978783995482"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.588404320385729", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WmbiWQQn7uUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
