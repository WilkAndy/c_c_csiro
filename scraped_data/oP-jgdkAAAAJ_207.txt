Extreme water levels and flood inundation extent in such a complex system are due to the combined effects of environmental forcings, estuarine hydrodynamics and floodplain topography. A comprehensive hydrologic and hydraulic model of the entire system is necessary to establish the design water levels to assist in floodplain planning and management. We have proposed that the annual exceedence probability (AEP) of extreme water levels in a coastal lagoon system can be estimated using a coupled stochastic-deterministic methodology. This method employs stochastic time series generation of environmental forcings as input to a Monte-Carlo type deterministic hydrodynamic simulation. Stochastic data generation requires knowledge of the correlations between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13127623032281198701", "cites_id": ["13127623032281198701"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.320370603237377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bXBbQJivLrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
