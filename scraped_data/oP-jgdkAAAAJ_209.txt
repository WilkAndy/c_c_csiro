However, there are some drawbacks and limitations in the automatic extraction of terraces, such as difficulty of outlining the overall boundary for individual terrace and the limitation of applying methods and parameters. In this study, we used machine learning methods on the basis of Geographic Object\u2010Based Image Analysis using K\u2010nearest neighbours and spectral angle mapper algorithms to extract terraces in the hilly and gully regions on the Loess Plateau, China. This study relied on medium\u2010resolution image Landsat\u20108 combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model to extract the overall boundary of terraces and relies on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14359306692544253284", "cites_id": ["14359306692544253284"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ldr.3405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZE39pVuBRscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
