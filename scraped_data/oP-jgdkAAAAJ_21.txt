Five lumped conceptual daily rainfall\u2013runoff models are used to model runoff using historical daily climate series and using future climate series obtained by empirically scaling the historical climate series informed by simulations from 15 GCMs. The majority of the GCMs project a drier future for this region, particularly in the southern parts, and this is amplified as a bigger reduction in the runoff. The results indicate that the uncertainty sourced from the GCMs is much larger than the uncertainty in the rainfall\u2013runoff models. The variability in the climate change impact on runoff results for one rainfall\u2013runoff model informed by 15 GCMs (an about 28%\u201335% difference between the minimum and maximum results for mean annual, mean seasonal, and high runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 245, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5624229765324313718", "cites_id": ["5624229765324313718"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/13/1/jhm-d-11-058_1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dpRVUSxHDU4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 15, "2015": 28, "2016": 24, "2017": 27, "2018": 30, "2019": 26, "2020": 27, "2021": 17, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
