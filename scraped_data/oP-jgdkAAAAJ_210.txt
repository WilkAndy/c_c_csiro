The results show the following: (1) All four models produced reasonable results in terms of annual, monthly and daily rainfall occurrence and amount, as well as daily extreme, multi-day extremes and dry/wet spell length. However, they also simulated a large range of variability, which not only demonstrates the advantages of multiple weather generators rather than a single model but also is more suitable for climate change and variability impact studies. (2) Every model has its own advantages and disadvantages \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14359473332334054857", "cites_id": ["14359473332334054857"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-017-2306-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yU13f-oYR8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
