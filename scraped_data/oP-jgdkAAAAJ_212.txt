Australia has a very variable climate, which is amplified as even greater variability in the river flows. Climate change impact on water will affect people, agriculture, ecosystems, industries and many other sectors. Climate science and modelling indicates that future winter and annual rainfall in southern Australia, where most water is consumed, is likely to decline and this will be amplified as an even bigger reduction in streamflow. The future hydroclimate in southern Australia will continue to be very variable with long wet and dry periods, but the decline in long-term average streamflow means that water resources systems need to cope with more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. As well as reducing streamflow, a warmer climate will also increase potential evaporation and hence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6800822435102383730", "cites_id": ["6800822435102383730"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116012&sb=RECENT&n=10&rpp=10&page=17&tr=5035&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ct7I8PhfYV4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
