Presented at the MODSIM 2011 International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, Perth, Australia", "pages": "3455-3461", "abstract": "Conceptual lumped rainfall-runoff models are widely used for surface runoff predictions in gauged and ungauged catchments because they are simple, easy to calibrate, and give relatively accurate runoff predictions. Lumped rainfall-runoff model inputs are generally daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (or air temperature). Vegetation processes are seldom considered in these models but they can play an important role in controlling runoff production in mid-latitude catchments. The use of surface vegetation information in rainfall-runoff modeling may allow better estimation of water balance components, evapotranspiration and water storage change resulting in more accurate estimates of runoff.Most studies calibrate the rainfall-runoff models against gauged streamflow data and use regionalisation methods to specify parameter values to model runoff in the ungauged catchments. This study investigates the potential to improve runoff and soil moisture prediction by incorporating vegetation time series data into lumped rainfall-runoff modelling. The modelling experiments are carried out using a daily conceptual lumped rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD. Daily rainfall, meteorological and streamflow data, NOAA-AVHRR monthly remotely sensed leaf area and TRMM-TMI daily microwave surface soil moisture for 470 unregulated catchments (50-5,000 km2) across Australia over the period of 1981 to 2006 are used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10089068225148230340", "cites_id": ["10089068225148230340"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongqiang-Zhang-15/publication/291347462_Incorporating_vegetation_time_series_to_improve_rainfall-runoff_model_predictions_in_gauged_and_ungauged_catchments/links/56a1690d08ae27f7de266c2b/Incorporating-vegetation-time-series-to-improve-rainfall-runoff-model-predictions-in-gauged-and-ungauged-catchments.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xBqkuhiSA4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
