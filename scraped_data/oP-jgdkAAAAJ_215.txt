Of special concern, are the increase in farm dam density from the 1970s and extensive groundwater extraction for irrigation, contributing to a decrease in streamflow. Changes in streamflow caused by land-use changes, however, are easily veiled by fluctuating climate variability because the impacts of land-use changes on streamflow can be comparatively small compared with those due to climate variance. Additional factors exacerbating the separation of land-use change impacts from the effects of climate variability on streamflow are the lack of good quality streamflow records, especially prior to land-use change periods of interest, and the capacity to estimate areal catchment precipitation with sufficient accuracy.Major subcatchments of the Googong (Queanbeyan River at Tinderry) and Cotter catchments (Cotter River at Gingera) are used as initial test cases (see Figure 1). The Googong Catchment is located 50 km south-east of the Australian Capital Territory and has an area of approximately 891 km2. Land-uses in this catchment are a mixture of nature reserves, low-intensity forestry, rural residential, grazing and recreation areas. Farm dam development and groundwater extraction have intensified in the Burra and Upper Googong"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7914402822137966607", "cites_id": ["7914402822137966607"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Upmanu-Lall/publication/222798781_Probabilistic_Multivariate_Forecasting_of_Reservoir_Inflows_using_Independent_Component_Analysis/links/09e4151007fc5cac34000000/Probabilistic-Multivariate-Forecasting-of-Reservoir-Inflows-using-Independent-Component-Analysis.pdf#page=60", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D_DhNm-b1W0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1}}
