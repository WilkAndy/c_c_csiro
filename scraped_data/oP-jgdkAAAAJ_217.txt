TPMb (Transition Probability Matrix with Boughton's correction) is one of the more robust and commonly used stochastic daily rainfall models in Australia. TPMb is one of the stochastic models in SCL (Stochastic Climate Library, www. toolkit. net. au), a software product in the Catchment Modelling Toolkit designed to facilitate the generation of stochastic climate data. The results here therefore also provide a perspective of the model performance that can be expected for different locations and historical data characteristics. Stochastic rainfall data provide alternative realisations that are equally likely to have occurred, and are often used as inputs into hydrological models to quantify uncertainty in environmental systems associated with climatic variability, allowing informed risk-based design and system operations decisions to be made. The TPMb model is used to generate 1000 replicates of 100-year daily rainfall time series for 101 locations across Australia, and the model performance is assessed by comparing key statistics in the stochastic replicates with those of the historical data. Two annual rainfall characteristics/statistics (mean annual rainfall and 5-year low rainfall total) and four daily rainfall characteristics (mean wet day rainfall, mean wet spell length, mean maximum 3-day rainfall and mean dry spell length) that are not used in calibrating the model are compared.
