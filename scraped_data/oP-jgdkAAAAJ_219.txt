Different models have been tested using data from across Australia, and the results have been reported in a series of CRC for Catchment Hydrology reports and research papers (see Reference section). The purpose of this report is to provide guidance on the use of the stochastic modelling software."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11624143902089497644", "cites_id": ["11624143902089497644"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11624143902089497644&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LEwRpkpBUaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
