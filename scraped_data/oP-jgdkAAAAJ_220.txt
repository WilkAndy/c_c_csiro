Stormwater quality models typically conceptualise the washoff process as being driven by either the raindrop impact energy or the overland flow shear stress, and empirical models estimate washoff as a function of either the rainfall and/or runoff volumes, or the rainfall intensity or runoff rate. However, the above explanatory variables are correlated to one another, and their relative importance on the washoff process is often lost in the model calibration. This paper presents data from a field study carried out to investigate the relative importance of rainfall and runoff energies on pollutant washoff from impervious surfaces. The experiments are carried out under simulated rainfall on a concrete surface, where half the surface is covered with insect screens to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12084680198864074240", "cites_id": ["12084680198864074240"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.280701007428669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AHZ9DZ1otacJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
