The national Rainman Streamflow Project set out to aid water management in Australia by: (1) working with primary producers and water agencies to assess the value of streamflow/runoffforecasts, (2) developing methods to forecast stream flows and runoff. (3) assembling a national streamflow and runoff data set for use in the Australian Rainman computer software package, and (4) building a communications-program to facilitate adoption of improved practices. Further information about these tasks may be found in the associated papers at this conference.
