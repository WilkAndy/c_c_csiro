Gridded ET products have the potential for application in ungauged basins, but their uncertainties are possibly large and it remains unclear which one is best for a given basin. The water balance (WB) method provides a direct estimate of basin scale ET, but it cannot be used in ungauged basins where streamflow data are unavailable. Here, we first assess the performance of ET from 10 global ET products against WB ET estimates in 43 large river basins. The paper then uses three indirect evaluation methods [Three Cornered Hat (TCH), Arithmetic Average (AA), and Bayesian Three Cornered Hat] to identify the optimal ET products without the need of prior information, and to generate fusion products combining the ET from multiple products \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15522381554298892045", "cites_id": ["15522381554298892045"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021WR031069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Da8PVMiTatcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
