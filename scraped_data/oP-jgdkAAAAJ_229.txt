The future will be warmer and is likely to be drier with more severe droughts. These changes pose a threat to sustainable management of the Murray-Darling Basin as they are likely to have significant impacts on the Basin\u2019s water availability, agricultural production, communities and the environment. Water resources adaptation to climate change is challenging because (i) water is a cross-cutting issue connected to many sectors,(ii) there are competing needs from different water users, and (iii) projections of the Basin\u2019s water future are highly variable. To better understand the threat posed by climate change, policy makers require information about plausible future climate scenarios to evaluate the robustness of the water systems in the Basin, so they can plan accordingly."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6615253465240580951", "cites_id": ["6615253465240580951"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdba.gov.au/sites/default/files/pubs/bp-eval-2020-plausible-climate-futures.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VzPWPvoZzlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
