The Penman-Monteith method is currently favoured by the FAO over the FAO-24 methods. The FAO also recommends alternative methods which may be used where there are limited data. In this paper, ETo, estimated using the Penman-Monteith and FAO-24 methods and class-A pan data for 16 Australian locations with a wide range of climate conditions are compared. The analyses indicate that the FAO-24 Penman ETo, estimates are generally 20 to 40% higher than the Penman-Monteith estimates. However, the FAO-24 Radiation and Penman-Monteith methods give similar daily ETo, estimates. Unlike Penman-Monteith, which also requires windspeed data, the FAO-24 Radiation method estimates ETo. from temperature and sunshine hours, climate variables \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=314582736389692878", "cites_id": ["314582736389692878"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037837749501172F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zl36_lSfXQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 13, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 9, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 18, "2012": 14, "2013": 15, "2014": 16, "2015": 14, "2016": 18, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 11, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
