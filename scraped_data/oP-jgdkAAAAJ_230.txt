Proceedings of Symposium J-H02 Held During IUGG2011 in Melbourne, Australia", "abstract": "Many studies examining the impact of climate change on runoff use a technique whereby the changes in rainfall for a particular region are derived per degree of global warming. These changes in rainfall are then used to drive a rainfall\u2013runoff model to produce a change in runoff, which can also be interpreted per degree of global warming. The technique assumes that the change in rainfall scales linearly with global average temperature. That is, a two degree increase in global average temperature will produce twice the change in rainfall as a one degree increase in global average temperature. This paper uses the CCCMA_T47, CCCMA_T63, CNRM and IAP global climate models (GCMs) to examine the nature of the relationship between runoff and global average temperature across a range of scales in southeastern Australia for projected temperature increases of 1.0, 1.3, 2.0 and 3.3 degrees, representing medium and high global warming scenarios for 2030 and 2060, respectively. Results indicate that for individual GCM grid cells (~ 40 000 km2) and most small catchments, the vast majority of runoff responses to increases in global average temperature up to 3.3 degrees are reasonably linear. This is particularly the case for large changes in runoff (> 5% per degree global warming), and more so when the projected changes in rainfall are consistent across all seasons. However, small projected changes in rainfall may display a non-linear runoff response to increases in global average temperature, particularly when the seasonal response shows increases in rainfall in one season and decreases in another. In the vast majority of cases, this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2151797536570656031", "cites_id": ["2151797536570656031"], "pub_url": "https://iahs.info/uploads/dms/16783.34-188-194-344-01-Post_IUGG_2011_DP_edits.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H8Xac3W43B0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
