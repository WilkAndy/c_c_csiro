Sometimes this is done through the transfer of calibrated models from 'similar' catchments, and sometimes it is done through the transfer of model parameters based on their relationships with measurable catchment attributes. Where the latter technique has been used, it is based on the assumption that rainfall-runoff model parameters are representative of the hydrologic response of the catchment and are thus largely independent of each other and of errors in the rainfall inputs.  In most applications, the observed runoff used to calibrate these rainfall-runoff models is only available at the catchment outlet and so is an aggregated response of spatially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6061454701362523710", "cites_id": ["6061454701362523710"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.593602919366766", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pq7VmO-cHlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
