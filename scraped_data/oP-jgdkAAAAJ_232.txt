Increasingly farmers, water resource agencies, catchment managers and others involved in environmental management are accessing on-line information on many aspects of the environment. These include current and forecast weather, levels in water storages, water quality, even ground cover from satellites. Soil moisture is an important parameter that affects many aspects of land and water management from crop response to the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff and flood forecasting, but at this stage there is no current or forecast information available nation-wide on soil moisture status.This study provides a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for deriving soil moisture estimates for the whole of Australia, based on readily available information. The focus of the work is on showing how such information can be produced and giving examples of likely output \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7032991907415988654", "cites_id": ["7032991907415988654"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7032991907415988654&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rhm6neA0mmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
