Data from 22 unimpaired catchments throughout Australia are used. The results indicate that a simple linear relationship can be used to estimate the percentage change in mean annual runoff for given percentage changes in mean annual rainfall and PET. The modelled runoff is about three to five times more sensitive to rainfall than to PET. Both models show very similar runoff sensitivity to rainfall, with percentage change in runoff of about two to three times the percentage change in rainfall. The runoff is more sensitive to PET in AWBM, with a one per cent increase in PET reflected as about 0.8 per cent reduction in runoff in AWBM compared to about 0.5 per cent reduction in runoff in SIMHYD. The runoff sensitivity to rainfall is higher in low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18048571108919151395", "cites_id": ["18048571108919151395"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.976268249630759", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IwuBUsxnefoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
