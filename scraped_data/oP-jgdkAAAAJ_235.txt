Physical forcings including river floods, coastal ocean level variations and winds are known to influence water level fluctuations in estuary and coastal lagoon systems, yet have not been comprehensively considered in establishing design water levels. In this paper we, (i) put forward a methodology for estimating the annual exceedence probability of water levels in large estuary systems that captures the cross-correlations between the various physical forcings (a coupled stochasticdeterministic methodology employing stochastic time series generation of the physical forcings as input for a Monte-Carlo type deterministic hydrodynamic simulation is proposed), (ii) present results of the preliminary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5593101923378293067", "cites_id": ["5593101923378293067"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.932760261742862", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S2mE15Cwnk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
