It is likely that the use of seasonal streamflow forecasts derived from ENS0 and serial correlations in streamflow can help improve the management of water systems. This paper illustrates some of the benefits and risks associated with using streamflow forecasts to manage an urban water supply system and a rural irrigation system. The results indicate that although there are risks involved, there is a net benefit in using ENS0 and streamflow persistence information to help manage water resource systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12017721272134509789", "cites_id": ["12017721272134509789"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.705480964991134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3aQ7C9OFx6YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
