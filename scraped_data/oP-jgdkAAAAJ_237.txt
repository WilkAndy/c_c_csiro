The potential evapotranspiration estimates are compared with Penman's estimates and the actual evapotranspiration estimates with lysimeter data. The global radiation, net radiation and albedo values estimated using Morton's model are also compared with measured and previously published data. The analyses indicate that Morton's procedure generally provides accurate estimates of daily global and net radiation. The daily potential evapotranspiration estimates can also be successfully used in rainfall-runoff modelling. The actual evapotranspiration estimates are also generally reliable under most conditions, with the estimates improving over longer time intervals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16249289117666103722", "cites_id": ["16249289117666103722"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.653085049813075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qtEbL1wSgeEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
