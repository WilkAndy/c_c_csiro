It is an update of the information presented in Post et al.(2008). 1 C of global warming corresponds to the change expected by~ 2030 under the A1B emission scenario, while 2 C of global warming corresponds to~ 2070 under the same scenario. As the projections are based on degrees of global warming rather than a specific date, they can be considered to potentially occur earlier under higher emission scenarios and global warming, and later under lower levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12031711982074050030", "cites_id": ["12031711982074050030"], "pub_url": "http://www.seaci.org/publications/documents/SEACI-2Reports/SEACI2_Projections_Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7rVVC006-aYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
