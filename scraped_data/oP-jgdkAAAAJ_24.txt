In this paper, a Bayesian joint probability (BJP) modeling approach for seasonal forecasting of streamflows at multiple sites is presented. A Box\u2010Cox transformed multivariate normal distribution is proposed to model the joint distribution of future streamflows and their predictors such as antecedent streamflows and El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation indices and other climate indicators. Bayesian inference of model parameters and uncertainties is implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, leading to joint probabilistic forecasts of streamflows at multiple sites. The model provides a parametric structure for quantifying relationships between variables, including intersite correlations. The Box\u2010Cox transformed multivariate normal distribution has considerable flexibility for modeling a wide range of predictors and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 235, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=923914697611537108", "cites_id": ["923914697611537108"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008WR007355", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1OrluYVn0gwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 13, "2013": 15, "2014": 17, "2015": 18, "2016": 23, "2017": 14, "2018": 23, "2019": 21, "2020": 20, "2021": 21, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
