The limitations include high computing load, restricted scope and validity of the results, excessive volume of results and failure to distinguish SA from uncertainty assessment. The new approach has three main aims: (i) to investigate sensitivity of a wide range of model outcomes, not only the values of individual output variables; (ii) to examine sensitivity to changes which are not small; (iii) to find efficiently features such as critical or nearredundant parameter combinations. Requirements such as output ranges, credible behaviour or given rank order of scenario outcomes define an acceptable outcome set. SA then explores the feasible set of parameter values producing acceptable outcomes. This inverts the mapping by the model from parameters to outcomes. Existing techniques for inverting an output set through a non-linear model work only on small numbers of parameters and outputs, and assume that the output set is bounded by either a box (pairs of bounds on individual variables) or an ellipsoid. Consequently it is proposed to simplify SA by set inversion by two tactics. First, the model is split into simpler sections, e.g. with linear dynamics, to allow use of efficient, approximate inversion methods such as ellipsoidal, orthotopic or parallelotopic bounding. Second, attention is confined to features of the feasible set which can answer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7565510618292093915", "cites_id": ["7565510618292093915"], "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/29314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2wO_09IX_mgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
