Solids in the urban runoff are considered as a primary pollutant, because apart from being a pollutant itself large amounts of nutrients and heavy metals are attached to solids. Most stormwater quality improvement measures attempt to remove pollutants by sedimentation and filtration. It is therefore important to understand the size distribution of pollutants to design appropriate stormwater treatment systems. This paper presents results from a water quality monitoring study to determine particle size distribution in urban stormwater from four primarily residential catchments in Melbourne with two each in sedimentary and basaltic geology and one commercial catchment from sedimentary geology in Brisbane. The results indicate that within each catchment the particle size distributions from different storm events are similar.
