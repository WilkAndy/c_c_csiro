These models simulate atmospheric processes and interactions between the atmosphere and the earth surface. Land surface schemes (LSS) are used to describe the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. This paper provides a general overview of NWP modelling and, in particular, current research issues related to LSSs. These include the initialisation of soil moisture, specification of landscape (soil and vegetation) properties, scale effects related to the importance and representation of subgrid variability of land surface states and parameters, and validation of predicted soil moisture fields. As part of a research program aimed at improving modelling of the land surface in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's suite of NWP models, a major experimental campaign is being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17852010294867220797", "cites_id": ["17852010294867220797"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.317165732180967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PVkteMcUv_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2}}
