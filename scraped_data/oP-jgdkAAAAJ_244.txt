This paper reports on issues encountered in assembling an adequate set of historical streamflow and runoff data suitable for seasonal forecasting. These include negotiating access to data held by state water agencies, assembling the data in a standard format, devising a system of national quality codes, assembling metadata, and extending monthly records from unimpaired streams by rainfall-runoff modelling."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7337385051950998666", "cites_id": ["7337385051950998666"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.573052326469827", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iuTMYdSg02UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
