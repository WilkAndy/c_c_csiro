The results show a large range in future projections of hydrological metrics, mainly because of the uncertainty in rainfall projections within and across the different climate projection datasets. Dynamical downscaling provides simulations at higher spatial resolutions, but projections from different datasets can be very different. The large number of approaches help provide a robust understanding of future hydroclimate conditions, but they can also be confusing. For water resources management, it may be prudent to communicate just a couple of future scenarios for impact assessments with stakeholders and policymakers, particularly when practically all of the projections indicate a drier future in the Basin. The median projection for 2046\u20132075 relative to 1981\u20132010 for a high global warming scenario is a 20% decline in streamflow across the Basin. More detailed assessments of the impact and adaptation options could then use all of the available datasets to represent the full modelled range of plausible futures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10022971197352375886", "cites_id": ["10022971197352375886"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1808910", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TvYoNDO_GIsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
