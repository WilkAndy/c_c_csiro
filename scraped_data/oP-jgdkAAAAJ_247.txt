The results show that modelled runoff and hydrologic responses can be influenced by the choice of historical data period used to calibrate and develop the hydrological model. Modelling approaches that do not take this into account may therefore underestimate the range and uncertainty in future runoff projections. Nevertheless, the uncertainty associated with the choice of hydrological models and consideration of calibration dataset for modelling climate change impact on runoff is likely to be small compared to the uncertainty in the future rainfall projections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11186365125572171226", "cites_id": ["11186365125572171226"], "pub_url": "https://piahs.copernicus.org/articles/371/3/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2hWMVdDzPZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
