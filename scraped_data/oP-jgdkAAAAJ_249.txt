This paper is part of a study that has an ultimate objective to isolate the impacts of land use change on streamflow from those of climate variation in the upper Murrumbidgee catchment, south-eastern Australia. The aim is to investigate the consistency or variability of catchment response and model parameters and performance over time and space. Subcatchments located in the upper part of the Queanbeyan (at Tinderry), Cotter (Gingera), Goodradigbee (Brindabella), Molonglo (Burbong) and Orroral (Crossing) Rivers with daily rainfall-discharge data for 40 years or more and minimal impact from dams have been selected for the study. As often occurs in non-experimental catchments, the land use in these catchments is closely correlated with climate differences, making a classic paired catchment study impossible. Instead, future research will focus on determining under what conditions the model performs well, and investigating whether a land use signal can be detected in the resulting subset of the data.For this purpose, both data-and model-based analyses of the dynamic relation between rainfall and runoff for these subcatchments are presented. Prior to performing the analyses, the rainfall data from selected stations have been checked and corrected to reduce the impact of errors in the areal rainfall estimates. Data analysis techniques (eg trend analysis, deconvolution and baseflow filtering) are used to assess the temporal and spatial variation in the hydrologic response characteristics for each site.
