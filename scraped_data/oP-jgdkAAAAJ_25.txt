However, the detection of a statistically significant trend can be difficult because of the large interannual variability and the relatively short period of instrumental record. In this paper, five statistical tests are applied to the historical annual streamflow series of 30 unregulated Australian rivers, located in protected natural catchments, in order to detect trends or changes in the means. The Student t\u2010statistic is also used to describe the relationship between interannual variability and the magnitude of change and length of data required to identify a statistically significant trend. The analysis indicates that, with the current data set, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the greenhouse effect is impacting on Australian streamflow volumes.
