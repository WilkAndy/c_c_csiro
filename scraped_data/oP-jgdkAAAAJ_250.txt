Four depths (usually 0-7cm, 0-30cm, 30-60cm and 60-90cm) are monitored at each site. Soil temperature and soil suction (the 60-600kPa range) are also measured at the midpoint of these layers. Rainfall is measured using tipping bucket raingauges. Volumetric soil moisture is monitored using Campbell Scientific CS615 sensors (Campbell Scientific Inc., 1996). Of all the sensors installed at these stations, the CS615s are the only ones requiring field calibration. Occasional measurements of volumetric soil moisture are also made with Time Domain Reflectometry and by gravimetric methods. This document outlines preliminary calibration of the CS615 sensors for each site."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5761983438333896918", "cites_id": ["5761983438333896918"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5761983438333896918&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1miTq2it9k8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2}}
