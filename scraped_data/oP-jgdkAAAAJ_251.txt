The Rainman Streamflow Project (Clarkson 2000) has assisted water management in Australia by working with primary producers and water agencies to assess the value of streamflow/runoff forecasts, develop methods to forecast streamflows and runoff, assemble a national streamflow and runoff data set for use in a STREAMFLOW supplement (Clarkson et al. 2000a) to the Australian Rainman computer software package (Clewett et al. 1999), and build communications to facilitate adoption of improved practices.
