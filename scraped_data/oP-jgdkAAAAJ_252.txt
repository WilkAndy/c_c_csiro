A set of guidelines were developed to assist Victorian water corporations to assess the impact of long-term declines in rainfall from climate change on water supplies (DELWP, 2016). In the flooding context, Australian Rainfall and Runoff recommends a 5% increase in daily rainfall intensity per degree of local warming for rainfall with an annual exceedance probability of 50% to 1% (Bates et al., 2016). However, recent studies (such as Guerreiro et al 2018) indicate that the increase in intensity for frequent sub-daily events is likely to be considerably more than 5%.  Despite the likely future reduction in long term annual rainfall under climate change, the potential increase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8135454360380680736", "cites_id": ["8135454360380680736"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.125908691608244", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IKrkJKPw5nAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
