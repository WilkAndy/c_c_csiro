Therefore future climate projections, particularly of rainfall, are of utmost interest to water resource management and water-users. General circulation models (GCMs) are the primary tool used to simulate present climate and project future climate. The outputs of GCMs are useful in understanding how future global climate responds to prescribed greenhouse gases emission scenarios. However GCMs do not provide realistic daily rainfall at scales below about 200 km, at which hydrological processes are typically assessed. Statistical downscaling techniques have been developed to resolve the scale discrepancy between GCM climate change scenarios and the resolution required for hydrological impact assessment, based on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9219369376625770950", "cites_id": ["9219369376625770950"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP115092&sb=RECENT&n=49&rpp=50&page=1&tr=5026&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xsHkCprH8X8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
