This paper explored the skills of forecasts for monthly and three-monthly total streamflows with a dynamic approach using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD for 31 catchments located in east Australia. For all the catchments, the SIMHYD was calibrated in a moving mode, ie using all the data prior to the forecast year. Retrospective forecasts of streamflow totals were generated from 1981 onwards using the calibrated SIMHYD model together with three types of forcings:\u2022 The observed daily rainfall\u2013this option uses observed (real) rainfall data, the prediction skill of the model reflects the performance of the model in the verification period with real forcings, ie, the top limit of the skills of the model-based forecasting.\u2022 The daily rainfall data from all the years prior to the prediction year.
