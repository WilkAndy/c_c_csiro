Consequently, there is great uncertainty in predictions of climate change impacts on streamflow and the security of water supply. In order to inform adaptations of water supply systems to a drier climate, it is desirable to identify GCM\u2019s in which we have more confidence. This study examines spatial variations in recent trends in streamflow across South Eastern Australia. Site to site variations in these trends are compared with forecast changes in streamflow produced in a recent assessment of future water yields for the Murray Darling Basin, carried out by CSIRO. Predicted changes were derived by downscaling GCM predictions, and rainfall-runoff modelling. Forecast changes are available for 15 different GCM\u2019s. Of these, only some predict a consistent pattern of streamflow change to across south East Australia to that recorded in recent decades. It is argued that greater confidence should be placed in these GCM\u2019s when assessing water resource futures for south east Australia.In the recent The Murray Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project, CSIRO used outputs from 16 GCM predictions to forecast streamflow changes across south-eastern Australia subject to enhanced atmospheric C02 concentrations (Chiew et al. 2008). We compared forecast changes with recent historic trends. If recent trends are due to climate change, we might expect the spatial pattern in trends to be similar to changes forecast by the GCM and CSIRO rainfall-runoff modeling.
