The purpose of the rainfall-runoff modelling is to use a consistent basin-wide approach to estimate runoff for 0.05o grid cells (~ 5 km x 5 km) across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) for four scenarios: historical climate (1895-2006) and current development; recent climate (1997-2006) and current development; future climate (~2030) and current development; and future climate (~2030) and future development (~2030).  The mean annual rainfall and modelled runoff, averaged over 1895 to 2006 over the entire MDB, are 457 mm and 27.3 mm respectively. The mean annual rainfall averaged over the MDB in the past ten years (1997-2006) is 440 mm, about 4 percent lower than the 1895 to 2006 long-term mean.
