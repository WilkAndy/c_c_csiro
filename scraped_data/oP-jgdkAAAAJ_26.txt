The modelling study is carried out using rainfall and streamflow data from eight unimpaired catchments near the headwaters of the Murray River in south-east Australia. The downscaling models used, in increasing order of complexity, are a daily scaling model, an analogue statistical downscaling model, GLIMCLIM and NHMM parametric statistical downscaling models, and CCAM dynamic downscaling model. All the downscaling models can generally reproduce the observed historical rainfall characteristics. The rainfall\u2013runoff modelling using downscaled rainfall also generally reproduces the observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2421243593600114927", "cites_id": ["2421243593600114927"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410001514", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:76A5Vzj8mSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 11, "2012": 19, "2013": 29, "2014": 13, "2015": 27, "2016": 20, "2017": 11, "2018": 20, "2019": 15, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
