In most applications, the observed run-off used to calibrate these rainfall-runoff models is only available at the catchment outlet and so is an aggregated response of spatially variable rainfall across the catchment. In many applications, the input climate data (rainfall and PET) used to calibrate the models is available at limited locations within the catchment or somewhere close to the catchment. Only in some applications is spatially variable climate data used to drive the models either as a lumped or distributed/gridded model.  To investigate the implications of input rainfall data and the model calibration and simulation methodology on the model results, two widely used daily rainfall-runoff models (SIMHYD and Sacramento) are calibrated using different types of point rainfall and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3101319138707756300", "cites_id": ["3101319138707756300"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.569417322673623", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DNXLPVMZCisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
