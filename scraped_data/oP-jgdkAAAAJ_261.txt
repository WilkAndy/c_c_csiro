The purpose of the MDBSY project was to (i) assess current and future water availability across the entire Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia considering climate change and other risks; and (ii) assess the hydrologic implications of future changes in water availability to consumptive water users and the environment.  The MDBSY Project is the most comprehensive and the most integrated hydrologic modelling ever undertaken for the entire MDB, and is providing governments with an unprecedented level of scenariobased hydrologic information to guide MDB-wide water resources planning and management. Led by CSIRO, the project involved over 100 professionals from twelve government and industry organisations as well as many \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10523378363670823982", "cites_id": ["10523378363670823982"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.591385595787041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LoSh092MCpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2}}
