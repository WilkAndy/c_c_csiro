Often such states are characterise as socially desirable and undesirable states, with for instance, high/low fish stocks or oligotrophic/eutrophic lake states. The significance is that small stochastic forces may force the system over a threshold toward an alternative, potentially undesirable, state. Much of the modelling undertaken in this field has focused on ecological systems. Until recently no investigation of similar behaviour in regional agricultural catchments has been made. This paper further develops the only published model of a regional agricultural catchment system predicted to have such multiple states."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16009743895025027261", "cites_id": ["16009743895025027261"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert-Argent/publication/228664151_Multiple_Stable_States_and_Thresholds_Within_the_Goulburn_Catchment/links/02e7e51d0c47f41417000000/Multiple-Stable-States-and-Thresholds-Within-the-Goulburn-Catchment.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vQjyzz8JLt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
