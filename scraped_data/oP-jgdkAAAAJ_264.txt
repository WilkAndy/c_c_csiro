Extreme estuarine levels are caused by the combined effects of river flows, coastal ocean levels (COLs), and local wind effects. This paper describes the development and testing of a generic stratified Monte- Carlo hydro-climatic modelling based joint probability (MBJP) method on the Gippsland Lakes - a large and complex coastal lagoon system in southeast Australia. Conceptually, two thousand years of stochastic concurrent hourly forcing sequences that preserve the space-time correlations are generated using a sequence of six hydro-climatic models comprising a daily stochastic temporal areal rainfall model, a daily stochastic spatial rainfall model, a daily conceptual rainfall-runoff model, an empirical hourly flow disaggregation and routing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5485136493383243591", "cites_id": ["5485136493383243591"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.977796153273931", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R9ejSJQeH0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
