These two regions are particu-larly interesting due to the strong effect of ENSO on their hydrology. In eastern and south-eastern Australia, there is a strong tendency for below normal hydro-logic conditions following an E1 Nifio event. The relationship is strong enough to develop a seasonal streamflow forecast. Inthe western US, the potential of making a six-month lead time forecast of spring-summer runoff is demonstrated for the Columbia River basin. The skill associated with these forecasts is better than the baseline\" climatology\" condition and there are potential benefits of using these forecasts in the management of water resource systems. The potential bene-fits of using this forecast are demonstrated for an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16279645283338744410", "cites_id": ["16279645283338744410"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/WS003#page=226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WvLExiHr7OEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
