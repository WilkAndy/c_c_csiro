Supervising Scientist report 142", "pub_year": 1999, "citation": "", "author": "FHS Chiew and QJ Wang", "abstract": "[en] The report is prepared for the Supervising Scientist at Jabiru. It describes part of an investigation into hydrological issues relating to the water management system proposed for the Jabiluka project. Specifically, the objective is to estimate the water storage capacity required to store surface runoff and other water within the total containment zone (TCZ) of the Jabiluka project. The water storage volume is calculated for a range of probabilities up to 0.002% that the pond design volume would be exceeded over a 30-year mine life. In this study, 50 000 sets of 30 years of daily rainfall and monthly pan evaporation data are stochastically generated to simulate the storage water balance. The approach used by Kinhill and Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) is reviewed and the pond design compared with the estimates derived here. The Kinhill-ERA approach is described in the Jabiluka Mill Alternative Public Environment Report and the Jabiluka Mill Alternative Public Environment Report Technical Appendices (hereon referred to as Jabiluka PER Appendices)(1998). The two reports also provide background to many other issues. The structural design of the storage and other features of the mine site are not considered here. This study also assumes that the bunds and other drainage diversion structures will prevent all water outside the TCZ from entering the TCZ and vice versa. The storage water balance components are discussed in section 2. Some of the water inflows into the storage and losses from the storage are discussed in detail, while elsewhere, the values used by Kinhill-ERA are adopted. Section 3 describes the selection of the climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15964271480911875621", "cites_id": ["15964271480911875621"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:32037644", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jc6mXVR8jN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
