Many investigators have suggested alternate models such as the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution as an improvement over the LP3 distribution. Using floodflow data at 61 sites across Australia, we explore the suitability of various flood frequency models using L-moment diagrams. We also repeat the experiment performed in the original US Water Resource Council report (Bulletin 17B) which led to the LP3 mandate in the United States. Our evaluations reveal that among the models tested, the GEV and Wakeby distributions provide the best approximation to floodflow data in the regions of Australia that are dominated by rainfall during the winter months, such as southwest Western Australia and Tasmania.
