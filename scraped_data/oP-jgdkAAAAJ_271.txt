This spatial information can be used to assess the service of nutrient retention by natural vegetation. The retention service is of particular interest for surface water quality issues and can be valued in economic or social terms, such as avoided treatment costs or improved water security through access to clean drinking water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3730347207503546793,18355897723857934632", "cites_id": ["3730347207503546793", "18355897723857934632"], "pub_url": "https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/3.8.5/pdf/#page=118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qYkeYAXbxDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
