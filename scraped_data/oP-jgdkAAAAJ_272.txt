Temperature and potential evaporation will be higher. Changes in future precipitation will be amplified in the river flows. Security of water supply will be compromised due to longer and more severe droughts, more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, increased seasonality of river flow and retreat of glaciers. Flood risk will increase due to more intense heavy precipitation events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9422210056619781033", "cites_id": ["9422210056619781033"], "pub_url": "https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/4313916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qWvvHyBqwoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
