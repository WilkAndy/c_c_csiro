Inevitably, simplifications are made due to a lack of process understanding, the complexities of scale and paucity of data. As a result the majority of hydrological models require calibration. However, it is unlikely that one unique calibrated parameter set based on an objective function and a limited length of historical observed streamflow data can reproduce the complexity of the observed rainfall-runoff relationship for all the streamflow characteristics. This can be particularly prevalent when calibrated parameters are used to simulate runoff under climatic conditions that are different to the calibration period.  This paper investigates the ability of two commonly used hydrological models (Sacramento and GR4J) in simulating streamflow under variable climate conditions, when calibrated against three objective functions using data from ten unregulated catchments in southeast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7487940339712404888", "cites_id": ["7487940339712404888"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.903913884846744", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mC3g7xCC6mcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
