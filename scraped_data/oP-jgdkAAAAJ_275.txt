It has the potential to capture a fuller range of potential changes in future rainfall characteristics compared to simple perturbation or scaling methods. Like the scaling methods, analogues also ensure that the daily spatial correlation over large regions is preserved. However, the use of analogues based solely on observed historical data is a limitation. The modelling results here indicate that the analogue method can be useful for hydrological impact studies over large regions. More research is nevertheless required to continue to improve the analogue method (including posterior corrections of GCM predictor variables used to define the weather states and bias-adjusting the daily rainfall outputs from the analogue method) in order to produce daily rainfall that are sufficiently similar to the observed daily rainfall for direct use in hydrological models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2300152408812548170", "cites_id": ["2300152408812548170"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Teng/publication/266178244_Assessing_historical_and_future_runoff_modelled_using_rainfall_from_the_analogue_downscaling_method/links/552310140cf29dcabb0ee11b/Assessing-historical-and-future-runoff-modelled-using-rainfall-from-the-analogue-downscaling-method.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SvCH2G3I6x8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
