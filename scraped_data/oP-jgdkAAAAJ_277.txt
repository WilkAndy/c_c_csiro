The need for demonstrably objective climate change scenarios consistent with what is realistic under global warming predicted conditions is increasingly growing. Global climate models (GCMs) are the best tools available for simulating global and regional climate for predicting future climate. However, GCMs provide information at a resolution that is too coarse to give results that can be directly used in hydrological studies. This paper quantifies three simple methods of rainfall scenarios construction informed by GCMs for their potential use in providing desirable future rainfall scenarios for modelling runoff projections. Runoff simulations from daily rainfall time series obtained using three simple methods (constant scaling, daily scaling and daily translation) to transform GCM outputs to catchment-scale rainfall over South-East Australia for 1981-2000 and 2046-2065 periods are used. In the constant scaling and daily scaling methods, the historical observed daily rainfall is scaled by the changes indicated by the GCM. In the constant scaling method, the entire daily rainfall series (in seasons) is scaled by the same factor. In daily scaling, the different daily rainfall amounts are scaled differently. In daily translation, a relationship between GCM simulation of the present rainfall and the observed catchment-scale rainfall is established, and used to convert the future GCM daily rainfall time series to catchment-scale rainfall series. In summary, the constant scaling method can be used in most applications to transform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6977513114526730092", "cites_id": ["6977513114526730092"], "pub_url": "https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/iemssconference/2008/all/121/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bMf-jjUb1WAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
