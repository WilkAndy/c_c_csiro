However, availability of these data at the required resolution is available only at a limited number of locations in Australia. On the other hand, an extensive network of daily read rain gauges with much wider coverage is available. This daily data could be more useful if a means to predict within-day rainfall distribution from daily data is established as these statistics could enable significant improvements to the predictive skill of the hydrologic and erosion modelling. The prediction of sub-daily rainfall intensity variation conditioned to the daily measurements of the particular day has rarely been attempted. Towards this objective, in this study, multivariate regression relationships were established to predict the parameters of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16374518042022598097", "cites_id": ["16374518042022598097"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.592279978407434", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0VX7Pmf5PeMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
