However, RS-based evaporation (E{RS}) estimates are seldom used together with conceptual rainfall-runoff (RR) models to estimate catchment runoff. This paper investigates whether simple uses of E{RS} in a lumped conceptual daily RR model, SIMHYD, can improve daily runoff estimates. The study was conducted in 120 gauged catchments in Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) for the period of 2001 to 2005. Firstly, a spatially explicit daily E{RS} model was used to estimate 1 km x 1 km gridded E{RS} by using Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), leaf area index and gridded surface meteorological data over the MDB. The gridded E{RS} was then aggregated to obtain catchment E{RS}. Various modifications of the SIMHYD model to use the catchment E{RS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15379617004945155170", "cites_id": ["15379617004945155170"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.593789249079348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YiRQaS5gb9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
