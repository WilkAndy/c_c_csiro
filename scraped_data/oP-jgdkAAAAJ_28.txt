This paper describes the development and use of a seasonal streamflow forecast model based on an optimal linear combination of forecasts derived from climatology, persistence, the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), and equatorial Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST). The model builds on the work of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and that of other researchers who have investigated southeast Australian rivers. The model is tested using 66 years of unimpaired streamflow data from 10 eastern Australian catchments. Results from testing the model further support the ENSO\u2010hydroclimate link, showing that eastern Australia generally receives below normal streamflow during El Ni\u00f1o conditions and above normal streamflow during La Ni\u00f1a conditions. In southeast Australia the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14363510013853930594", "cites_id": ["14363510013853930594"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98WR02406", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YpSHp0FwVccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 8, "2002": 4, "2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 5, "2006": 14, "2007": 11, "2008": 4, "2009": 11, "2010": 6, "2011": 18, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
