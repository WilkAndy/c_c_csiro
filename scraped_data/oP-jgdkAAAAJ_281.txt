Although irrigators have a legally defined entitlement to irrigation water, their actual allocation can be highly variable from year to year. Goulburn-Murray Water provides a probability that the allocation will reach a certain level, based on the probability that the inflows will be sufficient to satisfy that allocation. However forecasts of the actual allocations are currently not available. Forecasts in the form of continuous exceedence probabilities would allow irrigators to take a known risk in their decisions relating to water availability for the forthcoming irrigation season."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3882980202502836958", "cites_id": ["3882980202502836958"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=daa0067d069e9e8cd92833ad5c2f17f23c10b5c4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3lIO2Osd4zUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
