This is because the parameters are correlated to one another, and various combinations of parameter values can give similar results. This paper presents a regional calibration method used to overcome the problem. The 175 catchments in the 23,000 km2 south-east Queensland area are grouped into nine hydrologic regions, with the daily rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD calibrated separately for each region to determine the one set of parameter values for each region. In the model calibration, parameter values are optimised to provide a good overall fit between the modelled and recorded streamflows at five to eight gauged catchments in a region, with constraints used to ensure that the model gives hydrologically consistent distinction between forested and non-forested catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6129815000920486377", "cites_id": ["6129815000920486377"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.358717258086753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6fG5JER6EVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
