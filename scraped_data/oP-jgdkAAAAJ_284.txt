Bias-correction of downscaled GCM output is integral to any hydrological investigations of climate change due to discrepancies between the statistics of downscaled GCM simulations and observations. Many bias-correction techniques have been developed to support hydrological applications. However, there have been few comparisons of the sensitivity of hydrological simulations to different bias-correction assumptions. This paper investigates the importance of two common assumptions: (i) simultaneously correcting bias at multiple time scales, and (ii) explicitly handling rainfall autocorrelation; in quantile mapping of downscaled GCM rainfall data for hydrological simulation. Four quantile mapping methods are applied to correct bias in dynamically downscaled reanalysis and historical GCM simulations of rainfall for 11 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17259421069694544768", "cites_id": ["17259421069694544768"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169423002640", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
