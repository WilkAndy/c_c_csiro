The rainfall anomaly before, during and after the Millennium Drought (1997\u20132009) is compared to quantify the variability. The results show: (a) a declining rainfall trend is detected as the recent dry decades were preceded by wet decades. The declining trend largely occurs from autumn through to spring with the largest trend in August to October followed by April and May; (b) the trend is more significant for number of rainfall days and for multi\u2010day rainfall totals (and more so for longer accumulations) than for annual rainfall; (c) the very high extreme rainfall shows a small increasing trend in summer and mixed signal in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3098393543145833180", "cites_id": ["3098393543145833180"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.7923", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3EKS8YK0_yoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
