The study is performed in the Tacna region in southern Peru, geographically within the Atacama Desert and under prevailing water scarcity conditions. We examined the benefits and costs to four main water users: urban, agriculture, mining and the environment over a 30-year time horizon. The main scenarios under consideration include reduced water demand from improved water use efficiency in the urban and agriculture sector, and investment in water supply infrastructure including inter-basin infrastructure and dams, a desalination plant, and increased groundwater extraction. Our findings suggest that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13338188047966157250", "cites_id": ["13338188047966157250"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377422000658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wjliYlzDGrkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
