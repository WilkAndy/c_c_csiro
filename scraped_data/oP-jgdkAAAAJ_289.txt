Briefly, we propose downscaling CMIP5 models using empirical scaling, comparison with analogue downscaled rainfall, and hydrological modelling using SIMHYD. The main differences between earlier projections by SEACI are the updated CMIP5 model dataset, new RCP scenarios, and the ready availability of analogue downscaling data. Anticipated work load is 0.5 FTE, and includes 0.15 FTE for modelling support (GCM/hydrological modelling)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6491423368887872785", "cites_id": ["6491423368887872785"], "pub_url": "http://www.bom.gov.au/research/projects/vicci/docs/2015/PotterEtAl.2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ES07NSkrFloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
