It is generally accepted that the major source of uncertainty is general circulation models (GCMs). With the CMIP5 GCM simulations gradually becoming available, it is worth exploring if using CMIP5 GCMs can reduce the uncertainty in future water projections compared to using the CMIP3 GCMs. This study presents the future mean annual runoff (2046-2065 relative to 1961-2000) across continental Australia estimated by the Budyko equation using rainfall projections from the available CMIP5 GCMs, and compares the range of estimates with those from the CMIP3 GCMs. The results show that the range of future runoff projections, informed by the 19 CMIP5 and 19 CMIP3 GCMs are similar and both are very large, with about 50% difference between the 10th percentile and 90th percentile projections.
