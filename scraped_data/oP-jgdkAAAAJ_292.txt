Statistical downscaling is a robust approach providing a link between observed (re-analysis) large-scale atmospheric variables (predictors) and local or regional surface climate variables such as daily station rainfall. When applied to outputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs), the credibility of statistically downscaled future projections is dependent on the ability of GCMs to reproduce the re-analysis data statistics for the current climate. The main objective of this study is thus to assess daily predictor variables \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=665243031163326251", "cites_id": ["665243031163326251"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EGUGA..1413756M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K0_LIQNrOwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
