However, there is considerable uncertainty in the timing and amount of reduction in the future rainfall and water availability. The runoff in far south-west Australia in the past 40 years and in south-eastern Australia in the past 15 years has also been significantly lower than the long-term average. This presents a challenge in interpreting and communicating the climate change projections, as the quantitative estimate of future water availability is dependent both on the projected change as well as the hydroclimate baseline period that this relative change is compared to. The choice of hydroclimate baseline will always be somewhat subjective and science can only provide some guidance. Most water resources planning for Perth and surrounding regions are now based on data from 1975 onwards \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1513156830730618339", "cites_id": ["1513156830730618339"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Post-3/publication/286317716_Hydroclimate_baseline_and_future_water_availability_projections_for_water_resources_planning/links/5d6a2454a6fdcc547d6d1b90/Hydroclimate-baseline-and-future-water-availability-projections-for-water-resources-planning.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:44Un2R7Q_xQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
