These projections were produced as an output of Phase 2 of the South Eastern Australian Climate Initiative (SEACI). 1 degreesC of global warming corresponds to the change expected by ~2030 under the A1B emission scenario. As the projections are based on 1 degree of global warming rather than a specific date, they can be considered to potentially occur earlier under higher levels of global warming, and later under lower levels. Daily rainfall and areal potential evapotranspiration (APET) data from 1895-2008 were used for the modelling. The projections were derived from 15 global climate models (GCMs). The future climate series for ~2030 was obtained by scaling the historical 1895-2008 daily rainfall and areal PET data using the daily scaling method under 1 degreesC of global \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1716458406335570963", "cites_id": ["1716458406335570963"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.907659112069642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E2RdjdMV0hcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
