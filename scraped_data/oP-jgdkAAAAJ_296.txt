This paper presents results from a modelling study carried out to evaluate the performance of conceptual rainfall-runoff models in predicting medium-term runoff using calibrated parameter values based on different periods of historical observed data. Four rainfall-runoff models are calibrated using moving windows of long term as well as one, two, five, ten and 20 years of historical daily climate and streamflow data for 20 catchments in south-eastern Australia. The calibrated models are used to predict the subsequent one, two, five and ten years of runoff. The results show that it is more difficult to predict streamflow as the forecast time increases. The best predictions are for the next one year with progressive deterioration in the predictions as we move to longer forecast times of two, five and ten years.
