The method is applied to the 1,060,000 km2 Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia. Climate sequences were developed based upon three scenarios for a 2030 climate relative to a 1990 climate from the outputs of 15 global climate models. Dryland diffuse groundwater recharge was modelled in WAVES using these 45 climate scenarios and fitted to a Pearson Type III probability distribution to condense the 45 scenarios down to three: a wet future, a median future and a dry future. The use of a probability distribution allowed the significance of any change in recharge to be assessed. This study found that for the median future, climate recharge is projected to increase on average by 5% across the MDB but this is not spatially uniform. In the wet and dry future scenarios the recharge is projected to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16202519210683186797", "cites_id": ["16202519210683186797"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-010-0625-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bb42o2Dp2uAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
