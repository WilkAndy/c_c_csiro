Daily rainfall and areal potential evapotranspiration (APET) data from 1895\u20132006 are used for the modelling.The methods used here and the presentation in this report are very similar to the Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields (MDBSY) Project. However, unlike the MDBSY Project, this study reports on the IPCC SRES A1B global warming scenario. Specifically, this study presents the range of runoff modelling results using climate change projections from 15 global climate models (GCMs) for the IPCC SRES A1B global warming scenario for the SEACI region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=403239940538872170", "cites_id": ["403239940538872170"], "pub_url": "https://www.seaci.org/publications/documents/SEACI-1%20Reports/S1_FR222.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:arER55aYmAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
