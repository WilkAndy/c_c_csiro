This paper presents an overview of the relationship between ENSO and rainfall, drought and streamflow in Australia. The teleconnection between ENSO and the hydroclimate of Australia is investigated using the empirical method of Ropelewski and Halpert and the potential for forecasting the hydroclimate variables are investigated by assessing the lag correlations between rainfall and streamflow and the indicators of ENSO several months earlier. The analyses show that dry conditions in Australia tend to be associated with El Nino. The link between rainfall and streamflow and ENSO is statistically significant in most parts of Australia, but it is not sufficiently strong to consistently predict rainfall and streamflow accurately. The teleconnection is stronger in the latter part of the year, and the analyses suggest that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 599, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1255579794961134852", "cites_id": ["1255579794961134852"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169497001212", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BPXQ0Su3bBEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 6, "2000": 8, "2001": 21, "2002": 11, "2003": 12, "2004": 19, "2005": 20, "2006": 16, "2007": 19, "2008": 19, "2009": 22, "2010": 29, "2011": 29, "2012": 31, "2013": 24, "2014": 33, "2015": 31, "2016": 40, "2017": 28, "2018": 40, "2019": 40, "2020": 37, "2021": 31, "2022": 18, "2023": 10}}
