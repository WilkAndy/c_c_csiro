While it is agreed that these pressures are increasing, views divide on how they may be alleviated. Some suggest technological advances will automatically keep us from transgressing key environmental thresholds; others that policy reform can reconcile economic and ecological goals; while a third school argues that only a fundamental shift in societal values can keep human demands within the Earth\u2019s ecological limits. Here we use novel integrated analysis of the energy\u2013water\u2013food nexus, rural land use (including biodiversity), material flows and climate change to explore whether mounting ecological pressures in Australia can be reversed, while the population grows and living standards improve. We show that, in the right circumstances, economic and environmental outcomes can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8176885194274517270", "cites_id": ["8176885194274517270"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16065", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FjHi3cIhenEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 19, "2017": 25, "2018": 25, "2019": 21, "2020": 22, "2021": 31, "2022": 26, "2023": 7}}
