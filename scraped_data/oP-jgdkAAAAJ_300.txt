In this paper, a joint probability approach for seasonal forecasting of stream flows at multiple sites is presented. A Box-Cox transformed multivariate normal distribution is used to model the joint distribution of future stream flows, El-Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals, and antecedent stream flows. A Bayesian inference of model parameters and uncertainties is implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. A probabilistic forecast of stream flows is provided. The approach provides a parametric structure for quantifying relationships between variables and thus facilitates the transfer of learning acquired from regional applications. It provides a flexible structure for incorporating new predictors and allows for non-concurrent and missing data. For forecasting stream flows at multiple sites, it provides a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8773483405895489222", "cites_id": ["8773483405895489222"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.588329788500696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xlYve6yswXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
