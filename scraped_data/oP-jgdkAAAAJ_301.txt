The modelling results for monthly runoff over the calibration period are satisfactory and those over the validation period are also reasonable. The SIMHYD is able to reproduce satisfactorily the total recorded monthly stream-flow; the total modelled flow over the verification period is 10-15% greater than the total recorded flow. The results show that it is possible to apply SIMHYD to model streamflow in the two catchments. The next step will be to use SIMHYD (and other simple rainfall-runoff models) for other catchments in China with the purpose of correlating the model parameters to physical and climatic characteristics of the basins so as to regionalize SIMHYD (and other simple models) for use in ungauged catchments rather than the application of complex hydrological models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13006975147633014695", "cites_id": ["13006975147633014695"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20093172555", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p_f_nPsOgrQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
