Attempts at applying \u2018regional\u2019information to infer ungauged hydrological behaviour have met with little success. Recent focus has been on finding correlations between conceptual rainfallrunoff model parameters and catchment physical characteristics, be they measured or estimated (Chiew and Siriwardena, 2005; Merz and Bloschl, 2004). This approach (referred to as \u2018parameter regression\u2019) has been thwarted, largely due to the many sources of error and uncertainty in the modelling of complex natural systems, and the implications of this for estimation of meaningful parameter values. Errors typically arise from input data, model structure, parameter choice and observed output data. Together these uncertainties combine to hamper attempts at predicting ungauged streamflow.This paper continues the development of a model averaging approach to the problem. Rather than searching for a single relationship between optimal parameter values and catchment physical characteristics, the model averaging approach relates gauged catchments to ungauged based on measures of physical similarity (McIntyre et al., 2005; Reichl et al., 2006). This paper investigates the usefulness of catchment attributes in assessing catchment similarity within the model averaging context. The implication of the selection is that these attributes can be considered important in controlling catchment-scale rainfall-runoff processes. The study is designed to inform the next stage of the development of the model averaging \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9751205637410051056", "cites_id": ["9751205637410051056"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/90352739/DevelopingSimilars40_Reichl_.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8NOc9dw9U4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
