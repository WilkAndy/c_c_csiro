Dry conditions are almost always experienced across Australia during moderate to strong El Ni\u00f1o years, and the very wet conditions can usually be related to La Ni\u00f1a. The linear correlation between streamflow and indicators of ENSO is greater than 0.5 in many Australian catchments, particularly in spring and summer. For example, the whisker plots on the right show that inflows into a medium-size reservoir in south-east Australia are typically lower when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is strongly negative (El Ni\u00f1o) compared to when the SOI is positive.The lag relationship between streamflow and ENSO can be exploited to forecast successfully streamflow several months ahead, particularly in spring and summer throughout eastern Australia. The ENSO\u2013streamflow relationship is stronger in the middle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2850101694226909685", "cites_id": ["2850101694226909685"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2850101694226909685&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Uki8mOYjScJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
