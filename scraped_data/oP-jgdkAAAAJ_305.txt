This paper compares simulations of the stand-alone VB95 land surface model with various soil and vegetation parameter sets against soil moisture and soil temperature observations across the Murrumbidgee River catchment. The results indicate that the simulations are sensitive to the soil and vegetation parameters. In general, VB95 can model the temporal fluctuation in soil moisture, and therefore the moisture fluxes, realistically. However, the model exhibits a significant bias in the absolute soil moisture and soil temperature, highlighting the need to improve the model formulation or our estimates of soil and vegetation properties for modelling applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2846904229390467045", "cites_id": ["2846904229390467045"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harald-Richter-3/publication/242391323_Comparisons_of_Soil_Moisture_Simulations_from_the_VB95_Land_Surface_Model_Against_Observations/links/02e7e52a66126112b5000000/Comparisons-of-Soil-Moisture-Simulations-from-the-VB95-Land-Surface-Model-Against-Observations.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5T9gJlA8gicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
