Summer streamflow throughout most of east Australia including east of the Dividing Range can be forecast from spring indicators of ENSO. The lag streamflow-ENSO relationship in late summer is considerably stronger in the summer dominated rainfall regions in northern New South Wales and Queensland than in the winter dominated rainfall regions in Victoria.The serial correlation in streamflow must also be considered in forecasting streamflow because it is generally stronger than the lag streamflow-ENSO relationship (except in north-east Australia). In addition, unlike the streamflow-ENSO relationship, which is statistically significant only in the latter and very early parts of the year, the persistency in streamflow exists throughout the year. The streamflow persistence results from the delayed response in the rainfall-runoff process due to soil and groundwater storage, giving streamflow a memory of conditions over several months. However, this memory disappears relatively quickly and for longer lead times, ENSO indicators may be better explanatory variables for forecasting streamflow."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14523443163666463980", "cites_id": ["14523443163666463980"], "pub_url": "https://data.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/static/publications/current-and-future-challenges-2003-workbook.pdf#page=22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7Dzq3ZuijckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
