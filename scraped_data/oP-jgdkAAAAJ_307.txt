The potential climate change impact on runoff is estimated by comparing the runoff simulated by the conceptual daily rainfall-runoff model, SIMHYD, using the present climate data and using future climate change scenarios provided by CSIRO Atmospheric Research (CAR)(see companion report 1A) and CSIRO Land & Water (CLW)(see companion report 1B)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4108885579162521107", "cites_id": ["4108885579162521107"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4108885579162521107&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ew61GKqxBTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
