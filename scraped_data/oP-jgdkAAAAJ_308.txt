It is not possible to accept that only SST is sufficient to predict the streamflow value. A consensus forecast methodology is proposed with the adjust weights a, b, c, and d to four individual models. Weight increments of 0.02 have been used for all possible combinations. This is a rather mechanical and highly tedious enumeration procedure. However, at this stage more rationalistic approaches could be used. To start with, in the streamflow prediction, available classical literature indicates plausibly that the serial correlation to previous streamflow\u2014ie, the so-called short-term persistence, then the SST, and finally the SOI\u2014play a significant role. Why did the authors not try to enumerate and adjust a, b, c, and d percentage weights in this logical sequence.
