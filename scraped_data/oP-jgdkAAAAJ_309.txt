Dry sediments are collected from two residential catchments on basaltic soils in north-west Melbourne and two residential catchments on sedimentary soils in the eastern part of Melbourne. The data suggest that sediment loads are likely to be higher in the basaltic areas and that the basaltic areas have finer sediments and higher trace metal concentrations associated with the finer sediments. The results imply that stormwater treatment facilities may have to remove more and finer sediments from the basaltic regions in Melbourne compared to the sedimentary regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1693665118420803398", "cites_id": ["1693665118420803398"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.319029029306787", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rh_xp3MbgRcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
