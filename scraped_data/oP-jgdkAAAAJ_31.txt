This paper describes the application of MODHYDROLOG to 28 catchments throughout Australia with different climatic and physical characteristics. Four simulations are carried out on each catchment, the simulations differing in the numbers of model parameters optimized in the model calibration. The study indicates that the use of nine (or fewer) model parameters is sufficient to give adequate estimates of streamflow, and the use of four or five parameters may be sufficient in temperate catchments and in applications where only approximate estimates of runoff are required. MODHYDROLOG is purported to be \u2018physically based\u2019 and this study also indicates that certain model parameters can be related to the catchment characteristics. However, it is difficult to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6823676113677966006", "cites_id": ["6823676113677966006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169494902003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ttoXokWRsl4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 7, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 11, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 11, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
