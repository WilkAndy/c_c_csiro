National Climatic Centre, Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Australia", "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a collective term for the transfer of water, as water vapour, to the atmosphere from both vegetated and unvegetated land surfaces. It is affected by climate, availability of water and vegetation.ET is a large component of the water balance; almost 90 per cent of the precipitation that falls on the Australian continent is returned through ET to the atmosphere. However, despite its importance, ET is almost impossible to measure or observe directly at a meaningful scale in space or time. In the past, surrogate measures, such as evaporation from the US Class A evaporation pan, have been used, with maps of mean monthly and annual pan evaporation published by the Bureau of Meteorology (1988)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17322188703023059162", "cites_id": ["17322188703023059162"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ad38d2f71877dd28f57f7e6fb41fd10e5d9d806d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2lD5N9nGZPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1}}
