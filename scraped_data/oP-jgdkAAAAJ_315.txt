The paper highlights the calibration approach, boundary conditions, modelling problems and the need for more reliable data for improved modelling. Some results from the calibrated model are also presented. The calibrated model will be utilised in the evaluation of management options for water resource development and salinity control in both irrigated and non-irrigated areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14569343185466125557", "cites_id": ["14569343185466125557"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.651873906681292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Wx3fG-0MMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1}}
