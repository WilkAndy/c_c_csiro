Improving the drought resilience of at-risk groundwater systems has been recognized as a priority for sustainable water resources management in the region. This study introduces the standardized groundwater discharge index (SGDI) based on groundwater discharge to river to assess groundwater drought performance at multi-timescales for catchments in the southeastern Murray-Darling Basin. The response time of groundwater drought to precipitation drought is found to be above 12 months according to the relationships between SGDI and the standardized precipitation index. The performance of groundwater drought, indicated by resilience and resistance, overall shows that catchments with higher drought resilience are often \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11269-023-03515-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b2NfL0umfZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
