Data assimilation is now routinely applied by forecasting centres around the world to improve simulations and increase forecast skill. In this work, we are less concerned with the direct benefits of data assimilation on model outputs, but more on the nature of the corrections introduced and how they can be analysed to diagnose structural deficiencies in rainfall-runoff models.Rainfall-runoff models have been shown to lack extrapolation capacity in simulating dry and wet periods that are more extreme than calibration conditions. This is particularly concerning in the context of climate change studies where more climate extremes are generally predicted for expected. This is the case in South-Eastern Australia where annual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/IAHS2022/IAHS2022-365.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
