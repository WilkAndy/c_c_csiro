Some models (IQQM, Source for example) also exist to assess the impacts of human interventions designed to in some way optimise the use of water in regulated river systems. There are however a much smaller number of models designed to assess the impacts of water resources management on socio-economics, the community and the environment more broadly.A current program of work known as MD-WERP\u2013the Murray-Darling Water and Environment Research Program, seeks to improve the understanding and representation of key processes in hydrological models used to underpin basin analysis and planning. We are working with policy makers and water managers in State and Federal government to apply these models to assess the impacts of water resource \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/IAHS2022/IAHS2022-120.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
