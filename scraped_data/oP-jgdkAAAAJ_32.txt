This paper incorporates the remotely-sensed the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer mounted on the polar-orbiting terra satellite-leaf area index (MODIS-LAI) data into Xinanjiang rainfall\u2013runoff model and assesses the model performance on 210 catchments in south-east Australia. The results show that the inclusion of LAI data improves both the model calibration results as well as the daily runoff prediction in ungauged catchments. It is likely that more significant improvements to the model structure to integrate the remotely-sensed vegetation and other data can further reduce the uncertainty in runoff prediction in ungauged catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12094370648465250731", "cites_id": ["12094370648465250731"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169409001504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q5muqwbW16cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 14, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 18, "2020": 15, "2021": 11, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
