Many studies have now shown that traditional application of hydrological models calibrated against past observations will underestimate the range in the projected future hydrological impact, that is, it will underestimate the decline in runoff where a runoff decrease is projected, and underestimate the increase in runoff where a runoff increase is projected. This study opportunistically uses data from south-eastern Australia which recently experienced a long and severe drought lasting more than ten years and subsequent partial hydrological recovery from the drought. The paper shows that a more robust calibration of rainfall-runoff models to produce good calibration metrics in both the dry periods and wet periods, at the expense of the best calibration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23.9014C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
