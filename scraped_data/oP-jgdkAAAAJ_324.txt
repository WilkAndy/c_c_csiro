Given the high climate variability in Australia and the winterdominance of runoff and recharge in southern Australia, these climate trends will have a major impact on water resources in southern and eastern Australia. Groundwater is a major component of drought contingency measures for most areas. Far south-western Australia is already experiencing declining surface and groundwater resources, as a result of climate shifts, and are developing alternative sources of water. Such an obvious trend is expected to be masked for other southern areas by climate variability and only becoming evident during extended drought periods. This talk discusses the current knowledge with respect to risk assessment and management of climate change impacts on Australian groundwater.Any reduction of rainfall is likely to mean amplified reductions in diffuse groundwater recharge. This would imply a reduction in extraction limits and the ability of groundwater to be used in droughts in southern Australia. However, the salinity of many groundwater systems means that most groundwater is not suitable for irrigation and systems are not stressed. currently stressed. Rather than a broad area of groundwater systems in southern Australia being vulnerable to climate change, the spatial pattern of vulnerable systems is more variable. This allows vulnerable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Otman-El-Mountassir/publication/358775472_46th_IAH_Congress_Groundwater_management_and_governance_-_coping_with_water_scarcity/links/6214dc846c472329dcfe0c2d/46th-IAH-Congress-Groundwater-management-and-governance-coping-with-water-scarcity.pdf#page=172", "cites_per_year": {}}
