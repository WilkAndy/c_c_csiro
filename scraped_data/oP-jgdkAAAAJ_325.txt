Too much choice however, results in decisions becoming increasingly daunting and can inhibit the ability to make decisions. Such is often the case when attempting to decide on a suitable response to climate change given the vast number of combinations of global climate models and scenarios. Here we present an example in establishing a tool for assessing future climate risks that upends the paradigm of using global climate models to drive design and decision making. We use a bottom up (also known as decision scaling) framework that focuses on developing an understanding of the system processes through which variability and uncertainties in climate are assessed to guide decision making."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.H53Q1826H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
