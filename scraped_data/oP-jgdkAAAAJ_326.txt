Hydrologists have excelled in developing models for numerous applications, through analysing and interpreting climate and hydrologic data to understand hydrologic processes, conceptualising the processes in hydrological models, and calibrating and testing models against observations. However, interpreting results from these simulations will become more challenging as the models are extrapolated to predict further into the future, where streamflow will be influenced not only by the changes in the input data, but increasingly by higher temperature and changed ecohydrological processes under higher CO 2 not seen in the past."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.H33N2274C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
