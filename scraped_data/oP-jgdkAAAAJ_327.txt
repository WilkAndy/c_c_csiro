These developments may have an impact on water resources and the environment. The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), in partnership with the Department of Environment and Energy, the Bureau of Meteorology and Geoscience Australia, have undertaken a series of\" Bioregional Assessments\" to assess the potential impacts of coal seam gas and coal mining development on water resources and water dependent assets such as wetlands and groundwater bores. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the bioregional assessment results to climate change and hydroclimate variability, using the Gloucester subregion as an example. Specifically, the paper quantifies (i) the relative impact of coal mining development versus impact from potential climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.3984P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
