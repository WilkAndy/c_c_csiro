When various hydrological signatures are identified, it can relatively easy to conduct water resource management, catchment classification and even predicting runoff time series. A runoff signature refers to a distinctive set of runoff or streamflow indices for a catchment at different temporal steps. They include runoff coefficient, zero flow ratio, flow at different percentiles, a measure of runoff seasonality, flow duration curves, etc. This study using three approaches: multiple linear regression, regression tree ensemble, and hydrological modelling to predict thirteen runoff signatures for 605 Australian catchments. The results show that mean annual and high flow signatures can be well predicted by all of the three approaches. But, low flow and flow dynamic signatures are hard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=35342470", "cites_per_year": {}}
