The objectives of the project are to extend unimpaired streamflow data for stations throughout Australia and to relate the model parameters to measurable catchment characteristics. The long time series of streamflow data are important for both research and management of Australia\u2019s hydrological and ecological systems.A simple conceptual daily rainfall-runoff model, SIMHYD, is used to extend the streamflow data. The model estimates streamflow from daily rainfall and areal potential evapotranspiration data. The parameters in the model are first calibrated against the available historical streamflow data. The optimised parameter values are then used to estimate monthly streamflow from 1901-1998."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8006507723775348294", "cites_id": ["8006507723775348294"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d744392f0ba4fb828c59312a0162d2f85a1f7100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rg4Nv1rUHG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 9, "2006": 11, "2007": 11, "2008": 11, "2009": 13, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 12, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
