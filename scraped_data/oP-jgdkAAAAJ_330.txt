In this study, we projected the future possible changes in climate extremes and water hazards across China based on hydrologic simulations driven by Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP). The results indicate that precipitation extremes across China are projected to be more intensive and frequent during the 21st century. Outputs of hydrologic models suggest that the magnitudes of floods are expected to increase during 2070-2099 compared to those during 1971-2000, which are related to the intensifying climate under global warming. Long-term water availability in south China under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8. 5) is projected to decrease compared to those during 1971-2000.
