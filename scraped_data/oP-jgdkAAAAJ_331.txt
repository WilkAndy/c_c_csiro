The South Asian climate is dominated by the summer monsoon as the main source of annual precipitation (Pant and Kumar, 1997). While this is the case for most of the region, the north-west (eg Upper Indus Basin) climate is strongly influenced by western disturbances, with monsoon precipitation a secondary contributor (Dimri et al., 2015). Thus changes in both the monsoon and western disturbances will directly impact South Asian water resources. Additionally, monsoon variability has a strong impact on hydrological response through its influence on mean daily temperatures and vapour pressures, incoming short-wave and long-wave radiation, precipitation frequency, and on wind speeds and directions. Changes in future monsoon onset, duration and intensity will thus not only impact direct hydrological response to precipitation but also glacier melt and accumulation processes (Shea et al., 2015)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5993324230878786889&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SXVFTaKQLFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
