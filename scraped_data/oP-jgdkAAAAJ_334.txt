Over land, ET is a subtle combination of evaporation from the soil (Es), transpiration from plants (Et), and direct evaporation of precipitation intercepted by plants (Ei), an intricate process that has large implications for climate and global change. There are numerous studies focusing on estimating ET and its trends and possible causes. However, no studies have analysed the contribution to these trends of each ET component in detail (Jung et al., 2010, Miralles et al., 2014). This study used gridded global meteorological and satellite data from 1981\u20132012 at 0.50 spatial resolution as inputs to a simple physical model (PML) to compute global terrestrial ET components. The PML model and ET components were validated using a range of observations from point to global scale including: flux tower data, catchment rainfall and streamflow data, global satellitederived soil moisture and vegetation optical depth data. Globally, annual variability in ET estimated from PML falls well within the inter-quantile range of annual variability simulated by nine global land surface models (Figure 1). We find a positive trend in the global ET in the past 30 years, which is mainly driven by vegetation greening trends (Figure 1). The global trend in ET is not significant (p> 0.05) when trends in leaf area index are removed. When the greening trend was included, Et and Ei showed a significant positive trend, but countered by a strong negative trend in Es. We also find that multi-annual variability of Et and Es estimated by the PML model is larger than those from global earth system models.
