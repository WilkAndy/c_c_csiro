This drought was primarily a cool season phenomenon, with large reductions in rainfall observed during the Austral winter (April to October). This reduction in winter rainfall, combined with an absence of wet years and very wet months led to a reduction in streamflow across the region far greater than would be anticipated based on the 12 percent reduction in mean annual rainfall alone. These conditions have proven particularly challenging for water management and planning processes. Our research has linked the extent, duration and severity of this drought to the ongoing observed expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell of 0.5 degrees per decade. This expansion has intensified the sub-tropical ridge over southern Australia, pushing cool season mid-latitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.6657P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
