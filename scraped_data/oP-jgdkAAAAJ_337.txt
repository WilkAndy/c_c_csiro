The models are calibrated using three objective functions that weight high and low flow characteristics differently. The models are calibrated using data from ten unregulated catchments in southeast Australia. The results show that when the GR4J model is calibrated against low flows, it performs better in simulating low flows over an independent period compared to the simulation when using a high-flow objective function but this improvement in simulating low flows comes at the cost of poor simulations of high flows. The simulation results for the Sacramento model are different to GR4J and show that the Sacramento model calibrated specifically against low flows does not necessarily perform better in simulating low flows for an independent period \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.H41D1200V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
