The WIRADA research is focussing on deriving seasonal streamflow forecast using statistical methods that relate streamflow to predictor variables, using dynamic climate-hydrological models and blending forecasts from multiple statistical and dynamic models. Most of the forecast skill currently comes from the antecedent catchment condition, and to significantly improve the seasonal streamflow forecasting skill there needs to be a significant improvement in the rainfall forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology launched a national seasonal streamflow forecasting service underpinned by WIRADA research in December 2010. The positive feedback from the launch provides an opportunity to work with stakeholders to develop and tailor the forecast models directly to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116011&sb=RECENT&n=9&rpp=50&page=51&tr=4054&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:81bb15yvhbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
