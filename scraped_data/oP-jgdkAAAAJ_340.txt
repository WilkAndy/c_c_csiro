Hence there is a need for robust methods for undertaking water resource assessments to underpin the sustainable management of water in tropical regions. A key characteristic of wet-dry tropical environments is that the high flows occur over several wet months and there is a long dry season with periods of low-or no-flow. The dry-season flows are important for water dependent ecosystems and consumptive water use. It is a challenge to accurately estimate runoff in tropical regions because these areas typically have a relatively low density of hydrometerological data. While many studies have tested different hydrological similarity methods for modelling runoff in ungauged mediterranean and temperate catchments, few have tested such methods in tropical regions or for simulating low-flows.
