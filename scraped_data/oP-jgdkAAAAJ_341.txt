With climate change projections suggesting changes in future rainfall magnitude and intensity, groundwater recharge in semi-arid areas is likely to be affected disproportionately by climate change. This study sought to investigate projected changes in episodic recharge in arid areas of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, using three global warming scenarios from 15 different global climate models (GCMs) for a 2030 climate. Two metrics were used to investigate episodic recharge: at the annual scale the coefficient of variation was used, and at the daily scale the proportion of recharge in the highest 1% of daily recharge. The metrics were proportional to each other but were inconclusive as to whether episodic recharge was to increase or decrease in this environment; this is not a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-011-0804-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n3u8BxPZRfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
