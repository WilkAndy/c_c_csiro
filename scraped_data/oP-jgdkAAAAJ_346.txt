Using data from 105 catchments in tropical Australia, five daily rainfall-runoff models and three methods of regionalising model parameters were compared. Under prediction mode there was no difference in model performance. The adoption of multiple-criteria to select an optimal parameter set resulted in an improved ability to simulate low flows, with no loss in predictive capacity for higher flows. An educated transposition of \u2018intact\u2019 parameter sets between gauged and ungauged catchments was better than random assignment of \u2018intact\u2019 model parameter sets, while assigning model parameter sets on the basis of spatial proximity out-performed physical similarity methods.
