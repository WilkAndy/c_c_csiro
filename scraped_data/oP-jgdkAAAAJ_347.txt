As part of this project, this study quantifies the relative uncertainty in modelled change in runoff sourced from Global Climate Models (GCMs) and rainfall-runoff models in the context of this large region. The result will lead to improved hydroclimate projections for climate change impact studies. Large-scale climate impact studies usually use conceptual rainfall-runoff models with the future climate projections from GCMs to estimate the impact on future water availability. Five widely used lumped conceptual daily rainfall-runoff models, Sacramento, SIMHYD, SMARG, IHACRES and AWBM are chosen for this study. They are first assessed for their ability in reproducing observed runoff and then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.H51A0848T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
