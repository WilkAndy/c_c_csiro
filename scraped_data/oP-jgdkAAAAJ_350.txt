In this study, we explore whether we can improve catchment evaporation and runoff estimates by incorporating remote sensing land cover type data in the Fu rational function model (adaptation of the Budyko curve). We carried out the study using daily meteorological data from across the Murray-Darling Basin and fractional land cover type data obtained from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), and calibrated the modified Fu model against streamflow data from 115 relatively unimpaired and unregulated catchments. The results suggest that using land cover type data in the rational function Fu model can improve \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongqiang-Zhang-15/publication/291347545_Inclusion_of_vegetation_types_in_estimating_catchment_mean_annual_evaporation_and_runoff/links/56a16a2408ae27f7de266c83/Inclusion-of-vegetation-types-in-estimating-catchment-mean-annual-evaporation-and-runoff.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
