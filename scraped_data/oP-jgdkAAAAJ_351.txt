Two applications of MODIS-LAI with the SIMHYD lumped conceptual daily rainfall-runoff model were explored. In the first application, SIMHYD was calibrated against both the observed streamflow and ERS. In the second application, SIMHYD was modified to use MODIS-LAI data directly. Data from 2001 to 2005 from 120 catchments in south-east Australia were used for the study, where runoff for each catchment was estimated using the optimized parameter values from the geographically closest calibration catchment. The results indicate that the SIMHYD calibration against both the observed streamflow and ERS produced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.H21K..08Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
