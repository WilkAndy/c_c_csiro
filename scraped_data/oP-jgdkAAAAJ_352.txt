For such a conceptualization, at the cessation of a transient hydrological disturbance of any magnitude the model will return to the same stable state, and thus show an infinite resilience. To highlight and challenge this assumption a numerical distributed eco-hydrological model (coupled hillslope Boussinesq-vertically lumped vadose zone) was developed in which qualitatively different steady state water table elevations exist for the same parameter set. The multiple steady states are shown to emerge from a positive feedback arising from a reduction in leaf area index (LAI) and, thus, transpiration, as a saline water table approaches the surface. Limit cycle continuation (LCC) was undertaken to quantify the state \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.H11K..01A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
