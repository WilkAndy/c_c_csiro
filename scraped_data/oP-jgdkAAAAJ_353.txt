The aim of these projects is to produce transparent, consistent and robust information on current and future water availability in order to properly manage and share limited water resources in four regions across Australia: the Murray-Darling Basin, Tasmania, Southwest Western Australia, and Northern Australia. Deriving these water availabilities is made more difficult by the fact that most catchments in the study regions are ungauged. As a result, a technique needs be derived to predict the hydrologic response of these ungauged catchments. For the Australian Sustainable Yields Projects, a decision was made to calibrate rainfall-runoff models to gauged catchments and predict the hydrologic response of nearby ungauged catchments through hydrologic regionalisation techniques.
