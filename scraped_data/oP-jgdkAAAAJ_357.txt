This paper describes an ensemble modelling approach used to estimate runoff for 0.05 ox 0.05 o grid cells (~ 5 km x 5 km) across southeast Australia. There are about 250 \u2018unimpaired\u2019streamflow gauging stations with more than 50 percent data from 1975 to 2006, and they cover less than 1 percent of the over one million square kilometres study region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/iemssconference/2008/all/255/", "cites_per_year": {}}
