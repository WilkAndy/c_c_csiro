If a single stable state is assumed, a transient hydrological disturbance of any magnitude will result in a return of the model to the same stable state, and thus show an infinite resilience. In an attempt to make this assumption less implicit, a numerical hydrological model is presented in which this assumption is violated.The impetus for the model derives from the concept of ecosystem resilience (referred to hence forth as resilience)(Walker et al. 2004). It is a concept, derived from dynamic systems theory, in which biophysical environments are considered to have multiple possible equilibria (hence forth attractors) for the same parameters and within each one, the system stochastically moves. For a sufficient transient disturbance the system may cross a threshold (hence forth repeller) and move into an alternate, and possible socially undesirable, equilibrium. The only quantitative catchment-resilience model is that of Anderies (2005) and extended by Peterson et al.(2005). This model, which is an annual time step, salt and water, groundwaterunsaturated zone lumped model of the Goulburn catchment (Victoria, Australia), predicts it to have two coexistent equilibria. As a result of widespread land clearing it predicts one of the equilibria to have been lost and the catchment to have only the state of near-zero depth to groundwater remaining."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.gbcma.vic.gov.au/downloads/wshop_resilience_reading/Multiple_Stable_Hydrological_States_in_Models.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zlQ_oYBJWGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
