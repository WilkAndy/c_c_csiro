One of the goals of the Climate Variability Program in the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology (CRCCH) is to provide modellers with computer programs to facilitate the generation of stochastic climate data. This paper describes the Stochastic Climate Library (SCL) - a library of stochastic models for generating climate data. SCL is a model/software product in the CRCCH Modelling Toolkit, and can be downloaded from www.toolkit.net.au. The stochastic models in SCL are reliable and robust, and have been successfully tested using data from across Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.975988755061886", "cites_per_year": {}}
