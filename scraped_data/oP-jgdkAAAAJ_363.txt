The main product is a historical time series of soil moisture for any point in Australia (25x25 km grid) and probabilistic forecasts of soil moisture conditions up to 12 months ahead. The soil moisture information is of interest to a wide range of stakeholders and is crucial for making realistic decisions on land and water resources management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.976324148544533", "cites_per_year": {}}
