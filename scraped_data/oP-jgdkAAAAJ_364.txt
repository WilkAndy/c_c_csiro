It is a resource for the land and water management industry and the research and development community supporting that industry. The purpose of the Toolkit is to enable multiple predictions of land and water management decisions at whole-of-catchment scale. Its use will enable land and water managers to manage catchments better, leading to improved environmental, economic and social outcomes for Australia.  The Catchment Modelling Toolkit contains model and data products that are professionally produced in a standard manner. These products can be used independently to simulate particular processes, or integrated to model whole-of-catchment scale responses.
