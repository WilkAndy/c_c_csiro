Melbourne is the second largest city in Australia with a population of over three million. Streamflow and reservoir inflow data from seven water supply catchments and rainfall data from 18 stations are used in this study. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is used to identify cycles in the long rainfall and flow time series. The EMD analysis is also applied to bootstrap samples from the original time series to test the statistical significance of the identified cycles. In EMD analysis, a time series is decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions that are mutually independent. The decomposition is based on the direct extraction of energy (variance) associated with various intrinsic time scales that are automatically and adaptively selected from the time series. The EMD is a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AGUFM.H24B..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
