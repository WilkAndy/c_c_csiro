Estimates of pollutant loads and understanding of pollutant characteristics are required to design treatment methods to reduce pollution loads in urban waterways and receiving waters. This paper presents results from the analyses of particle size distribution and size distribution of TSS, TP and TN for samples collected at various times through one storm event in a residential catchment north-west of Melbourne. The results indicate that the sediment and size distribution of TP are coarsest in the rising limb of the hydrograph, but no trend in the size distribution of TN through the storm. The first flush effect is evident in this storm where pollutant concentrations are highest in the rising limb of the hydrograph. However, most of the loads are transported by the big discharges. The results here indicate that targeting the rising limb and the peak runoff of the event \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.359853869333503", "cites_per_year": {}}
