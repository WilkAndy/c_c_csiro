In this study, an , automatic, multi-structured hydrological modelling scheme has been developed with the aim of providing multiple alternative descriptions of hydrological processes. For example, alternative descriptions include saturation excess and partial interception storage-discharge relationships, the Xinanjiang distribution approach (i.e. VIC model) and Linear Transfer Function (i.e. IHACRES). The modelling suite is used to trial all permutations of model structure and complexity for 188 catchments from across NSW. To assess the performance of the different model structures, the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency was applied to all catchments regardless of the governing hydrological processes. The results indicate that of 60 model permutations a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.358791789971785", "cites_per_year": {}}
