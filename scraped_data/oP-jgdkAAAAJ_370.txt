This will lead to changes in precipitation patterns and other climate variables. Changes in precipitation are usually amplified in runoff. Higher temperatures increase potential evapotranspiration, which may lead to a reduction in runoff and soil moisture levels. These changes are likely to require a significant planning response to land and water resources design and management. This paper outlines the process undertaken to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the security of the Coliban Water Supply System in north central Victoria and discusses the implications on management of the system. A REALM network model of the system was used to compare security of supply in 30 years time under existing climate conditions and predicted climate change conditions.
