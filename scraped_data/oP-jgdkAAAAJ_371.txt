It is not possible to accept that only SST is sufficient to predict the streamflow value. A consensus forecast methodology is proposed with the adjust weights a, b, c, and d to four individual models. Weight increments of 0.02 have been used for all possible combinations. This is a rather mechanical and highly tedious enumeration procedure. However, at this stage more rationalistic approaches could be used. To start with, in the streamflow prediction, available classical literature indicates plausibly that the serial correlation to previous streamflow\u2014ie, the so-called short-term persistence, then the SST, and finally the SOI\u2014play a significant role. Why did the authors not try to enumerate and adjust a, b, c, and d percentage weights in this logical sequence. On the other hand, since this is an optimization procedure, it is possible to evaluate the LEPS scores for all possible combinations by the use of any systematic optimization method or genetic algorithm. Furthermore, since the model structure is not needed, the authors could also use an artificial neural networks approach in the prediction procedure. In such an approach, weightings could be automatically obtained by using the actual streamflow, SOI, and SST data for training. The calculation of streamflow risks is possible only within the ranges of the historical data. However, the question of risks at 10, 25, 50, 100, and 500-year recurrence intervals could not be answered easily. How could one calculate the risks of streamflow values that are likely to occur \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdusselam-Altunkaynak/publication/245287363_Discussion_of_Development_of_Exceedance_Probability_Streamflow_Forecast_by_Thomas_C_Piechota_Francis_H_S_Chiew_John_A_Dracup_and_Thomas_A_McMahon/links/5a7c37fe458515d353314270/Discussion-of-Development-of-Exceedance-Probability-Streamflow-Forecast-by-Thomas-C-Piechota-Francis-H-S-Chiew-John-A-Dracup-and-Thomas-A-McMahon.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rKFb271TK8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
