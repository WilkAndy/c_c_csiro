The main outcome of the project is time series streamflow data from 1901 to 1998 for 286 catchments across Australia. The modelling is carried out for 331 catchments but monthly streamflow data are extended only for 286 catchments where simulations are considered satisfactory. The streamflow data are extended using the simple daily conceptual rainfall-runoff model SIMHYD which estimates streamflow from rainfall and areal potential evapotranspiration data. The parameters in SIMHYD are calibrated against historical streamflow data, and the optimised parameter values are used to estimate streamflow from 1901 to 1998. The long time series streamflow data are important for both research and management of Australia's hydrological and ecological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.319588018444533", "cites_per_year": {}}
