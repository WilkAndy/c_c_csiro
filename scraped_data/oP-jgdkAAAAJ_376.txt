An exceedance probability forecast is important for the design and operation of water resource systems, that require a high degree of system reliability. Past studies have shown that the hydrology in these regions is strongly effected by ENSO. The relationship is strong enough to develop a seasonal streamflow forecast in both of these regions. In eastern and south-eastern Australia, there is a strong tendency for below normal hydrologic conditions following an El Ni\u00f1o event. In the western U.S., the potential of making a six-month lead time forecast of spring-summer runoffis demonstrated for the Columbia River basin. The skill associated with these forecasts is better than the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/40517(2000)235", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QfCXBtLbuSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
