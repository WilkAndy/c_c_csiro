The modelling results for several catchments in Australian capital cities are presented. The study indicates that long-term and daily runoff can be estimated reasonably accurately using simple approaches. However, the water quality characteristic can vary considerably between catchments, and in the absence of data, the models can only provide a guide to the probable range of diffuse pollution load generated from a catchment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17496766338160865399&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dzAXYEgA0fIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
