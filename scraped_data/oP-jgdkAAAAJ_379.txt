In particular, estimates of precipitation and runoff are important for the management of water resources and to evaluate the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water resources. The precipitation and runoff estimated by the CSIR09 GCM for three large river basins are compared with the observed values. The comparisons indicate that the GCM can provide reasonable estimates of the mean annual precipitation but cannot consistently estimate the temporal distribution through the year for all areas of the globe. The GCM also gives reasonable long-term estimates of runoff for wet and temperate catchments. However, GCM simulations of long-term runoff for dry and ephemeral catchments are extremely poor."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.360510135116819", "cites_per_year": {}}
