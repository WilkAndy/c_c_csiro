This paper investigates the use of seasonal streamflow forecasts to help manage three water resources systems in south-east Australia. The seasonal streamflow forecasts are derived from the serial correlation in streamflow and the relationship between El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and streamflow. This paper investigates the use of ENSO and serial correlation in reservoir inflow to optimise water restriction rules for an urban township and the use of seasonal forecasts of reservoir inflow to help make management decisions in two irrigation systems. The results show a marginal benefit in using seasonal streamflow forecasts in the three management examples. The results suggest that although the ENSO\u2013streamflow teleconnection and the serial correlation in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 156, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10150132426962824013", "cites_id": ["10150132426962824013"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169402002925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TetKJKqD3IwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 15, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
