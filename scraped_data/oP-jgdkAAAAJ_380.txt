The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is generally considered as the strongest indicator of ENS0 for east Australia. This paper examines the links between SOI and rainfall, Palmer Drought Severity Index and streamflow. The 24-month ENSO composites of the data are fitted through the first harmonic to determine regions with similar phase shifts in the harmonic fit. Two types of analyses are then carried out using data values averaged over eight regions of Australia - season detection analysis to identify successive months with below-normal anomalies and correlation analysis of the three hydroclimatic variables and SOI values several months before. The results indicate that ENSO can be associated with drought in Australia. They also suggest that SOI values can be used with some success to forecast hydroclimatic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.362280267386348", "cites_per_year": {}}
