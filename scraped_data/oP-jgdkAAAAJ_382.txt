This paper investigates the implications of the length of available historical streamflow records on reservoir storage and capital costs of construction. It is shown that the overyear storage estimates derived from sequential storage analysis will generally be larger if longer sequences are used for analysis compared with shorter sequences. As such, the sequence length used for analysis should be equal to the relevant design life rather than the length of available record. For a given design life and using simulations based on generation of synthetic streamflow sequences, the paper also shows how dollar values can be estimated for increments in streamflow data records based on reduced expected capital costs of storage construction resulting from reduction in uncertainty."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.748485862189398", "cites_per_year": {}}
