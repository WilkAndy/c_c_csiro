As direct measurement of recharge is extremely difficult, recharge is usually estimated indirectly. This paper describes the use of five modelling techniques to estimate recharge for the dryland and irrigation areas in the Campaspe River Basin in north-central Victoria. The recharge estimates are presented and the applicability and relative merits of the modelling methods are discussed. The recharge estimates improve as the sophistication of the model increases with the model simulating simultaneously both the surface and groundwater processes, as well as their interactions, giving the most reliable spatial and temporal estimates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.437128912930537", "cites_per_year": {}}
