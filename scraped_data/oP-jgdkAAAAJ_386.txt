It has been found that catalysts without zinc oxide initially have higher activity but then deactivate whilst catalysts promoted with zinc oxide have lower activities which are stable. The effect of zinc loading on the copper surface has also been investigated. These results show that the activity of the catalyst surface passes through a minimum with increasing zinc oxide loading."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.840402309406098", "cites_per_year": {}}
