A brief description is given of the integrated surface and groundwater modelling approach used to estimate regional recharge rates and presents the recharge rates estimated for the Campaspe River Basin. The integrated model is a powerful management tool as it can predict the relationship between rainfall, irrigation, recharge and rises in the watertable levels. The model predicted that approximately 15 percent of irrigation water recharges the shallow aquifer. Approximately 6 percent of rainfall contributes to recharge in the irrigated areas while 4 to 5 percent of rainfall becomes recharge in the dryland areas. Rainfall makes a greater contribution in the irrigation areas compared to the dryland areas because irrigation predisposes the soil to recharge from rainfall. The watertable levels in the irrigation areas are currently rising at approximately 0.14 m per year. This rate of rise will increase faster than the increase in irrigation applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9401331", "cites_per_year": {}}
