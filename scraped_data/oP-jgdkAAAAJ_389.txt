The parameters in HYDROLOG were fitted to minimize a streamflow objective function. The model can thus provide accurate recharge estimates only if the parameters to which the recharge estimates are sensitive are also those to which the streamflow objective function is sensitive, otherwise recharge estimates will remain unchanged as the parameters which influence the streamflow objective function are progressively altered to reduce the value of the objective function. Analyses were carried out in a catchment area in northern Victoria, Australia, to guide further improvements in the model and to investigate the sensitivity of the objective function and the recharge estimates to the parameters in HYDROLOG, using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13237517451497323173&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
