Modelling was carried out in both the irrigated and non-irrigated areas in the northern half of the Campaspe River Basin in north-central Victoria. The second subject of this paper is on the analyses of errors in the recharge estimates due to errors in the input data. Random and normally distributed errors are applied to the original data set, and the analyses carried out to investigate the significance of these errors on the recharge estimates. The modelling results and error analyses indicate that this modelling approach can be used successfully to predict recharge rates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.651855273710034", "cites_per_year": {}}
