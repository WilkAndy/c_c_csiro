This loss of surface water inflow, due to a drying climate, has raised awareness amongst water planners of climate change and potential water shortages affecting cities and irrigation areas across southern Australia. This article discusses the role of groundwater in response to climate change in Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://henry.baw.de/bitstreams/78c19024-344d-45dd-bcd6-6a1af6bf2992/download", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qaZXjKgk-BYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
