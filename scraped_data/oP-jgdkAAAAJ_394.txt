The term parameterization refers to functional relationships that describe the processes being modelled. A significant number of studies are dedicated to the evaluation of these schemes using observations at point, regional or global scale. The approach of these studies ranges from fully coupled land surface-atmospheric circulation models to off-line model simulations using driving atmospheric forcings at a reference level close to the surface.The land surface model developed by Viterbo and Beljaars (1995)(VB95) is used in the NWP models of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Models like VB95 have been developed with a focus on land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy as required in simulations of weather and climate in atmospheric models. While runoff is predicted, it is not generally used operationally and typically receives little emphasis in the modelling effort. However, because such models are routinely run by weather agencies around the world, they provide comprehensive simulations of hydrologic response at spatial scales down to about 100 km2. These simulations provide a real-time estimate of the hydrologic state of our landscapes along with current and forecast runoff, albeit of questionable accuracy. With appropriate improvements to the modelling, such a product could be provided by the Bureau of Meteorology and would find many beneficial uses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=913ea59d9da2ee29a357e2c9f81b83b22c72fd12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b0eEXPw-J6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
