It will allow informed and accurate decisions about forestry, agriculture and conservation strategies. To date this goal has eluded hydrological modellers. The majority of attempts have been centred around regionalisation of model parameters\u2013finding an \u2018optimum\u2019parameter set, and correlating parameter values against catchment physical characteristics. This study will use an uncertainty estimation method coupled with Bayesian model averaging to utilise the concept of \u2018equifinality\u2019\u2013that there is no optimum parameter set. This will enable more informative and accurate calibration of models, and thus successful estimation of streamflow in ungauged catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10611602934713217469&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vfESfaX8Q5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
