For example, the initiation of moist convection can be heavily influenced by the distribution of soil moisture in the region (Pielke Sr., 2001; Weaver and Avissar, 2001). Numerical experiments have shown that the soil moisture pattern over Victoria can alter the movement of wind shift lines significantly (Mills, 1995), which, in an Australian context, is particularly relevant for the prediction of fire behaviour some hours ahead. Fog and low cloud prediction, as another threshold process, is also very sensitive to the surface fluxes controlled by soil moisture (Bergot and Guedalia, 1994).About three years ago the Australian Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre (BMRC) adopted the Viterbo and Beljaars (1995)(hereafter VB95) land surface scheme in order to replace the previously used bucket scheme. Plans are now under way to introduce VB95 into all numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models in use at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). Although VB95 has been tested extensively in various climatic regimes, its performance under Australian climate, soil and vegetation conditions is unknown. With significant efforts in progress for obtaining Australian soil moisture and soil temperature time series, we are now in a position to carry out the required verification efforts. This article first provides a brief description of the operational NWP model suite at the BOM, followed by a description of VB95.
