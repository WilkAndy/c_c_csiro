A method is presented for estimating daily runoff from daily rainfall data using the AWBM model, which self-calibrates its surface storage parameters to the estimate of average annual runoff from the regressions, and using default values for its baseflow parameters. Two-thirds of the estimates of average annual runoff were within \u00b125% of the actual value. The approach can also estimate satisfactorily the monthly and annual runoff series in many catchments, with the simulations being only slightly poorer than those obtained by directly calibrating the AWBM against recorded runoff."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11999906032655126754", "cites_id": ["11999906032655126754"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481520600051X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4tB5XvU6iKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 11, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
