The methods were tested at reproducing a range of statistics important within hydrological studies including inter-annual variability and spatial coherency using both NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and GCM predictors, thus testing the validity of GCM downscaled predictions. The methods evaluated, all having found application in Australia previously, are: (1) the dynamical downscaling Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) of McGregor (2005); the historical data based (2) Scaling method applied by Chiew et al. (2009) and (3) Analogue method of Timbal (2004); and three stochastic methods, (4) the GLIMCLIM (Generalised Linear Model for daily Climate time series) software package (Chandler, 2002), (5) the Non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (NHMM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1026237815576933589", "cites_id": ["1026237815576933589"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411004525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1TSJJNvtPQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 17, "2014": 17, "2015": 19, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 16, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
