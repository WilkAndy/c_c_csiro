This newly developed methodology takes persistence, an ENSO indicator, and several Pacific/Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) series as the main predictor variables. Using linear discriminant analysis, the forecast is expressed as probability of exceedance of continuous streamflow amounts. An exceedance probability forecast is continuous and is useful for the design and operation of water resource systems, which require a high degree of system reliability. Application of the forecast model to five Australian catchments shows that persistence is the most important predictor of streamflow for the next season. The other predictors, SSTs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11218372628095254894", "cites_id": ["11218372628095254894"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2001)6:1(20)", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bkGVv3eqr5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 8, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 11, "2008": 1, "2009": 13, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 12, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
