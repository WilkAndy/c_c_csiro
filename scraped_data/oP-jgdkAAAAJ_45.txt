The model is a simplified version of the HYDROLOG (SIMHYD) model, which is used to estimate runoff in ungauged catchments. Two applications were explored:(i) the calibration of SIMHYD against both the observed streamflow and E RS, and (ii) the modification of SIMHYD to use MODIS LAI data directly. Data from 2001 to 2005 from 120 catchments in southeast Australia were used for the study. To assess the modeling results for ungauged catchments, optimized parameter values from the geographically nearest gauged catchment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8988876826392250898", "cites_id": ["8988876826392250898"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/10/4/2009jhm1061_1.xml?tab_body=pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EsrZNtnnvnwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
