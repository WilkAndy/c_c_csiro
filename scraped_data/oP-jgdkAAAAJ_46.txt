Recent reductions in runoff have been unprecedented in the historical record. We test annual time series of rainfall and runoff from 1895 to 2006 for the presence of step changes and trends in order to place recent years in the context of the historical record, and characterise the severity of the recent low rainfall and runoff using average recurrence intervals. The largest signal identified in historical rainfall and runoff is a step-change increase in rainfall and runoff occurring in the mid-1940s. However, other dry periods comparable to the recent dry sequence are evident in the historical record, particularly at the beginning of the 20th century and around 1936\u20131945. The recent reduction in rainfall and runoff is most severe in the southernmost parts of the MDB, with the runoff reduction being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6700439094261785538", "cites_id": ["6700439094261785538"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169409007458", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wiOdFNu9_FwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 18, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 13, "2017": 5, "2018": 15, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
