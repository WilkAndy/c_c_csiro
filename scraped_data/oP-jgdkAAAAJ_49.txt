The results show runoff decline in southeast and far southwest Australia, but elsewhere across the continent there is no clear agreement between the global climate models in the direction of future precipitation and runoff change. Averaged across large regions, the estimates from the Budyko and Fu equations are reasonably similar to those from the hydrological models. The simplicity of the Budyko equation, the similarity in the results, and the large uncertainty in global climate model projections of future precipitation suggest that the Budyko equation is suitable for estimating climate change impact on mean annual runoff across large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10139201075165328411", "cites_id": ["10139201075165328411"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/13/3/jhm-d-11-097_1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G_R8d6ittYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 20, "2016": 3, "2017": 13, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 16, "2021": 18, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
