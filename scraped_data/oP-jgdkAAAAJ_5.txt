This paper presents data on surface pollutant characteristics on an urban road surface in Melbourne, Australia, from samples collected over a 36 day period. The data indicate that buildup over the dry days occurs relatively quickly after a rain event, but slows down after several days as redistribution occurs. The surface pollutant also becomes finer over the dry days as it is disintegrated. The washoff of surface pollutant is dependent on the rainfall and runoff characteristics, but the results here show that common storms only remove a small proportion of the total surface pollutant load. The data also show that street sweeping may have an adverse impact on pollutant washoff because the street sweeper releases the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 436, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2803028419512150058", "cites_id": ["2803028419512150058"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462075802000274", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KqhYGH9b5iYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 13, "2006": 18, "2007": 26, "2008": 20, "2009": 22, "2010": 22, "2011": 18, "2012": 30, "2013": 24, "2014": 32, "2015": 36, "2016": 36, "2017": 28, "2018": 23, "2019": 18, "2020": 25, "2021": 11, "2022": 17, "2023": 3}}
