The focus of this paper is the identification of catchment attributes and optimization of a similarity measure to produce the best possible ungauged streamflow predictions given a data set and a conceptual model structure. As a case study, the SimHyd rainfall\u2010runoff model is applied to simulate monthly streamflow in 184 Australian catchments. Initial results show that none of 27 catchment attributes can be safely said to consistently give a better ensemble of models than random selection when used independently of other attributes. This is contrary to prior expectations and indicates the sparseness of information within our database of catchments, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14560924927657304881", "cites_id": ["14560924927657304881"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008WR007248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MeMkGhPMEsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 12, "2015": 5, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 8}}
