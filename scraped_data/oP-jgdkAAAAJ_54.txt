Event pollutant loads are typically estimated using either regression equations or \u201cprocess\u2010based\u201d water quality models. The relative merit of using regression models compared to process\u2010based models is not clear. A modeling study is carried out here to evaluate the comparative ability of the regression equations and process\u2010based water quality models to estimate event diffuse pollutant loads from impervious surfaces. The results indicate that, once calibrated, both the regression equations and the process\u2010based model can estimate event pollutant loads satisfactorily. In fact, the loads estimated using the regression equation as a function of rainfall intensity and runoff rate are better than the loads estimated using the process\u2010based model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1270805944752312110", "cites_id": ["1270805944752312110"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002WR001788", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lo9qE0bPohEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 9, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
