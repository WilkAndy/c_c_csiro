Such a function might be based on maximising the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency or the correlation coefficient or by minimising the root mean square error. Other modellers routinely incorporate a bias constraint into their objective function. There are a number of ways of incorporating a bias constraint. One way is to accept a calibration only if the difference in total streamflow between observation and prediction is less than some prescribed limit. Typically, this limit might be expressed as a percentage of the total observed streamflow. In this paper we examine whether the choice of calibration method\u2014using a bias constraint or not\u2014has an effect on the subsequent use of the calibrated parameter sets to regionalise predictions to ungauged catchments. We calibrate five lumped rainfall-runoff models\u2014AWBM, IHACRES, Sacramento, Simhyd and SMAR-G\u2014to 89 gauged catchments in Tasmania ranging in size from 10 to 3500 km2. Three separate calibration runs are done for each model. In one, the objective function is based on the daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency alone; in the second, we augment the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency with a severe bias constraint that attempts to ensure that the total predicted streamflow is within 5% of the total observed streamflow (the bucket constraint); and in the third, we combine a smooth, less severe bias constraint (the log-bias constraint) along with efficiency into the objective function. As expected, overall efficiencies tend to be larger for the unconstrained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18021981630871289216", "cites_id": ["18021981630871289216"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7638de77fc6bf05f40e320d476993b5548448cc6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gL2yCM_wGvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
