Existing diagnostic models have different focus on either water or carbon flux estimates with various model complexity and uncertainties induced by distinct representation of the coupling between water and carbon processes. Here, we propose a diagnostic model to estimate evapotranspiration and gross primary production that is based on biophysical mechanism yet simple for practical use. This is done by coupling the carbon and water fluxes via canopy conductance used in the Penman\u2013Monteith\u2013Leuning equation (named as PML_V2 model). The PML_V2 model takes Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer leaf area index and meteorological variables as inputs. The model was tested \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10025706723381712823", "cites_id": ["10025706723381712823"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1974", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t5dpfSV3IosJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 28, "2022": 33, "2023": 18}}
