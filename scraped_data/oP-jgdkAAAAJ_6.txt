The modelling experiments are carried out for four rainfall\u2013runoff models using long records of historical daily climate and streamflow data from 61 catchments in southeast Australia. The results indicate that the models, when calibrated using more than 20years of data, can generally be used for climate impact studies where the future mean annual rainfall is not more than 15% drier or 20% wetter than the mean annual rainfall in the model calibration period. It is generally more difficult for a model calibrated over a wet period to predict runoff over a dry period compared to a model calibrated over a dry period to predict runoff over a wet period.
