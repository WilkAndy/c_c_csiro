While future streamflows are mainly dependent on initial catchment states and future rainfall, use of the rainfall\u2010runoff models together with estimated future rainfall can produce skilful forecasts of future streamflows. This is the basis for the ensemble streamflow prediction system, but this approach has not been explored in Australia. In this paper, two conceptual rainfall\u2010runoff models, together with rainfall ensembles or analogues based on historical rainfall and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), were used to forecast streamflows at monthly and 3\u2010monthly scales at two catchments in east Australia. The results showed that both models forecast monthly streamflow well when forecasts for all months were evaluated together, but their performance varied \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4157716877244885122", "cites_id": ["4157716877244885122"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010WR009922", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gujTqHgtszkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
