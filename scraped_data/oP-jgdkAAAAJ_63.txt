However, there are lack of comprehensive evaluations of various approaches for predicting hydrological signatures. This study, for the first time, introduces regression tree ensemble approach and compares it with other three widely used approaches (multiple linear regression, multiple log\u2010transformed linear regression, and hydrological modeling) for assessing prediction accuracy of 13 runoff characteristics or signatures, using a large data set from 605 catchments across Australia. The climate, in particular, mean annual precipitation and aridity index, has the most significant influence on the runoff signatures. Physical catchment attributes including forest ratio, slope, and soil water holding capacity also have significant influence (p < 0.05) on the runoff signatures. All four approaches can predict the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16461485918674276210", "cites_id": ["16461485918674276210"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018WR023325", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cs-s8TnycuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 15, "2021": 19, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
