This paper compares and discusses the applicability of Penman's potential evapotranspiration estimates and Morton's wet environment evapotranspiration estimates in rainfall\u2010runoff modeling applications. Morton's wet environment evapotranspiration depends only on the atmospheric variables and is the estimate of evapotranspiration that would occur when water supply is not limiting. It is a conceptually more correct representation of the upper constraint on actual evapotranspiration compared to Penman's potential evapotranspiration which is dependent on the water supply to the soil\u2010plant surfaces. Although Penman's potential evapotranspiration and Morton's wet environment evapotranspiration are two different quantities, comparison of the two estimates using data from different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6504885990868872644,8335944943462233567", "cites_id": ["6504885990868872644", "8335944943462233567"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1991.tb01462.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xG0nJlj_RVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
