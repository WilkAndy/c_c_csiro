In this study, inter- and intra-basin patterns of flood variability are examined for catchments east of Australia\u2019s Great Dividing Range. Three measures of flood variability are explored with uncertainty quantified using bootstrap resampling. The two preferred measures of flood variability (namely a flood quantile ratio and a power law scaling coefficient) produced similar results. Catchments in the wet tropics of far north Queensland experience low flood variability. Flood variability increased southwards through Queensland, reaching a maximum in the vicinity of the Fitzroy and Burnett River basins. The small near-coast catchments of southern Queensland and northern New Wales experience \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7211903429192294955", "cites_id": ["7211903429192294955"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169409003242", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K6JtY_XTFWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
