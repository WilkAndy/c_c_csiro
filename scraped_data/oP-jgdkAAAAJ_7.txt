The future climate series is obtained by scaling the historical series, informed by 15 global climate models (GCMs), to reflect a 0.9\u00b0C increase in global average surface air temperature, using a daily scaling method that considers changes in the future mean seasonal rainfall and potential evapotranspiration as well as in the daily rainfall distribution. The majority of the modeling results indicate that there will be less runoff in southeast Australia in the future. However, there is considerable uncertainty, with the results ranging from a 17% decrease to a 7% increase in the mean annual runoff averaged across the study area for the 0.9\u00b0C global warming. The model assessments indicate that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 392, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2061728720351077027", "cites_id": ["2061728720351077027"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008wr007338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oyK__1i7nBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 17, "2011": 29, "2012": 40, "2013": 36, "2014": 30, "2015": 35, "2016": 21, "2017": 27, "2018": 33, "2019": 23, "2020": 22, "2021": 30, "2022": 31, "2023": 9}}
