It can help in water resource management, catchment classification, and prediction of runoff time series. This study investigated three approaches for predicting six hydrological signatures in southeastern Australia. These approaches were (1) spatial interpolation with three weighting schemes, (2) index model that estimates hydrological signatures using catchment characteristics, and (3) classical rainfall\u2013runoff modelling. The six hydrological signatures fell into two categories: (1) long-term aggregated signatures \u2013 annual runoff coefficient, mean of log-transformed daily runoff, and zero flow ratio, and (2) signatures obtained from daily flow metrics \u2013 concavity index, seasonality ratio of runoff, and standard deviation of log-transformed daily flow.
