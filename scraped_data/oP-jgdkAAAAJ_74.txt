The median projection shows increases in mean annual runoff of 20\u201330% in the Indian sub-continent for 2046\u20132075 relative to 1976\u20132005. The change in runoff is driven mainly by the change in precipitation, moderated (in wetter futures) or intensified (in drier futures) by higher temperature and potential evaporation. The paper also investigates the uncertainties of the projection due to scaling methods and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1366050975230339030", "cites_id": ["1366050975230339030"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581817304573", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1ieu0x8w9RIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 14, "2021": 18, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
