This paper investigates the implications of different rainfall inputs on the calibration and simulation of 4 rainfall\u2013runoff models using data from 240 catchments across southeast Australia. The first modeling experiment compares results from using a single lumped daily rainfall series for each catchment obtained from three methods: single rainfall station, Thiessen average, and average of interpolated rainfall surface. The results indicate considerable improvements in the modeled daily runoff and mean annual runoff in the model calibration and model simulation over an independent test period with better spatial representation of rainfall. The second experiment compares modeling using a single lumped daily rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15876682964925755413", "cites_id": ["15876682964925755413"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/12/5/2011jhm1340_1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FTDlzwlPVdwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
