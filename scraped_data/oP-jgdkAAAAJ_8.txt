SIMHYD has seven parameters and estimates stream flow from daily rainfall and areal potential evapotranspiration data. Model calibration and cross-validation studies were carried out to investigate whether SIMHYD can be calibrated successfully and whether the calibrated model can estimate stream flow for an independent test period. The results indicate that SIMHYD can estimate stream flow satisfactorily for practically all the catchments. The simulations were always good in wet and temperate catchments with poor simulations sometimes observed only in the dry or ephemeral catchments. The study also indicates that there is a high statistical significance between some of the model parameters and the catchment physical and climatic characteristics. However, the correlations observed in the simple investigation here are probably not high enough to develop meaningful relationships between model parameters and catchment characteristics for use in ungauged catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 375, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6156982223695268002", "cites_id": ["6156982223695268002"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033121352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:okjAG7b-cVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 8, "2004": 1, "2005": 15, "2006": 14, "2007": 5, "2008": 17, "2009": 24, "2010": 13, "2011": 23, "2012": 27, "2013": 28, "2014": 30, "2015": 24, "2016": 16, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 22, "2020": 11, "2021": 16, "2022": 29, "2023": 12}}
