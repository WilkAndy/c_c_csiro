For the last few decades, the rainfall\u2013runoff (RR) modelling approach has been the method of choice. There have been very few studies reported in literature which attempt to use flow duration curve (FDC) to predict daily runoff time series. This study comprehensively compares the two approaches using an extensive dataset (228 catchments) for a large region of south-eastern Australia and provides guidelines for choosing the suitable method. For each approach we used the nearest neighbour method and two weightings \u2013 a 5-donor simple mathematical average (SA) and a 5-donor inverse-distance weighting (5-IDW) \u2013 to predict daily runoff time series. The results show that 5-IDW was noticeably better than a single donor to predict daily runoff time series, especially for the FDC approach. The RR modelling approach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14268859264741592799", "cites_id": ["14268859264741592799"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415002140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:38720OYrBcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 16, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
