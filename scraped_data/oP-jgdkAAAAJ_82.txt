This paper concentrates on annual rainfall, whereas the second paper is devoted to streamflow. The first part describes the LEB's climate (arid to semi-arid), which is dominated by a subtropical high pressure ridge stretching latitudinally across central Australia. Then follow major analyses that include the characteristics of rainfall, wet and dry spell lengths and cumulative surpluses and deficiencies, rainfall trends and intra- and inter-decadal fluctuations, and the relationship between rainfall and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The paper concludes with six conclusions, the key ones being: the variability of the annual rainfall (based on the coefficient of variation) in the LEB is approximately 60 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3767627781324142023", "cites_id": ["3767627781324142023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019630800150X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x_W3X4FNSTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
