It predicts daily runoff, and daily loads of total suspended sediment, total nitrogen and total phosphorous from 175 different sub-catchments within the 22,670 km2 region. The model predictions are sensitive to changes in climate, storage operations, land use and land management practices, including point-and diffuse-source loadings and treatments. The EMSS is deployed in a GIS-like environment on a PC and has been designed for use by a range of stakeholders with varying levels of computer and technical proficiency. Three separate component models underpin the EMSS, including (i) a lumped-conceptual rainfall-runoff and pollutant export model,(ii) a flow and pollutant routing model, and (iii) a model of reservoir storage dynamics. The EMSS structure allows for existing component models to be easily replaced, and for additional ones to be added with minimal effort."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17259054229964038995", "cites_id": ["17259054229964038995"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/33888796/VertessyEtal_3ASM2001.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U6M1OGF6hO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
