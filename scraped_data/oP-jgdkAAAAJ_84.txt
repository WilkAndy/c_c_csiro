The information reported here includes: two drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index, SPI, and the Standardised Soil Moisture Index, SSMI); four drought metrics (percent time spent in droughts, mean drought duration, mean drought frequency, and mean drought intensity); and two drought categories (drought and extreme drought). The projections are developed from CMIP5 global climate model simulations of rainfall and soil moisture for the historical (1900\u20132005) and future (2006\u20132100) climates.The multi-model results project significant increases in all the drought hazard metrics, except frequency, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1360487544777423885", "cites_id": ["1360487544777423885"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094720300645", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DTzNuzZs4RIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 17, "2022": 24, "2023": 9}}
