The common approach is to calibrate hydrological models against streamflow data from gauged catchments, and then regionalize or transfer parameter values from the gauged calibration to predict runoff in the ungauged catchments. This paper explores the potential for using parameter values from hydrological models calibrated solely against readily available remotely sensed evapotranspiration data to estimate runoff time series. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require observed streamflow data for model calibration and is therefore particularly useful for runoff prediction in poorly gauged or ungauged regions. The modeling experiments are carried out using data from 222 catchments across Australia. The results from the remotely sensed evapotranspiration runoff\u2010free calibration are encouraging, particularly in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12839653303904203648", "cites_id": ["12839653303904203648"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019wr026236", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gHNhCqecL7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 15, "2022": 23, "2023": 6}}
