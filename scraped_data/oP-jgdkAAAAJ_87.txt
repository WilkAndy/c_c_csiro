In contrast to more temperate settings where there is a plethora of rainfall\u2013runoff modelling studies, the world\u2019s tropical regions, including those of Australia, have received little attention and thus the predictive skill of various rainfall\u2013runoff models and methods in tropical basins is less known. Using data from 105 catchments in tropical Australia, five daily rainfall\u2013runoff models and three methods of regionalising model parameters were compared. When locally calibrated, the more complex rainfall\u2013runoff models performed best. However, when the models were used to predict streamflow in \u2018ungauged\u2019 catchments the differences in model performance was negligible.
