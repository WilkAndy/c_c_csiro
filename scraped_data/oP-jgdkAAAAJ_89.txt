It is based on the methodology developed by CSIRO to deliver on four large-scale water availability assessments conducted in the Murray-Darling Basin, Northern Australia, south-west Western Australia, and Tasmania. It will focus on the application of the technique and results from Tasmania, providing a representative example of the approach used. The genesis of this work was the explicit desire by Australian State and Commonwealth governments to use the outputs of these water availability assessments for assisting the formation of state and federal government water policy. For example, the results of the work have already been utilised as a key technical input to decision making on funding for proposed irrigation projects in Tasmania \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9159046407895065543", "cites_id": ["9159046407895065543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411001181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xyPnZy54G38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
