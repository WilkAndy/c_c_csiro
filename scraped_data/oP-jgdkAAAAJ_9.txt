Application of the proposed index to two basins indicates that the single parameter precipitation elasticity index may give a general relationship between precipitation and streamflow in some cases, but that it cannot reflect the complicated non\u2010linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. For example, for the Spokane River basin the climate elasticity of streamflow index varies from 2.4 to 0.2, for a precipitation increase of 20%, as temperature varies from 1\u00b0C lower to 1.8\u00b0C higher than the long term mean. Thus a 20% precipitation increase may result in a streamflow increase of 48% if the temperature is 1\u00b0C lower but only a 4% increase if the temperature is 1.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 371, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1340146627915304986", "cites_id": ["1340146627915304986"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007WR005890", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GlDU90EomRIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 10, "2010": 16, "2011": 12, "2012": 20, "2013": 20, "2014": 20, "2015": 32, "2016": 28, "2017": 33, "2018": 34, "2019": 28, "2020": 30, "2021": 42, "2022": 22, "2023": 16}}
