For such a conceptualization, at the cessation of a transient hydrological disturbance of any magnitude the model will return to the same stable state and thus show an infinite resilience. To highlight and falsify this assumption, a numerical distributed ecohydrological model (coupled hillslope Boussinesq\u2010vertically lumped vadose zone) is presented, in which qualitatively different steady state water table elevations exist for the same parameter set. The multiple steady states are shown to emerge from a positive feedback arising from a reduction in leaf area index (LAI) and thus transpiration, as a saline water table approaches the surface. Limit cycle continuation is also undertaken to quantify the state\u2010space location of the threshold (repellor) between the steady \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5129139290388755539", "cites_id": ["5129139290388755539"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008WR006886", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U_QeXwJdLkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
