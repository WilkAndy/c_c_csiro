The model has two components-a hydrologic model and a pollutant export load model. The input climate data into the model are daily rainfall and mean monthly areal potential evapotranspiration and the main model outputs are total daily runoff and total daily pollutant loads (total suspended solids, total phosphorus and total nitrogen). There are seven parameters in the hydrologic model and two parameters in the pollutant export load model.The report also describes the estimation of parameters for the hydrologic and pollutant load models using local data. The parameter values that are adopted in the EMSS are presented below.
