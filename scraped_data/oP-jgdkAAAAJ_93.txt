This drought was primarily a cool season (April to October) phenomenon. In contrast, the breaking of the drought was a warm season (November to March) phenomenon. This reduction in winter rainfall along with an absence of very wet months led to a greater reduction in streamflow across the region than would be anticipated based on the 12% reduction in mean annual rainfall alone. The results presented in this article have linked the extent, duration, and severity of this drought to the ongoing observed expansion of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell at a rate of 0.5\u00b0/decade. This expansion has intensified the subtropical ridge over southern Australia, pushing cool season midlatitude storm tracks further south, leading to a reduction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=206954126153663169", "cites_id": ["206954126153663169"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013EF000194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wcIwZq4_3wIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
