Here we propose the use of a framework for the systematic and objective exploration of climate risk assessments. The matrix facilitates a breakdown of information about aim and context, main results, methodological choices, stakeholder involvement, sources and characteristics of uncertainties and overall weaknesses. We then apply the matrix to three risk assessments in the water sector to explore some methodological strengths and weaknesses of approaches strongly linked to climate model outputs (top-down) versus those that originate from local knowledge of climate exposures (bottom-up), and demonstrate that closer integration with social and physical sciences is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1278852086944178786", "cites_id": ["1278852086944178786"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378012001343", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YiKTijJlvxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
