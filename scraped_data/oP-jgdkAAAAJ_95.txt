All the large\u2010scale climate impact studies use the future climate projections from global climate models (GCMs) to estimate the impact on future water availability. This paper presents results from a detailed assessment to investigate the capability of 15 GCMs to reproduce the observed historical annual and seasonal mean rainfalls, the observed annual rainfall series and the observed daily rainfall distribution across south\u2010east Australia. The assessment shows that the GCMs can generally reproduce the spatial patterns of mean seasonal and annual rainfalls. However, there can be considerable differences between the mean rainfalls simulated by the GCMs and the observed rainfall. The results clearly show that none of the GCMs can simulate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16465045969710356186", "cites_id": ["16465045969710356186"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.7916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2hYQ6xKYf-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
