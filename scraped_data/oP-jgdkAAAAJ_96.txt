In particular, the mean state and variability of the ridge's intensity and position is diagnosed and compared to observations for the 20th Century. The mean annual cycle of the STR intensity and position are found to be moderately well represented compared to two observational datasets. The models project that STR intensity will increase over the 21st Century whilst its mean position will be further south. Given the historical relationship between the STR and rainfall, this suggests that southeastern Australia will most likely be drier in the future. Most models fail to reproduce the spatial pattern of correlation between the STR intensity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7768598108801397092", "cites_id": ["7768598108801397092"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3406", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZPHg9dGaz2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
