The technique is an important component in studies investigating the impact of climate change on runoff. This study assesses a simple analogue downscaling method \u2013 the statistically based method of Timbal and McAvaney (2001) to provide daily rainfall series for modelling runoff across southeast Australia. Using 10 global climate models (GCMs), the historical and future rainfall and runoff generated by this method were compared with the results from an empirical scaling method. We find that the analogue method can be used with hydrological models to simulate long-term average runoff over large regions reasonably well provided a suitable \u2018inflation factor\u2019 is applied. Without the correction, biases are too large for direct input to hydrological models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "oP-jgdkAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16691239870867091388", "cites_id": ["16691239870867091388"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941200827X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vK_egzoyo-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
