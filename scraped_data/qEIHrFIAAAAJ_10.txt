Although the analytical method has resulted in accurate estimation of soil thermal properties, we suggest that parameter estimation using inverse modeling (IM) provides new and unique opportunities for soil thermal characterization. Moreover, we show that the IM approach provides accurate estimation of soil water flux density in both unsaturated and saturated soil conditions for a wider range of water velocities than originally thought possible. Specifically, we show that accurate soil water velocity is obtained, simultaneously with soil thermal properties, if heat dispersion is included in the heat transport equation. The requirement for including heat dispersivity depends on the value of the newly defined dimensionless Keith Jirka Jan (KJJ) number \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 231, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3881805418405935589", "cites_id": ["3881805418405935589"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000WR000071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5blFG3bx3jUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 8, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 13, "2013": 19, "2014": 18, "2015": 12, "2016": 16, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
