The interplay between the landscapes, rivers and strongly monsoonal weather patterns has resulted in unique and diverse ecological systems that will need special care to retain their integrity. At the same time, with some 60-70 per cent of Australia\u2019s fresh water discharging from tropical rivers, there are pressures from various quarters to extract some of the water, including for irrigated agriculture.There is a unique and historic opportunity to ensure that management of Australia\u2019s northern water resources takes place within a strategic, ecologically, culturally and economically sustainable framework.
