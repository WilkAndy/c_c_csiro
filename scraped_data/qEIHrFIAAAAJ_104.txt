This trend is partly fuelled by widespread perceptions of abundant water resources in northern Australia, perceptions of declining rainfall trends across most of Australia, and recognition that some water resources in the southern states are over allocated and over used. Recent statements like\u2019rivers in northern Australia\u201d contain\u201d 70% of Australia\u2019s water resources \u2018(Anon. 2004a; Gehrke et al. 2004; Anon 2005; Gehrke 2005) serve to re-enforce these perceptions without acknowledging the more seasonal nature of streamflow and large evaporation in northern Australia. Among the main proponents for developing the water resources of northern Australia are large and small irrigators. However, there is recognition that mistakes have been made in the past with respect to irrigation development and water allocation practices \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4046250574757609110", "cites_id": ["4046250574757609110"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cuan-Petheram/publication/264200448_Towards_an_understanding_of_the_hydrological_factors_constraints_and_opportunities_for_irrigation_in_northern_Australia_A_review/links/53d20ec00cf220632f3c5f0a/Towards-an-understanding-of-the-hydrological-factors-constraints-and-opportunities-for-irrigation-in-northern-Australia-A-review.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lr6ltHUrJzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
