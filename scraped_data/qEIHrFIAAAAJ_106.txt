Data at the end of the first year of the study show that measured application rates at the selected sites varied from 10-24 ML/ha and that 4-62% of this water plus rainfall drained beneath the crop rootzone. Water use efficiency varied from 3-14 t/ML and economic analysis of the production figures suggest that the current water pricing in the Burdekin delta profit is not a major driver for reducing water use.INTRODUCTION."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2004207095016227814", "cites_id": ["2004207095016227814"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Bristow/publication/237643912_HEALTHY_CROP_AND_HEALTHY_GROUNDWATER_-_SUGARCANE_IN_THE_BURDEKIN_DELTA/links/00b4952630f04c5486000000/HEALTHY-CROP-AND-HEALTHY-GROUNDWATER-SUGARCANE-IN-THE-BURDEKIN-DELTA.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5oPC8rtf0BsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
