Results indicate that neutralized acid mine drainage can be used successfully for irrigation of a large variety of crops. Gypsiferous waters do not seem to have any deleterious effects on the soil environment as gypsum precipitates in the soil and salt is removed from the water environment. Sodium rich mine waters are less suited to irrigation, as soil physical problems can arise that need to be managed, and there is limited opportunity for gypsum precipitation. Management of plant nutrition is important when irrigating with mine waters, and it is essential to take into account the ions that are being added with the water. Groundwater monitoring indicates that salt plumes below irrigated fields are probably attenuated by the vadoze zone, and also by rainfall recharge to the water table that dilutes salt concentrations still further. Interception of drainage from irrigation, however, is possible if sites are selected carefully. This is especially true when irrigating rehabilitated land overlying mine spoils, enabling the reuse and isolation of drainage waters. This study highlights that there are four considerations to managing irrigation with saline water, namely: the quality of the irrigation water; the hydrological setting of the irrigated area; the management of the leaching fraction, and the fate of the drainage water. When social aspects like job creation, especially after mine closure, are considered, we conclude that irrigation with certain mine waters, on carefully selected and managed sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4820115474785945775", "cites_id": ["4820115474785945775"], "pub_url": "http://www.mwen.info/docs/imwa_2009/IMWA2009_Annandale.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r8j6enx95EIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
