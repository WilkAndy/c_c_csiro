Measurements of temperature and water content in a soil column that was heated strongly at the surface showed a consistent pattern of warming and drying. In initially wet soil, temperature rose to around 95 [degrees] C and remained there until the water content of the soil at that depth dropped below about 0.02 m3 m3. When the soil was initially dry, the temperature increased more rapidly, but even the moisture present in air-dry soil was sufficient to slow the rate of temperature rise when temperatures reached 90 [degrees] C. A linked-transport model, which simultaneously computes changes in temperature and water content, simulated the main features of heat and water flow in a soil column heated to high temperature. There were no consistent deviations of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10419099342192410264", "cites_id": ["10419099342192410264"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/abstract/1995/06000/soil_temperature_and_water_content_beneath_a.1.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mH7iIqYTmJAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 11, "2010": 13, "2011": 8, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 8, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 18, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
