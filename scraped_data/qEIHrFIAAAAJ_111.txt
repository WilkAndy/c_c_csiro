The physical environment predisposes seedbeds to high soil strength and temperature. It is frequently difficult, however, to determine the relative contributions of these stresses to emergence failure. Our capacity to determine the effect of soil strength is limited by: (a) a limited understanding of the effect of soil strength on pre-emergent shoot growth, and whether there is an interaction with soil temperature and (b) difficulty in measuring the mechanical stresses experienced by the pre-emergent seedling in a way that is applicable to a wide range of soils. We used a uniaxial compression cell to quantify the rate of shoot growth of maize as a function of soil strength (0 to 956 kPa), and to assess if temperature affected this relationship. Soil strength was calculated as spherical cavity expansion pressure, with field estimates taken from blunt \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=501690788299518586", "cites_id": ["501690788299518586"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198796800031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:erKtJx1d9gYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
