To minimize wicking, we investigated four different viscosity modifiers (VMs); gelatine (GL), sodium alginate (ALG), xanthan gum (XAN) and polyacrylamide (PAM) in our waterborne polymer formulation (PF). The viscosity modifiers were assessed based on their water solubility, miscibility with the PF and their effect on sprayability.The PF without a viscosity modifier (VM) exhibited a very low viscosity, 7\u20138\u202fmPa.s, at ambient temperature. Addition of VMs in the range of 2\u20138\u202fwt% concentration in the PF significantly increased the viscosity. All viscosity modified PF showed varying degrees of a shear thinning characteristic. Viscosity modified PFs showed reduce soil wicking by between 10\u201390% and, in general, retained mechanical properties similar to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7552631478325116225", "cites_id": ["7552631478325116225"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377418316883", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QX0AYVBW0GgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
