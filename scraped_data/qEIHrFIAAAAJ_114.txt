In China, the largest user of plastic mulch films, more than 184\u00d7 105 ha of agricultural soil is covered annually with plastic films, amounting to a total mass of around 14.7\u00d7 105 t of plastic waste for disposal. 2 Remnants of plastic mulches also remain in soil, leading to plastic pollution of agricultural land and possibly entering the food chain or water systems. Recycling of used plastic mulch films is often hampered by soil particles adhering to the plastics. Greater public awareness of the extent of the global plastic pollution problem and its ecological and societal impacts is one of the main driving forces behind current policy changes related to plastics use.
