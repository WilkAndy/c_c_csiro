This paper extends our 2012 study, in which we considered only one irrigation cycle and ignored the effects of plants. As a result of considering only one irrigation cycle, a large amount of water was used to change the water storage in the transport domain and only limited deep drainage of water and leaching of fertilizer at the bottom of the domain occurred in most scenarios investigated. To obtain a more realistic and complete picture, we have in this study considered multiple irrigation cycles to reflect actual field practices better and accounted for root water and nitrogen uptake and plant transpiration. As in our previous study, soil surface treatments at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7622473251455325636", "cites_id": ["7622473251455325636"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377419320293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xFXpXgl3yGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
