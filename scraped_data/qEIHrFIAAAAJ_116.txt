In this paper we report on the properties of a novel water dispersible, sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane and results of preliminary pot and field trials using this membrane to minimise soil evaporation. The polymer emulsion contains 40 wt% solid content with particle sizes in the 100-500 micron range and its viscosity is 400\u00b170 mPa.s; it is stable at ambient temperature and can be sprayed using standard farm equipment. The small scale pot trial indicated a 10-50% reduction in soil evaporation across a number of different soils. The field trial, on a Hanwood loam soil showed that the polymer membrane treatment maintained approximately the same crop yield compared to the control, but used 28% less irrigation water. Water use productivity was 0.34 to 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3094800421946440373", "cites_id": ["3094800421946440373"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7095875/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tbrYOJbw8ioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
