The scarcity of water supplies coupled with the need for urban communities to dispose of large quantities of treated recycled water from sewage treatment plants has led to increasing interest from urban and rural communities in the reticulation of this water for irrigating adjacent crop-production areas. Proposals to use recycled water inevitably lead to a complex range of issues that need to be addressed, including:  costs and benefits of supplying an additional source of water to current or new cropping systems;  optimum irrigation design and management, particularly where there are multiple sources of irrigation water;  management of overflow from on-farm water storages; and  environmental implications with regard to salinity, runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10245904200069989403", "cites_id": ["10245904200069989403"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar06316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G8Tat5XDMI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
