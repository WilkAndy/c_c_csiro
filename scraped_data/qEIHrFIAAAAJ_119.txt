These plots are commonly used in hydrochemistry and other branches of geochemistry with no discussion of the potential influence of the common variables on the observed trends. Some examples from the literature include: (1) Comparison of a sum to a component of the sum. (2) Comparison of a ratio to its own numerator or denominator. (3) Comparison of two ratios with the same numerator or denominator. These types of common variable plots may increase or decrease the correlation that exists between two independent variables. This paper presents a randomisation method for distinguishing between the \u201creal\u201d and induced relationships that can occur in plots of type 1, 2 or 3 above, thereby enabling a distinction between hydrochemical processes and induced correlation(s).
