Using the Campbell equation \u03b8 = a \u03c8\u2010c = \u03b8s (\u03c8\u2010c \u2212 \u03c8\u2010c0) relating volumetric water content, \u03b8, to matric suction, \u03c8, as an example, we examined a modification to ensure that the curve terminates in a suction \u03c80 = 1000 MPa, approximating oven dryness. The new equation is \u03b8 = a(\u03c8\u2010c \u2212 \u03c8\u2010c0) = \u03b8s (\u03c8\u2010c \u2212 \u03c8\u2010c0)/(\u03c8\u2010cc \u2212 \u03c8\u2010c0. It was compared with the unmodified equation by fitting to water\u2010retention data from Australia, the UK, and the USA. Results showed not only that the new equation fit the data slightly better than the original equation, with a mean standard deviation of 0.014 m3 m\u22123 about the regression, but also that its parameters could be calculated from those of the unmodified equation if original water\u2010content data were unavailable for fitting.
