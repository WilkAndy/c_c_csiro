In this paper we examine the use of daily minimum temperature as a predictor of daily mean vapor density. The prediction is based on the assumptions that the daily minimum temperature approaches dew point temperature, and that the diurnal variation in vapor density is small. Analysis of data from three north Australian agrometeorological stations showed that vapor densities could vary significantly during the course of a day, sometimes exceeding 10 g m\u22123 at the arid inland site during the summer months. Minimum air temperatures at the arid site also failed to reach dew point on most occasions, the exceptions in the summer months usually being associated with rain periods. This was not the case at the humid coastal sites, where there was no systematic departure of minimum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16298281826874760183", "cites_id": ["16298281826874760183"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016819239290099P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9xsTNPggL-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
