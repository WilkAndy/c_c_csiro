Efficient use of water and other agricultural inputs such as nutrients and pesticides must underpin agronomic practices to improve crop establishment and increase crop yields. A glasshouse study was conducted to explore the potential of a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane (SBPM) applied in bands to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature, thus improving germination, emergence and crop establishment. The aims were two-fold: (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of the SBPM in reducing seedbed water loss and its effect on seedling emergence; and (ii) to determine an effective band width (100 vs 150\u202fmm) and application rate of SBPM to conserve seedbed water. Our study demonstrated that a high application rate (1\u202fkg m-2) is effective at reducing soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17315593916610683801", "cites_id": ["17315593916610683801"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377419314763", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:maN-2uxYTfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
