We estimate the net profitability of these systems on a multi-period investment basis, and provide a ranking of the current and alternative systems according to economic criterion of net present value (NPV). Furrow A has the highest NPV followed by the Centre Pivot, then Furrow B and the Trickle irrigation system. When the volumetric water charges are used instead of area-based groundwater and differential surface water charges, the ranking of the irrigation systems changes and the Centre Pivot has the highest NPV followed by Furrow A, Furrow B, and Trickle. Under the volumetric water charging option, the overall NPVs for each irrigation system are lower than the NPVs for area-based water charges."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6447059651444749725", "cites_id": ["6447059651444749725"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023087293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nTUeUpiOeFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
