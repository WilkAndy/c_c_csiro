Different water footprint (WF) methodologies were investigated for their ability to improve water management at various scales. Methodologies according to the Water Footprint Network (WFN), life cycle assessment (LCA) and hydrological\u2010based approaches were assessed, and a working example is given for apples produced in South Africa. A fundamental viewpoint was defined and the knowledge hierarchy applied to investigate the approaches and information generated. WFs reported simply as a volume of water used per mass of crop produced cannot indicate the sustainability of the water use unless interpreted within the local hydrological and environmental context. The WFN methodology appears most useful to resource managers due to its quantitative nature and ability to compare blue and green water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17349994327397713024", "cites_id": ["17349994327397713024"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ird.2285", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gESVo-qPx_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
