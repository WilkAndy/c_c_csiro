The boundaries of peri-urban areas are not static. They are porous and in transition as new suburbs are developed outwards from towns and cities into rural lands. Regardless of how urbanisation occurs the boundaries between urban and peri-urban areas change. There will always be peri-urban zones. The global area of urban irrigated agriculture is estimated at about 24 Mha, about 11% of the total area under irrigated agriculture in the world (Thebo et al., 2014).
