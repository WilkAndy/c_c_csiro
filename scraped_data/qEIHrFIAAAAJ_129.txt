Making informed decisions about the future of irrigation in the north will require greater understanding of tropical systems and whether irrigation can be designed and managed in a way that is more in harmony with the natural ecosystems.Irrigation mosaics, involving smaller discrete patches of irrigated land dispersed across the landscape, may offer an alternative to traditional large-scale contiguous irrigation systems. This might be particularly attractive (at least at first glance) as a means of delivering improved social and economic opportunities for rural and remote (commonly indigenous) communities in northern tropical Australia. However, the longer-term environmental impacts of irrigation mosaics, and especially in tropical environments, in space and time, are still largely unknown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11651637723389566336", "cites_id": ["11651637723389566336"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42328347/Review_of_the_current_understanding_of_i20160207-27897-1lctmyf.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gB0twsbusqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
