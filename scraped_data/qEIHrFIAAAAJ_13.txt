In this paper we discuss solutions of the heat flow equation applicable to single and dual probe transient heating methods, and describe measurements made on air-dry sand to show how these methods can be used to obtain soil thermal properties. Measurements show that the two methods yield similar values of thermal conductivity. When determining thermal conductivity from the single probe data, it is best to use nonlinear curve fitting and to include a correction term in the model to account for the presence of the probe. Measurements of volumetric heat capacity made by using the dual probe heat-pulse method agreed well with independent estimates obtained using the de Vries method of summing the heat capacities of the soil constituents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 216, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14796846812589945227", "cites_id": ["14796846812589945227"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9940447", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i3FLbMf1WM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 12, "2011": 13, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 20, "2018": 8, "2019": 18, "2020": 10, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
