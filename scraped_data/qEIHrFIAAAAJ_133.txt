Simple and measurable climatic and landscape pattern attributes were analysed using change detection, trend analysis and backward variable elimination with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to identify controls on seasonal river flows and how landscape components could be enhanced to augment natural river flows.Landscape pattern showed increasing fragmentation, expansion of irrigated cropland and reservoirs and loss of forestland. Significant increasing trends (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were observed for reference evapotranspiration (ETo), one-day maximum rainfall, coefficient of variation (CV) of rainfall, maximum dry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=711095733940479570", "cites_id": ["711095733940479570"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581820302366", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UmbRbs1R3gkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
