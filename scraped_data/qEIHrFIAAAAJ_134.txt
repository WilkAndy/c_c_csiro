In this preliminary field study on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), a novel SBPM technology was compared to preformed slotted oxo-degradable plastic (ODP) mulch film and no mulch control (CON) in terms of yield, crop water productivity (CWP), and soil temperature. The first results showed higher CWP and crop yield, and increased soil water content under the SBPM cover. This study indicates that SBPM technology could perform at similar level as ODP or comparable films under field conditions and, at the same time, provide environmentally sustainable agricultural cropping practices. Additionally, the fully treated, non-replicated SBPM plot had a wetter soil profile throughout the entire crop season. This innovative technology has shown a high potential even at this early stage of development, indicating that advances in formulation and further testing can lead to significant improvements and thus increased use in crop production systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2734444933561709665", "cites_id": ["2734444933561709665"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/695140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YfTP6i2z8iUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
