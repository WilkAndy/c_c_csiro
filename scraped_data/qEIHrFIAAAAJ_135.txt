This report investigates methods for analysing irrigation mosaics in terms of their biophysical effects and impacts compared with a large contiguous area of irrigation. To estimate the effect of irrigation size and impact a scaling method was developed which calculates the marginal impact of having mosaics compared to one large contiguous area. We are able to show that by using a power function for the scaling that only one parameter is required to determine whether irrigation mosaics will result in positive, neutral or negative effects on the environment for a particular property of the irrigation system, compared with one big contiguous patch of irrigation of equal area. The various properties examined in this report are compiled into a summary table (Table 3).
