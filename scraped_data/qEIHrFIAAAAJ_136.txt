The workshop was held to progress development of the Sustainability Framework for the Northern Australia Irrigation Futures Project and to scope the potential for using the Ecological Risk Management Framework recently developed by Hart et al.(2005).We sought to use Ecological Risk Assessment to test the following:(i) stakeholders perspectives on the degree to which the wetlands of the Lower Burdekin protect the Great Barrier Reef (GBR); and (ii) the compatibility of two wetland values: habitat for plants and animals, and a buffer to protect the reef.
