We describe a simple heat\u2010pulse device for determining the volumetric heat capacity and hence water content of porous media. The device consists of three needle probes (0.813\u2010mm diam., 28 mm long) mounted in parallel. The heater probe contains a heating element while the sensor (mounted 6 mm from the heater) and reference probe (mounted 20 mm from the heater) contain thermocouples. The reference probe can be used to automatically correct for changes in background temperature. Measurements made at three depths during drying of a laboratory soil column yielded accurate changes in soil water content provided actual heater\u2010to\u2010sensor probe spacings were used in the calculations.
