Plastic mulch films (PMFs) are very efficient in conserving soil water conservation; however, plastic pollution is raising environmental and human health concerns. Therefore, a newly developed Sprayable Biodegradable Polymer Membrane (SBPM) Technology was tested for its ability to conserve soil water, suppress weeds, modify soil temperature, and improve crop yields. Two-year field experiments were performed in tomato and watermelon cropping systems, where SBPM was compared to no mulch and PMF controls. SBPM loadings were 3.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25\u2009kg m\u22122, with fumigation (F) and without fumigation (NF) in tomato, and 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25\u2009kg m\u22122 in watermelon. In tomato, the soil volumetric water content (VWC) in the topsoil was significantly higher for all treatments compared to the control, in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15385868308738834566", "cites_id": ["15385868308738834566"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837742030617X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hoBRf7WVhdUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
