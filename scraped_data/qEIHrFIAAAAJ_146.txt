Measured and simulated values were subjected to statistical analyses in order to assess model performance in all cases except for soil inorganic N. The model was observed to simulate the various variables tested with a range of accuracy, and in almost all cases, the model simulated the effect of nutrient stress on crop growth well. Although the new model was judged to be robust, continued testing of the various processes and refinement of approaches and algorithms is recommended to improve the model further."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9860826125726556966", "cites_id": ["9860826125726556966"], "pub_url": "https://www.wrc.org.za/wp-content/uploads/mdocs/1516-1-121.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JqPSzx2x2IgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
