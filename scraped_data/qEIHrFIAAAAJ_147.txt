This might be particularly attractive as a means of delivering improved social and economic opportunities for some rural and remote communities as well as better matching land use opportunities with landscape properties. The longer\u2010term environmental impacts of irrigation mosaics that may impair the sustainability of an irrigation project and the surrounding area are still largely unknown. However, there are findings from ecological and hydrological studies of other mosaics that can help with analysis of irrigation mosaics. This paper provides an overview of some biophysical aspects of irrigation mosaics, lessons learnt from other mosaics (e.g. landscape and farming system mosaics) and the potential environmental impacts of irrigation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8108467215705524328", "cites_id": ["8108467215705524328"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ird.600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aEgH4fgPh3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
