There is also an opportunity to decide whether to expand irrigation in northern Australia, and if so what irrigation should look like, where it should be located, and how it should be managed. Such decisions require improved understanding of northern river and catchment attributes and of the risks and benefits associated with irrigation in northern Australia.The Northern Australia Irrigation Futures (NAIF) project is a collaboration of the Australian, QLD, NT and WA governments, the Cooperative Research Centre for Irrigation Futures, Land and Water Australia\u2019s National Program for Sustainable Irrigation and CSIRO. Delivered through CSIRO, NAIF aims to develop new knowledge, tools and processes, including sustainability frameworks, to support debate and decision making regarding irrigation in northern Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14364310271692222124", "cites_id": ["14364310271692222124"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff-Camkin/publication/268050264_An_Ecologically_Sustainable_Development_Component_System_to_Support_Irrigation_Decision-Making_in_Northern_Australia/links/54b7aa9d0cf24eb34f6eca28/An-Ecologically-Sustainable-Development-Component-System-to-Support-Irrigation-Decision-Making-in-Northern-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rK61MxZIWMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
