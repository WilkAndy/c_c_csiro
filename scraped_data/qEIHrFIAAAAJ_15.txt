To determine accurately soil surface heat flux from measurements of heat flux at some depth below the surface, both heat storage above the plate and latent heat loss from below the plate must be taken into account. Large errors can be introduced if heat storage is neglected, and even larger errors can be found if latent heat processes are ignored. In this paper we describe a general framework for the correct interpretation of field measurements of soil heat flux."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 184, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17803657077022310930", "cites_id": ["17803657077022310930"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016819239402198S", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EsLIoshLE_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 11, "2006": 7, "2007": 14, "2008": 10, "2009": 11, "2010": 11, "2011": 12, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 3, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
