We highlight in particular the use of extended leaching periods to determine whether the duration of leaching affects the results.In the experiments, mixed cation solutions of two different salinity levels, 50 meq/L and 100 meq/L, were applied under constant head to columns of a repacked sodic clay soil using three replicates for each treatment. The maximum Ksat measured during leaching with the 100 meq/L solution was approximately double the maximum Ksat measured during leaching with the 50 meq/L solution. Measured flow rates were found to increase rapidly after flow commenced then decrease gradually until flow rates became stable. The final, stable flow rate was roughly 80 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10306845810707093741", "cites_id": ["10306845810707093741"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377415001407", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7VjrJahFCY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
