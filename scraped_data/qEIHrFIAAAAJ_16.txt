Both shortwave albedo and longwave emissivity are affected. These are linked to an effect of residue on surface evaporation and water content. Water content influences soil physical properties and surface energy partitioning. In summary, crop residue acts to soil as clothing acts to skin. Compared to bare soil, crop residues can reduce extremes of heat and mass fluxes at the soil surface. Managing crop residues can result in more favorable agronomic soil conditions. This paper reviews research results of the quantity, quality, architecture, and surface distribution of crop residues on soil surface radiation and energy balances, soil water content, and soil temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7847349818483654879", "cites_id": ["7847349818483654879"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00863556", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:38DxNhVj52wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 16, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 14, "2022": 21, "2023": 7}}
