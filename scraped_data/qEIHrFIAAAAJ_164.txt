Whereas N release from CRFs can be impacted by several factors, there has been a widely held view that soil water has little effect on N release from polymer\u2010coated CRFs. Past research has often studied the soil water effect as a function of soil water content. This limits the transferability of results. In this study we measured N release from a polymer\u2010coated urea (PCU) and a polymer\u2010sulfur\u2013coated urea (PSCU) using undisturbed soil cores at set matric potentials. Soil matric potential had a significant effect on N release from PCU. Release at \u22121,000 kPa was delayed by up to 30 d compared with \u221210 kPa. Optical stereo microscopy clarified that this was linked to differences in the rate of water absorption.
