In this study, measurements of soil solution EC (EC-sol)       collected in ceramic suction cups (SCs), wetting front EC (EC-wf) collected in Fullstop wetting front detectors (WFDs) and soil bulk EC (EC-bulk) measurements made using ECH2O-TE sensors and       converted to EC-sol, were compared. As a result of different methods of measurement and different components of soil waterflow being sampled, variations in EC measurement between SCs and WFDs       were observed. EC-sol was usually higher than EC-wf, as expected for this system, due to incomplete mixing between the draining and resident soil water during infiltration. For periods of high       solute leaching, however, the opposite can occur, indicating that WFDs are sampling when solutes are first mobilised at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16412123004486852225", "cites_id": ["16412123004486852225"], "pub_url": "https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/EJC119557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gZ503OqSw-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
