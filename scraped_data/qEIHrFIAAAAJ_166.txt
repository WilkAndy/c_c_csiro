Irrigation in the region relies heavily on underlying shallow major groundwater supplies.The Delta Water Boards have a charter that requires that they manage replenishment of the groundwaters. At a scheme scale several techniques are used to artificially recharge the aquifer. At farm-scale, water practices such as \u2018recycling\u2019and \u2018water spreading\u2019, and more recently direct pumping from recharge channels to farms in some distal aquifer zones have evolved to play an integral role in the management of the groundwater systems.\u2018Recycling\u2019refers to the practice where irrigation water that is not used by the plants (excess irrigation) cycles through the soil back to the groundwater. This seems at odds with current practice and expectations in other irrigation areas and especially with the current drive for improved \u2018water use efficiency\u2019.\u2018Water spreading\u2019refers to the practice where water that is too turbid to be used for recharge via recharge pits is made available across the scheme as surface water for irrigation.
