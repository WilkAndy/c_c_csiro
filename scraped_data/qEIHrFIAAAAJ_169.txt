One such aquifer is the Steenkoppies Aquifer, situated west of Tarlton (26\u00b002\u2032\u201326\u00b013\u2032 S, 27\u00b029\u2032\u201327\u00b039\u2032 E), which covers an area of 213 km2 with a catchment area of 311 km2. A perennial spring, Maloney\u2019s Eye that discharges into the Magalies River, serves as the only natural outlet for the groundwater stored in the aquifer. Discharge from this spring, for the last 100 years, varied between 0.05 and 1.035 m3 s\u22121 with an average of 0.455 m3 s\u22121. The standardised precipitation index (SPI) was used to evaluate the potential affect of meteorological and hydrological drought on this aquifer. The region has experienced two distinct periods of severe and extreme meteorological drought during the last 27 years (1990\u20131992 and 2002\u20132005). The cumulative rainfall departure (CRD) method was used to evaluate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17402375294678435246", "cites_id": ["17402375294678435246"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-6636-5_14", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:roVX9yCogfEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
