In this paper, temperature under two simple mulch architectures is compared and contrasted with that of bare soil in a tropical environment. In mulch treatments the quantities of mulch per unit area were similar, but elements in one treatment were horizontal (forming a 5 cm layer) while in the other they were vertical (forming a 22 cm layer). Temperatures were recorded for several days as the soil dried following a storm which saturated the mulch and surface soil. The bare soil dried more rapidly than that with mulch, so that by the fourth day its hourly maximum surface temperature was 8\u00b0C higher, and that at 2 5 cm depth was 3\u00b0C higher, than soil temperatures under the mulch. Significant differences in soil temperatures under the two mulch treatments only appeared several days later, as subtle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12281337407656530460", "cites_id": ["12281337407656530460"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9880269", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HJIVjk0TcKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 11, "1997": 3, "1998": 7, "1999": 7, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
