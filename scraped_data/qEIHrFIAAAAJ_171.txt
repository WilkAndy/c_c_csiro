This is being addressed through implementation of an ambitious water reform agenda, requiring Governments and communities to rethink how water is valued, allocated and managed. The aim is to deliver improved social, economic and environmental outcomes while at the same time returning all currently over allocated water systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction. Irrigation, as the single biggest user of water, will remain under scrutiny as it searches for new ways of improving water use efficiency while minimising unwanted environmental impacts. It is essential that Australia has well managed water systems that support productive and profitable irrigation within a catchment context. This paper provides a brief overview of key issues facing water and irrigation in Australia. It highlights in particular challenges facing irrigation and water management in the lower Burdekin, one of Australia\u2019s premier irrigation districts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11366967678440806527", "cites_id": ["11366967678440806527"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Heye-Bogena/publication/30046511_Water_and_Sustainable_Development/links/0deec51ac39f293d14000000/Water-and-Sustainable-Development.pdf#page=140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f5jP9uCUv50J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
