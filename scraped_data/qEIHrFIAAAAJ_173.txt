It is situated 90 kilometres southeast of Townsville (Figure 1) with some 80,000 ha of irrigated sugarcane and smaller areas of horticultural crops. While large parts of the lower Burdekin are underlain by extensive groundwater systems, security of surface water supplies was increased dramatically in 1987 on completion of the Burdekin Falls dam, which, with a capacity of 1,860,000 ML, is the largest water storage in Queensland. This water is used to supply surface irrigation water particularly to the Burdekin-Haughton Water Supply Scheme, and to recharge aquifers in the Burdekin delta, where groundwater is the main source of irrigation water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9658574528635816936", "cites_id": ["9658574528635816936"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Bristow/publication/267238208_EFFECTIVE_WATER_MANAGEMENT_VITAL_TO_THE_LONG-TERM_ECONOMIC_VIABILITY_OF_THE_LOWER_BURDEKIN/links/54d9e7d20cf2970e4e7d1398/EFFECTIVE-WATER-MANAGEMENT-VITAL-TO-THE-LONG-TERM-ECONOMIC-VIABILITY-OF-THE-LOWER-BURDEKIN.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Ev5R1wmCoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
