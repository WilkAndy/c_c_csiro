Controlled environment studies frequently fail to adequately simulate field conditions and seldom permit investigation of interactive physical conditions. In this paper, we describe a compression\u2010suction\u2010temperature (CST) cell designed to enable investigation of the response of preemergent seedlings to various strength and temperature regimes under unsaturated conditions. The cells allow independent control of soil strength, temperature, and matric potential. Suction within the CST cells is controlled by a hanging water column, soil strength by application of a uniaxial load, and soil temperature by a combination of heating and cooling of the upper and lower cell boundaries. Shoot growth in six cells was uniform, reflecting the minimal temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2876511806028982875", "cites_id": ["2876511806028982875"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronj1994.00021962008600010038x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WyqTRj9s6ycJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
