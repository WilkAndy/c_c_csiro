We will illustrate some of these points with examples.Density and Thermal Resistivity Figure 1 shows how important compaction is for achieving acceptably low thermal resistivity in backfill materials. A value often assumed for thermal resistivity of soil in buried cable calculations is 0.9 m C/W. None of the curves in Fig. 1 ever get that low, even at very high density. Typical density for a field soil that can sustain plant growth is around 1.5 Mg/m3. At this density, even the quartz soil has a resistivity more than 4 times the assumed value. Three important observations can be made from Fig. 1. First, organic material is never suitable for dissipating heat from buried cable, no matter how dense. Second, thermal resistivity of dry, granular materials, even when they are compacted to extreme density, is not ideal for cable backfill. Third, the air spaces control the flow of heat, so, even though quartz minerals have 4 times lower resistivity than the loam minerals, the overall resistivity of the two are similar at similar density. It is worth mentioning that arbitrarily high densities are not attainable just by compaction. Uniform sized particles pack to a given maximum density. To attain densities beyond that, without crushing particles, smaller particles are added to the voids between the larger particles. Highest densities are therefore attained by using well-graded materials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15203990084183481703", "cites_id": ["15203990084183481703"], "pub_url": "http://publications.aqualab.com/Application%20Notes/13943_Effect%20of%20Soil%20Thermal%20Resistivity%20on%20Underground%20Cable%20Installation_Print.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z11RaG1s_9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
