Groundwater modelling studies suggest no recovery of aquifer levels in the alluvial aquifers if the present trend of pumping continues. However, the pressure on water resources continues as farm businesses strive for economic viability amidst increasing environmental concerns for local and downstream catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6988587918460200711", "cites_id": ["6988587918460200711"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/67267826/An_economic_and_environmental_evaluation20210509-12828-bseqa.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BydoSa9z_GAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
