Estimation of thermal properties is based on theory for the conduction of heat away from an infinite line source (ILS) that is heated for a short period of time. In this study, we examined possible sources of error in the use of the ILS theory by comparing it with other models that explicitly account for finite length and cylindrical shape of the actual heater. For probe geometry and heating times typical of our experimental work, the analysis of model error showed that assuming an infinite length for a heat source of finite length caused errors <2% in the estimated thermal properties. Assuming the cylindrically shaped heater to be a line heat source caused errors of <0.6% in the estimated thermal properties.
