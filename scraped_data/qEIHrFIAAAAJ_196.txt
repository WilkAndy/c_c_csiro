The polymer was tested on two contrasting soils (sandy loam and clay), representative of those used to grow cotton in Australia. Changes in soil water content in non-treated and polymer-treated pots were monitored over 80 days, after surface or subsurface watering. Plant biomass, soil water content and soil chemical properties were determined at harvest. The polymer reduced soil water evaporation by up to 35% in sandy loam and up to 20% in clay, did not compromise seedling emergence and improved plant growth per unit water applied by up to 26.2%. The polymer underwent extensive degradation after 80 days to produce low molecular-weight polymers or oligomers and water-extractable silicon species that may have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3910328802295679060", "cites_id": ["3910328802295679060"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR19306", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VAjQ71NHRDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
