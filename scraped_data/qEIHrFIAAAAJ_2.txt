The relationship is Tt = A[1\u2014exp(\u2014B\u0394Tc)] where Tt is the daily total atmospheric transmittance, \u0394T is the daily range of air temperature, and A, B, and C are empirical coefficients, determined for a particular location from measured solar radiation data. Tests on three data sets indicate that 70\u201390% of the variation in daily solar radiation can be accounted for by this simple model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1400, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4050163515761991083", "cites_id": ["4050163515761991083"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192384900170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q509R0ISNTgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 8, "1994": 13, "1995": 7, "1996": 15, "1997": 20, "1998": 18, "1999": 16, "2000": 21, "2001": 33, "2002": 24, "2003": 33, "2004": 34, "2005": 35, "2006": 28, "2007": 25, "2008": 41, "2009": 36, "2010": 40, "2011": 58, "2012": 67, "2013": 89, "2014": 70, "2015": 80, "2016": 89, "2017": 76, "2018": 99, "2019": 75, "2020": 75, "2021": 46, "2022": 54, "2023": 35}}
