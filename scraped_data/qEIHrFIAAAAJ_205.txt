The hydraulic conductivity of sodicsoils has been shown to be affected by properties of the applied solution including pH (Suarez et al.1984), sodicity and salt concentration (McNeal and Coleman 1966). The changes in soil hydraulicconductivity are the result of changes in the spacing between clay layers in response to changes in soilsolution chemistry. While the importance o f soil chemistry in controlling hydraulic conductivity isknown, the exact impacts of sodic soil amelioration on hydraulic conductivity and deep drainage at agiven location are difficult to predict. This is because the relationships between soil chemical factorsand hydraulic conductivity are soil specific and because local site specific factors also need to beconsidered to determine the actual impacts on deep drainage rates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8310302074697003634", "cites_id": ["8310302074697003634"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU2019900020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:crKBArUfVHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
