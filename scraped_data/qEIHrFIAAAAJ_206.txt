Dealing with complexity, uncertainty and risk emerges as a shared need and responsibility for government and communities, highlighting the importance of mutual learning and shared knowledge. Local knowledge and effective long-term policy-stakeholder-research partnerships can support social learning and a more adaptive and resilient approach to integrated river basin management (IRBM). Additionally, there is rapid growth in the development of on-line tools that support new approaches to learning and help build communities of practice in the resolution of such complex problems. The lower Burdekin catchment downstream of the Burdekin Falls Dam is the largest irrigation area in Australia\u2019s north with approximately 80 000 ha of land under irrigation, predominantly sugarcane. It involves a complex mix of surface and groundwater use, with many of the typical problems experienced in irrigation systems worldwide, including insufficient understanding of the interconnectedness of biophysical, social and economic factors. The inability of institutional frameworks to support a more integrated management approach is a common criticism from those within the catchment. Recognising these challenges, Lower Burdekin Water Futures, a group of local stakeholders, policy makers and Northern Australia Irrigation Futures researchers, has developed a collaborative platform, including an on-line \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4958756915938280631", "cites_id": ["4958756915938280631"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff-Camkin/publication/294645942_Integrated_River_Basin_Management_The_Role_of_Social_Learning_and_Community_Knowledge_in_Dealing_with_Complexity_and_Uncertainty/links/56c2c38f08ae2dc3eb884e74/Integrated-River-Basin-Management-The-Role-of-Social-Learning-and-Community-Knowledge-in-Dealing-with-Complexity-and-Uncertainty.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t0QDdiQL0UQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
