In this paper we provide an overview of the multi-needle heat-pulse probe which can now provide measurements of soil temperature, soil thermal diffusivity, volumetric heat capacity, thermal conductivity, volumetric water content, and bulk soil electrical conductivity, all at the same position and time. We show that the multi-needle probe can provide high quality measurements, in some cases as good as or better than those obtained using other current methodology. As an example, multi-needle probes have been shown to yield measurements of volumetric water content with a root mean square error of 0.01 m3 m\u22123. Because of its small size the multi-needle probe should prove particularly useful for measurements near the soil surface, near \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2462546179747215206", "cites_id": ["2462546179747215206"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169900001861", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZvfTDrS4LCIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 8, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 14, "2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 6}}
