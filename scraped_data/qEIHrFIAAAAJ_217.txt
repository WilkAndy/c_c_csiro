However, the use of plastic represents large environmental concern since the recovery of plastics from soils and its persistence in the environment is causing global problems. The EU in leading in policy with ban on single use plastics and it is a matter of time when conventional plastic mulch films will be banned as well. To solve the problem, researchers have turned their attention to biodegradable products while lately sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane (SBPM) technology was introduced. Here, we present first results of glasshouse study and in-field experiments with SBPM technology in Australia where with the use of subsurface drip irrigation we could improve water use efficiency of crops with reducing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..22.7268F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
