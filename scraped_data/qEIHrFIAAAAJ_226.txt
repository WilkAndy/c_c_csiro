However, only a few numerical models consider coupled water, vapor and energy transport in both the subsurface and at the soil-atmosphere interface. While hydrological and thermal processes in the subsurface are commonly implemented in existing models, which often consider both isothermally and thermally induced water and vapor flow, the interactions at the soil-atmosphere interface are often simplified, and the effects of slope inclination, slope azimuth, variable surface albedo and plant shading on incoming radiation and spatially variable surface mass and energy balance, and consequently on soil moisture and temperature distributions, are rarely considered. In this presentation we discuss these missing elements and our attempts to implement them into the HYDRUS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.5662S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
