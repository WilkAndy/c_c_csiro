However, only a few numerical models (if any) consider coupled water, vapor and energy transport in both the subsurface and at the soil-atmosphere interface. While the subsurface is commonly implemented in existing models, which often consider both isothermal and thermally induced water and vapor flow, the effects of slope inclination, slope azimuth, variable surface albedo and plant shading on incoming radiation and spatially variable surface mass and energy balance, and consequently soil moisture distribution, is rarely considered. In this presentation we discuss these missing elements and our attempts to implement them into the HYDRUS model. We demonstrate implications of some of their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.H54B..05S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
