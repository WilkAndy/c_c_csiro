Agriculture can impact water quality negatively, mainly through the export of salt, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the root zone to waterways. In this study, long-term chemical water quality data obtained from the South African Department of Water Affairs was used to assess the quality of river water in the Crocodile, Komati-Lomati and Pongola River Catchments and for the Mkuze and Umfolosi Rivers. Electrical conductivity (EC) data shows an increase in salt concentration as the rivers run their course as a result of various anthropogenic activities in the catchments. Irrigators located further downstream will therefore generally have to pay better attention to salinity management. A fair to marginal sodicity hazard is present for the Pongola River, and a more serious salinity and sodicity hazard is present for the Mkuze and Umfolosi Rivers. Irrigators in these regions are therefore encouraged to monitor water quality and adapt management practices accordingly. Nutrient enrichment was generally evident for all the rivers. More intensive monitoring, including organic forms of N and P, is recommended to improve our understanding of the contribution of different anthropogenic activities to river water pollutant loads."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113349200", "cites_per_year": {}}
