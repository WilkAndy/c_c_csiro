Dealing with complexity, uncertainty and risk emerges as a shared need and responsibility for government and communities, highlighting the importance of mutual learning, shared knowledge and systems thinking. Local knowledge and effective long-term policy-stakeholder-research partnerships can support social learning and a more adaptive and resilient approach to irrigation, water and catchment management. In this paper we discuss challenges and successes the Cooperative Research Centre for Irrigation Futures (CRC IF) System Harmonisation program experienced working with five irrigated regions across Australia. We also draw from these different regional experiences some common lessons for harmonising irrigation systems and confronting complex water challenges."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/the-role-of-engagement-collaboration-and-co-learning-in-deliverin", "cites_per_year": {}}
