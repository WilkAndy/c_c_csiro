The soils where this occurs are predominantly sodic clay soils with low hydraulic conductivities. Many of these soils have been treated by applying gypsum or by increasing the salinity of irrigation water by mixing saline groundwater with fresh river water. While the purpose of these treatments is to increase infiltration into the surface soils and improve productivity of the root zone, the treatments appear to have altered the soil hydraulic properties well below the root zone leading to increased groundwater recharge and rising water tables. In this paper we discuss application of the HYDRUS model with major ion reaction and transport and soil water chemistry-dependent hydraulic conductivity to assess the likely depth, magnitude and timing of the impacts of surface soil amelioration on soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFM.H31A0758R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
