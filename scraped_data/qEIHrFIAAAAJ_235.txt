In this paper we discuss progress in understanding the origin and fate of salts. We highlight in particular the subregional nature of the problem, the need to address water quantity and quality issues simultaneously, and the need for a whole of systems water and salt management plan. An emerging and disturbing question arsing from this work is if it is in fact possible to remove salts from this coastal floodplain system which is underlain by largely unconfined aquifers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7397708821508292086&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
