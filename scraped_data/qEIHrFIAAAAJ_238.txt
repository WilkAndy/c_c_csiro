In this paper we focus discussion on tropical groundwater systems and risks and uncertainties associated with irrigation. Attention is given to the fate of solutes in irrigated systems, particularly the idea of\" solute flushing\" from groundwater systems and the potential impacts on associated ecological systems. Experience is showing that understanding the hydrogeological setting and potential impacts of irrigation on the quality of groundwaters is critical for making decisions about where to locate and how to manage irrigated systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.H32B..07B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
