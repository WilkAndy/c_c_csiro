Longer term, steadily risiing groundwater salinity levels have been reported in bores in the Airdmillan Road area of the North Burdekin Water Board (NBWB). The Airdmillan Road area is close to the coast and the environment surrounding the area is a complex mix of hydrological features. Groundwater and surface water are used for irrigation of sugarcane. Lack of pumping volumes is a severe impediment to allow both whole-of-scheme and on-farm water management. The current level of available data on groundwater surface water pumping and crop water requirements is not sufficient to show how each of these factors contribute to the overall hydrology and salinity in the area. This report briefly describes the extent and cause of the problem to form a management plan for sustainable groundwater resources in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:ca387591-e098-495a-b6e9-204412a2c953", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MhFMPMDvPaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
