Therefore, any adverse impacts on the groundwater resource are undesirable.  Field studies were implemented to improve knowledge and understanding of impacts of current and modified irrigation management practices on crop water use, productivity and long-term sustainability of the Burdekin Delta groundwater system.  Field trials were established on six sites representing different soil types of the Delta comparing conventional (CONV) and best management practice (BMP) irrigation systems.  The BMP applied was site specific, and was determined by consultation with BSES extension officers and the individual grower.  Sites were instrumented to measure irrigation application, crop water use and the quality of water draining beneath sugarcane crops.By using BMP irrigation, a reduction in water application of 15 and 14% was achieved during the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 irrigation seasons, respectively.  This equated to an average saving of 6.4 and 2.9 ML/ha, respectively.  Crop production figures indicated an increase of 5% (7 t/ha) in 2001-2002 season and a decrease of 3% (4 t/ha) in 2002-2003.  The combination of reduced water and increased yield in the 2001-2002 season resulted in a 24% overall increase in productivity across farms.  The combination of reduced water and reduced yield in the 2002-2003 season resulted also in an increase in productivity of 11%.  This was in line with the Cane Productivity Initiative (CPI) where an increase in productivity of 20% is expected across the Burdekin district.Deep drainage was calculated from each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/1042", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:idLY1rvsVegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
