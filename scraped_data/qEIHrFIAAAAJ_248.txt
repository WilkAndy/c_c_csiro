Because it is located adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon, there is strong interest in understanding the fate of nitrogen applied as fertiliser. Natural denitrification is increasingly recognised for its ability to reduce nitrate concentrations in groundwater and we therefore analysed water samples for a range of constituents (nitrate, ferrous iron, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, pH) from 57 monitoring bores to investigate the denitrification potential of the lower Burdekin aquifers. Nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 14.4 mg/L N03-N (three times the ANZECC environmental standard of 5 mg/L). Ferrous concentration varied from 1 to 360 mg/L, dissolved oxygen was 2 mg/L, redox potential varied from-120 to+ 235 mV, and pH ranged from 5.9 to 7.6. Elevated nitrate levels were observed in 16 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:d6caea89-d31f-4d93-b529-00bc585b79ce", "cites_per_year": {}}
