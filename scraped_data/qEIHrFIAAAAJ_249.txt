In order to maintain regular water supply for irrigation, the Val-Bird Weir was built in 1983 on the Haughton River as part of the Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme (BHWSS). This has lead to a rise in water tables and potential threat of salinisation of surrounding lands in the region.In this study a groundwater model (using MODLOW) has been developed for the area. The model accounts for irrigation, recharge, crop water use, rainfall, constant head in the river, and hydrogeology of the aquifer system. Bore hydrographs for the area were analysed and the model was calibrated against observed data using the parameter optimisation package PEST. The calibrated model was then used to study the effects of lowering Val-Bird Weir height on surrounding water tables.
