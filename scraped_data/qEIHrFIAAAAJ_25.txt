Measurement techniques include steady\u2010state methods, and transient methods. Steady\u2010state heat flow methods require maintenance of a constant temperature gradient within the soil, and this can cause water to redistribute in response to the applied temperature gradient, thereby altering the thermal property one is attempting to measure. Transient methods are therefore usually preferred for determining soil thermal conductivity because the effects on soil water movement are far smaller for these methods than they are for steady\u2010state methods.
