Using available information and cumulative experience, the water managers have successfully dealt with major challenges in the past, including the risk of seawater intrusion into the fresh water aquifer system. A number of external pressures are now facing the lower Burdekin and many other similar sugar producing regions including the Council of Australian Governments Water Reform Policy, development and implementation of the Queensland Water Resource Plans, Great Barrier Reef water quality targets, increasing threats of salinity, and low world sugar prices. Response to these will affect how internal production/environmental/economic issues are addressed in the region.'Internal'pressures include groundwater quantity and quality, irrigated salinity, and continued threat of seawater intrusion, all with potential to affect sugarcane yields and loss of productive land. To help address these external and internal pressures and analyse the future consequences of current strategies a range of new tools are being sought through the Lower Burdekin Initiative. These endeavours include:(1) ground and surface water management options for sea water intrusion control;(2) fertilizer management to maintain aquifer quality;(3) analysis of socioeconomic impacts of water reform; and (4) development of user-friendly systems to help the local managers and community view the status of their environment and potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033076916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GBBS2hJfbGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
