Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf. cv. Splendour/MM.106 and Braeburn/M.9) was measured using the compensation heat-pulse method. Supporting measurements were made of the total photosynthetic photon flux (QP) and the total all-wave radiation (QN) absorbed by each tree. These data were used to test the output from a three-dimensional model of light interception that approximated the orchard as an array of nonoverlapping, truncated ellipsoids, with each tree having a uniform density of green leaves that were randomly distributed within the canopy volume. Experimental observations, together with model predictions, were used to demonstrate how transpiration responds to changes in the aerial environment. Model testing was rigorous in the sense that the model was compared against complete and independent data collected on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=718043580823509364&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
