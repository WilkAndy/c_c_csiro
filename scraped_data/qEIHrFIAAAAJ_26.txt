We show that this is possible using the Kirchhoff transform (K transform) when solving Richards' equation numerically, even though the K transform is not continuous across boundaries between layers with different hydraulic properties. The solution is achieved by dividing the soil into depth elements, using the K transform to compute flow within each element, and then using matric potential (which is continuous across boundaries) to couple the elements. Combination of the K transform with iterative, implicit, mass\u2010conserving methods of solving the flow equations results in efficient solutions that take no more than a few seconds on a personal computer to simulate infiltration. This is achieved with errors of only a few percent in the amount and distribution of soil water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11896187199486593067", "cites_id": ["11896187199486593067"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1990.03615995005400060002x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K4jyrjq_F6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 7, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
