Because of the inherent spatial soil heterogeneity, the outcome of a soil physical measurement is dependent on measurement volume. Usually, soil physical characterization requires more than a single soil measurement type. Consequently, the presence of soil heterogeneity mandates that these different measurements are taken at the same location, and that each measurement type integrates over approximately identical measurement volumes, thereby minimizing soil heterogeneity effects. In general, though, when more than a single soil variables or parameter is measured, multiple instruments are used, with their measured values pertaining to different soil locations and measurement volumes. In the following we will present various examples of multi-functional instruments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUFM.H22H..02H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
