It was established on a site with no previous history of sugarcane, the aim being to analyse changes in soil properties with time in an attempt to establish critical factors which lead to a break down in the soils productive capacity, as expressed by a decline in crop yield. The intent was to use the information coming from the Rundown experiment to develop more targeted research and/or management strategies to limit the negative impact of changes in soil biophysical properties on sugarcane yield. Most of the soil physical and water related work carried out at the Rundown site as part of the Sugar Yield Decline Joint Venture (SYDJV) was funded and reported through CLW004, whereas most of the soil chemical and biological work was resourced and reported through the SYDJV. This report, which includes detailed technical reports of the soil physical and water related work, provides a summary of project CLW004. Additional details of the soil chemical and biological work carried out at the Rundown site are dealt with largely through the SYDJV documentation.  The decision to close the Rundown experiment as part of SRDC, BSES and CSIRO Land and Water project restructuring to address the tightening financial conditions within the sugar industry was made in May 1999. All equipment was removed from the site, which was handed back to the owners in June 1999. The early closure of the Rundown site meant that the original objectives of the Rundown experiment were not realised. The main reason is that it was not possible to undertake the major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11049846357278896930&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IrNApLfwWJkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
