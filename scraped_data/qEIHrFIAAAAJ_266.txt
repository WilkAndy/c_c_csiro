The slope of the WRC, or pore-size distribution index, is well described by the model but the bubbling pressure, or inflection point is poorly described. Without a good estimation of the bubbling pressure it is not possible to scale the physico-empirical model to the WRC. To achieve the scaling, a single measured point on the WRC in the unsaturated range is required. The resulting estimated water contents may be satisfactory for application within broad-scale leaching risk models and for generalised extrapolation of results from detailed experimental sites but caution is still required for quantitative applications of nitrate leaching models at a particular site. It is concluded that soil surveys could \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18407738544290403541&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
