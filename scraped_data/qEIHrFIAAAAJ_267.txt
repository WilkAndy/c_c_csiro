It has been estimated to cost the sugar industry $200-$400 million per year, and has in the past been largely associated with soil microbiological factors (Magarey 1996). The loss in a soils productive capacity can be expressed schematically as in Fig. 1.1, which can serve as a framework for the research studies being carried out at the Rundown site near Tully in north Queensland. It has been established from previous work that fumigation results in an increased yield of up to 20%(Muchow et al 1994; Magarey and Croft 1995), and this increase in yield (shown as A in Fig. 1.1) can be attributed largely to soil biological (pathological) factors (and maybe some nutritional aspects as a result of the\u2019flush\u2019of nutrients that usually follows fumigation).
