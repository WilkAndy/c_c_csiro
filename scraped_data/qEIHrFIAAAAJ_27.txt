A mechanistic model simulating the decomposition of surface\u2010managed winter wheat residues was developed and model predictions were compared to results from field studies of decomposition rates. The model consists of two submodels. The first simulates decomposition of the various components of wheat residues (straw, leaves, and chaff) under constant conditions. This submodel requires input on the N content of the residue, and is based on results of laboratory experiments in which respiration was measured. The second submodel uses meteorological data to simulate environmental conditions in the residue layer. This information is combined with laboratory derived estimates of the effects of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17522300506959206091", "cites_id": ["17522300506959206091"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300010017x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y1bzVHm3K_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 5, "1994": 11, "1995": 3, "1996": 9, "1997": 4, "1998": 5, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
