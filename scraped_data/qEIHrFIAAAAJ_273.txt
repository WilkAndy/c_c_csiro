The characterization of these functions in terms of models which use two or three parameters has received much attention (Gardner et al, 1970; Campbell, 1974; van Genuchten, 1980). This is because these models can provide efficiency in the numerical methods used to solve the Richards flow equations (Campbell, 1985; Ross and Bristow, 1990). Current methods for determination of the water retention function, while well developed, are cumbersome and costly. In view of the large number of samples required to deal with the variability encountered in the field, considerable interest has developed in the estimation of water contents at specified water potentials from soil properties such as texture, structure, organic matter and clay mineralogy which are known to be empirically related to soil water retention (Clapp and Homberger, 1978; Gupta and Larson, 1979)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18430571886217404791&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dyFKLXuLxv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
