Application of the concepts is illustrated by analyses of high temperature stress in pre-emergent maize seedlings. The results show that the maximum temperature alone can account for more than 90 percent of the variation in the reduction of shoot length due to the occurrence of supra-optimal temperatures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9203070", "cites_per_year": {}}
