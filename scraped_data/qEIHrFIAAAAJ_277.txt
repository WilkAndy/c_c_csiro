Rates of drying of soils were directly related to bare-zone width; maximum temperature at 5 cm depth was greater in a loamy sand than in a clay loam, and also increased with bare-zone width. The benfits of maximising surface cover under these conditions are clearly demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9000353", "cites_per_year": {}}
