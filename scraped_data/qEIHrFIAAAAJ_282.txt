As such it is divided into eight main chapters on soil sampling and statistics, the solid, solution, and gas phases, soil heat, solute transport, multi-fluid flow, and erosion. More than 100 world experts contribute detailed sections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssabookser5.4", "cites_per_year": {}}
