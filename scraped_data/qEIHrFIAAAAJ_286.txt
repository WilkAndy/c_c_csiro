Consequently, many coastal regions experience extensive seawater intrusion in aquifers resulting in severe deterioration of groundwater quality. Artificial recharge can be used to maintain groundwater levels and subsequently control seawater intrusion. This technique, however, is often costly and ineffective in areas where excessive groundwater pumping occurs. In Australia, coastal Queensland is fortunate to have extensive groundwater resources. However, serious problems of saltwater intrusion exist in many coastal areas of Queensland (Hillier, 1993; Murphy and Sorensen, 2002). The first step in dealing with these problems is to evaluate the size and extent of the intrusion. In the Burdekin Delta of North Queensland for example saltwater intrusion has been of concern since early 1960\u2019s. The Delta is situated in the dry tropics of North Queensland and provides a major water resource for the irrigation of more than 40,000 ha of sugarcane. The cuspate delta overlies a shallow groundwater system, and its close proximity to the Great Barrier Reef makes it unique. More than 1800 groundwater pumps are currently being used for irrigation purposes, and excessive pumping has resulted in seawater intrusion near the coastline. Aquifer management practices include large recharge pits to assist with artificial replenishment of the aquifer system.In this paper we describe the use of a variable density flow and solute transport model, SUTRA (Voss, 1984), to define the current and potential extent of saltwater intrusion in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carsten-Schleeberger/publication/236341588_Simulation_of_Seawater_Intrusion_in_the_Lower_Burdekin_Delta_Aquifer_North_Queensland/links/0deec517be05a4287d000000/Simulation-of-Seawater-Intrusion-in-the-Lower-Burdekin-Delta-Aquifer-North-Queensland.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4JY6lmug6LEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
