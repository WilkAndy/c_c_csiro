It is a software package developed within the CSIRO Division of Soils for simulating infiltration, evapotranspiration, and redistribution. The first version (SWIMv1) was published in 1990 (Ross, 1990b). Version 2 of the model (identified as SWIMv2. 0), which combines water movement with transient solute transport and which accommodates a variety of soil property descriptions and more flexible boundary conditions, was completed in 1992. The latest version, SWIMv2. 1, is described in this manual.SWIMv2 is based on a numerical solution of the Richards\u2019 equation and the advection-dispersion equation. It can be used to simulate runoff, infiltration, redistribution, solute transport and redistribution of solutes, plant uptake and transpiration, soil evaporation, deep drainage and leaching. The physical system and the associated flows addressed by the model are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Soil water and solute transport properties, initial conditions, and time dependent boundary conditions (eg, precipitation, evaporative demand, solute input) need to be supplied by the user in order to run the model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=procite:9d3df761-b423-4ee4-87f5-46e8ecd71a58&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jeTkD2FvVVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
