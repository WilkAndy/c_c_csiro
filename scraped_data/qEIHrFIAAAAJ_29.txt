This version of the model has been designed specifically for use in farming systems simulation. Development within the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) framework enables SWIM3 to be combined with a wide range of soil and crop models to simulate a variety of agricultural systems. Other improvements in this release provide a new approach for specifying soil hydraulic properties from simple measures of soil water behavior. The simplicity of this new approach makes such a mechanistic numerical model more accessible to farming systems researchers. The effectiveness of this approach and the utility of SWIM3 for use in farming systems analysis is demonstrated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9478079122727937597", "cites_id": ["9478079122727937597"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=42243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PaY-v77miIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
