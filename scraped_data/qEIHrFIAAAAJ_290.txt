This paper discusses results of a simulation study that highlights opportunities to improve water and nutrient use efficiency and hence reduce deep drainage and nitrate leaching in furrow irrigated systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3932587734753893174&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NlsQgrVbkzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
