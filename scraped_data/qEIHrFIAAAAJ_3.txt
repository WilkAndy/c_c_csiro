The water-retention data sets contain 733 samples for prediction and 109 samples for validation. We present both parametric and point estimation PTFs using different approaches: multiple linear regression (MLR), extended nonlinear regression (ENR) and artificial neural network (ANN). ENR was found to be the most adequate for parametric PTFs. Multiple linear regression cannot be used to predict van Genuchten parameters as no linear relationship was found between soil properties and the curve shape parameters. Using the prediction set, ANN performance was similar to the ENR performance for the prediction dataset, but ENR performed better on the validation set. Since ANN is still considered as a black-box approach, the ENR approach which has a more physical basis is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 519, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5903661362112668379", "cites_id": ["5903661362112668379"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706199000610", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:26Ls2roE7lEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 16, "2003": 15, "2004": 24, "2005": 11, "2006": 24, "2007": 17, "2008": 26, "2009": 23, "2010": 30, "2011": 19, "2012": 27, "2013": 36, "2014": 38, "2015": 27, "2016": 27, "2017": 21, "2018": 24, "2019": 27, "2020": 22, "2021": 20, "2022": 28, "2023": 6}}
