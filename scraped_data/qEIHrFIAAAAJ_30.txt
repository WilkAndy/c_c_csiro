The majority of plastic mulch films are however not biodegradable and are typically removed after each growing season. Recovery of these plastics from the soil is difficult and can affect successive crop yields while causing substantive cost to the environment and farmers. Due to increasingly stringent regulations regarding use of non-degradable plastic in agriculture they are likely to be phased out in the near future. In the past 10 years several classes of \u2018biodegradable\u2019 materials have been studied but most of these films are reported to be relatively weak in mechanical properties, not efficiently degradable and cost prohibitive.More recently, researchers have turned their attention to sprayable biodegradable polymer coatings for use on soils due to their easy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8709215643409999351", "cites_id": ["8709215643409999351"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377416300439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:92W6-XtZ3XgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 17, "2020": 29, "2021": 24, "2022": 17, "2023": 9}}
