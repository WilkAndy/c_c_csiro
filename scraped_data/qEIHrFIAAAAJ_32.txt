The heat pulse (HP) method is a transient method for determination of soil thermal properties and a wide range of other physical properties in laboratory and field conditions. The HP method is based on the line\u2010heat source solution of the radial heat flow equation. This literature review begins with a discussion of the evolution of the HP method and related applications, followed by the principal theories, data interpretation methods, and their differences. Important factors for HP probe construction are presented. The properties determined in unfrozen and frozen soils are discussed, followed by a discussion of limitations and perspectives for the application of this method.
