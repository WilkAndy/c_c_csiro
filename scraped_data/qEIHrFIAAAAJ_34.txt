Such needs arise, for example, when field-scale behavior must be determined from soil hydraulic data collected from a limited number of in situ field measurements or analysis of small soil cores in the laboratory. The scaling problem cannot be solved by simple consideration of the differences in space or time scale, for several reasons. First, spatial and temporal variability in soil properties create uncertainties when changing between scales. Second, flow and transport processes in geophysics and vadose zone hydrology are highly nonlinear. We present a historical overview of the theory of scaling procedures, and demonstrate the application of various aggregation techniques, such as scaling and inverse modeling, to aggregate laboratory-scale soil hydraulic properties to larger scale effective soil hydraulic properties. Examples of application of these aggregation techniques from the pore scale to the watershed scale are demonstrated. We conclude that the development of new instrumentation to characterize soil properties and their variation across spatial scales is crucial. Moreover, the inherent complexity of flow in heterogeneous soils, or soil-like materials, and the need to integrate theory with experiment, requires innovative and multidisciplinary research efforts to overcome limitations imposed by current understanding of scale-dependent soil flow and transport processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10662672917551840341", "cites_id": ["10662672917551840341"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/d6366i6a2ffdfi75rdjq67cp5q/access/wayback/http://hopmans.lawr.ucdavis.edu/papers-ppt-zip/JRPhilip.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VfzadoZs-ZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 10, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
