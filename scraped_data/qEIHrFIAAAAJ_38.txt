Furrow irrigation is widely used around the world and is considered as a major source of nitrate leaching. Improved soil, water and fertilizer management practices are needed to improve the production and environmental performance of furrow irrigated agriculture. This paper describes results of a simulation study using HYDRUS-2D to assess opportunities to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce the risk of nitrate leaching from furrow irrigated systems. It focuses on the commonly used practice in Pakistan where irrigation water supply is turned off once the water level in the furrow has reached a pre-determined depth. The study involved analysing the impact of fertilizer placement on nitrate leaching from a loamy soil subjected to three different soil surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17007001453891667003", "cites_id": ["17007001453891667003"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377412002405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O8TDIbcBBewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 15, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
