High drying rates that are characteristic of these regions can result in the early onset of high soil strengths and high soil temperatures, which are detrimental to seedlings. In this study, we examined the response of preemergent shoot growth of maize (Zea mays L.) to differences in the drying rate of a hardsetting red\u2010brown earth (fine, mixed, thermic Typic Paleustalf or Calcic Luvisol). We examined the impact of high soil strength on the constituent shoot parts (coleoptile and first internode), and used a temperature\u2010based shoot\u2010growth model to separate the effects of soil temperature and soil strength on preemergent shoot growth.Preemergent shoot growth was sensitive to small differences in drying rate. Rapid drying resulted in no emergence, moderate drying in 52% emergence, and slow drying in 78% emergence. Soil strength impeded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15447514777769792982", "cites_id": ["15447514777769792982"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600040044x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1tWQj9iYYNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 7, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
