One approach, referred to as the single-point method, is based on accurate identification of the peak in the temperature-by-time measurements. The second approach involves a nonlinear model fit of the appropriate temperature model to the temperature-by-time data. In this paper, we analyze dual-probe heat-pulse data and show how the soil thermal properties determined using these two approaches compare. The single-point method is easy to apply, but results are sensitive to choice of the peak value, which can be difficult to identify if the data are sparse and contain noise. The nonlinear model fit (Marquardt method) copes better with broad, flat peaks and sparse, noisy data.
