In this study we use field measurements and a coupled soil heat and water flow model to demonstrate the effects of partial surface mulch on the near surface soil physical environment. The model is based on general physical laws and allows analysis of general system behaviour in response to changes in both inputs and systems variables. The field measurements were obtained on both a clay and a sand soil from experiments carried out in the semi-arid tropics. The treatments included a bare soil surface and 0 (completely mulched), 5 cm and 15 cm bare row zones. Both measurements and simulations showed that partial surface mulch cover can have dramatic effects on the soil physical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8425060683057411334", "cites_id": ["8425060683057411334"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00863561", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BjW_qA3U63QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
