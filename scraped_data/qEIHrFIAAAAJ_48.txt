Active and passive soil water samplers provide solute concentrations but give limited information on water fluxes. Mechanistic models are used to estimate leaching, but require calibration with measured data to ensure their reliability. Data from a drainage lysimeter trial under irrigation in which soil profile nitrate (NO3\u2212) concentrations were monitored using wetting front detectors (passive sampler) and ceramic suction cups (active sampler) were compared to NO3\u2212 concentrations in draining and resident soil water as simulated by the research version of the Soil Water Balance model (SWB-Sci). SWB-Sci is a daily time-step, cascading soil water and solute balance model that provides draining NO3\u2212 concentrations by accounting for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12046601937685716840", "cites_id": ["12046601937685716840"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837741000209X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aB9K_qIgLqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
