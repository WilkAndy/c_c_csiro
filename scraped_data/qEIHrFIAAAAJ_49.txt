There are numerous models that, under nonlimiting seedbed physical conditions, can adequately predict time to emergence using heat sums based on average daily temperatures. Under more adverse seedbed physical conditions, however, such as occur in the semiarid tropics, use of such coarse indices will tend to obscure the strong influence that even temporary extremes in soil temperature or strength can have on the time and extent of emergence, yet it is in these situations that final crop establishment and ultimately yield will be particularly sensitive to emergence predictions. One way to quantify the effect that temporary extremes in seedbed conditions have on emergence is to model the emergence process (namely, preemergent shoot growth). In this paper, we model preemergent maize (Zea mays L.) shoot growth as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3191050661244528762", "cites_id": ["3191050661244528762"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800030006x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:emjBY6vjSCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
