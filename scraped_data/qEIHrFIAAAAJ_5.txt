Reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to a lack of suitable instrumentation and appropriate theory. We developed a theory for the radial conduction of a short\u2010duration heat pulse away from an infinite line source, and compared it with the theory for an instantaneously heated line source. By measuring the temperature response at a short distance from the line source, and applying short\u2010duration heat\u2010pulse theory, we can extract all the soil thermal properties, the thermal diffusivity, heat capacity, and conductivity, from a single heat\u2010pulse measurement. Results of initial experiments carried out on air\u2010dry sand and clay materials indicate that this heat\u2010pulse method yields soil thermal properties that compare well with thermal properties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 382, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4584351411450382034", "cites_id": ["4584351411450382034"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800050002x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0oYP3VHjnj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 5, "1997": 0, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 9, "2003": 13, "2004": 7, "2005": 11, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 14, "2009": 16, "2010": 15, "2011": 12, "2012": 17, "2013": 12, "2014": 15, "2015": 18, "2016": 22, "2017": 22, "2018": 31, "2019": 30, "2020": 23, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
