These somewhat restrictive assumptions facilitate linearization of the highly non-linear SEBE and permit easy solution of the equation. The linearization techniques and the errors introduced by not accounting for the actual degree of surface wetness, are discussed. An algorithm which employs Newton's iterative method for solving the non-linearized SEBE is offered as an alternative method. It is shown that Newton's method is capable of dealing with the general form of the SEBE which accounts for any degree of surface wetness and that with few iterations one can obtain surface temperature to any desired degree of accuracy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11616521548136892994", "cites_id": ["11616521548136892994"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192387900153", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QspeEs0sNqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 3, "1990": 1, "1991": 4, "1992": 5, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
