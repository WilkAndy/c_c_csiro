Conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water is commonly practiced in this area, and cane yields are amongst the highest in the nation. However, water consumption per hectare is also high, due to low efficiency of the furrow irrigation system. More efficient irrigation practices would reduce pumping costs for growers, with less potential for salinity and leaching of nutrients and pesticides into the aquifer,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4060940764038019339", "cites_id": ["4060940764038019339"], "pub_url": "https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-ecology-and-the-environment/48/3096", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C7lj7htcWzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
