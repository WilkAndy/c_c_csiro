Solutes can move rapidly down the preferential flow paths with high pore-water velocities, but can be held in the less permeable region of the soil matrix with low pore-water velocities, thereby reducing the efficiency of leaching. In this study, we conducted leaching experiments with interruption of the flow and drainage of the main flow paths to assess the efficiency of this type of leaching. We compared our experimental results to a simple analytical model, which predicts the influence of the variations in concentration gradients within a single spherical aggregate (SSA) surrounded by preferential flow paths on leaching. We used large (length: 300 mm, diameter: 216 mm) undisturbed field soil cores from two contrasting soil types. To carry out intermittent leaching experiments, the field soil cores were first saturated with tracer solution (CaBr2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8900607909369045514", "cites_id": ["8900607909369045514"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772200000875", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CmL5crxPhXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
