We, the recipients of the Don and Betty Kirkham Award in Soil Physics, show how this legacy continues to affect soil physics. We describe eight longstanding or emerging research areas in soil physics that contain key unsolved problems. All are field oriented, with applications to a number of important issues in agriculture and the environment. The first three problems deal with the topic of characterization of field\u2010scale soil water properties, within which we describe progress on scaling, effective hydraulic properties, and the relationship between soil structure and function. We then move to the description of unstable flow and characterizing water repellency, and finish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3499923222111224111", "cites_id": ["3499923222111224111"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2011.0115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L4EUi6A5kjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
