Prediction of seedling response to seedbed strength requires an understanding of the manner in which soil strength develops during drying. Penetration resistance is an empirical estimate of the cavity expansion pressure required of the emerging seedling. However, use of penetration resistance to predict soil strength during drying is hampered by the greater error in penetration resistance vs. bulk soil strength measurements, uncertainty over the role of drying rate in strength development, and limitations in the theoretical basis of penetration resistance compared with other strength quantities.In this experiment we measured the penetration resistance, shear strength and tensile strength development during drying of a hardsetting red-brown earth following flood irrigation. The results showed first, that although penetration resistance had \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7076788364368322560", "cites_id": ["7076788364368322560"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016719879290108N", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AKDK4IXNNWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
