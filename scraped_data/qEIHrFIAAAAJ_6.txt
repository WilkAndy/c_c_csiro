Estimation of \u03c1c is accomplished by using a model for the conduction of heat away from an instantaneously heated infinite line source (IHILS). This study was conducted to examine possible errors in the use of the IHILS theory by comparing the IHILS model with three other models that account for the following characteristics of the heat pulse apparatus: finite probe length, cylindrical heater geometry, and short\u2010duration (noninstantaneous) heating. For typical probe geometry and heating times, estimates of \u03c1c obtained from the IHILS theory were within 1% of the estimates obtained by using the more rigorous models. The most significant error resulted from approximating short\u2010duration heating with instantaneous heating in the IHILS model. A generalized error analysis is presented that permits \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 330, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15562859367791624880", "cites_id": ["15562859367791624880"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700060008x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sIKUsiNi-tcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 9, "2003": 14, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 16, "2011": 18, "2012": 17, "2013": 17, "2014": 26, "2015": 19, "2016": 24, "2017": 12, "2018": 24, "2019": 13, "2020": 19, "2021": 14, "2022": 21, "2023": 4}}
