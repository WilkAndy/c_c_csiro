Given the potential water savings of AFI, a field experiment was conducted in the Tandojam region of Pakistan by growing okra with AFI and conventional furrow irrigation (CFI) in which every furrow is irrigated. Our results show that total irrigation water applied in the AFI treatment was roughly half (248 \u00b1 2.9 mm) that applied to the CFI treatment (497 \u00b1 1.7 mm). Despite the very significant reduction in irrigation water used with AFI there was a non-significant (p > 0.05) reduction (7.3%) in okra yield. As a result, we also obtained a significantly (p < 0.001) higher crop water productivity (CWP) of 5.29 \u00b1 0.1 kg m\u22123 with AFI, which was nearly double the 2.78 \u00b1 0.04 kg m\u22123 obtained with CFI. While this reduction in yield and/or potential income may appear small, it could be critical to the welfare of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3686265305913236421", "cites_id": ["3686265305913236421"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377416301512", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xRvO2sM-KDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
