Thermal properties are determined from temperature monitored by a sensing probe over time at a known distance from a line heat source. This study applies the dual-probe method to aqueous \u03b1-alumina colloidal suspensions, aqueous solutions of glycerol and saturated soil, which have known or independently determined thermal properties to validate the method. Good agreement was found between the measured temperature distribution and the temperature described by the infinite line-source analytical solution by using the known or independently determined thermal properties. The thermal properties of the materials were also estimated by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2491574483532296520", "cites_id": ["2491574483532296520"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Fulltext/1998/05000/TEST__OF_A_DUAL_PROBE_HEAT_PULSE_METHOD_FOR.2.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SLFetsrZkyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
