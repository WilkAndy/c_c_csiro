The ability of water footprints (WFs) to inform water resource management at catchment-scale was investigated on the Steenkoppies Aquifer, South Africa. Yields based on cropping areas were multiplied with season-specific WFs for each crop to determine blue and green water consumption by agriculture. Precipitation and evapotranspiration of natural vegetation and other uses of blue water were included with the agricultural WFs to compare water availability and consumption in a catchment sustainability assessment. This information was used to derive a water balance and develop a catchment WF framework that gave important insights into the hydrology of the aquifer through a simplified method. This method, which requires the monitoring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8455863784466257897", "cites_id": ["8455863784466257897"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717310148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Zczlk9DWXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
