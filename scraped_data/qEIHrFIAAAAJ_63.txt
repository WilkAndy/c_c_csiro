Field observations of soil temperature, water content and energy fluxes with and without surface crop residues are discussed and soil temperature data collected beneath strip mulches are summarized. Models developed to study the effects of strip mulches are reviewed and future research needs are considered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6333039358075424596", "cites_id": ["6333039358075424596"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19951902987", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VE-nBr5541cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
