While microplastics in marine environments have been extensively studied, research on microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems is just starting to gain momentum. In this paper, we used scientometric analysis to understand the current status of microplastic research in terrestrial systems. The global scientific literature on microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems, based on data from the Web of Science between 1986 and 2020, was explored with the VOSviewer scientometric software. Co-occurrence visualization maps and citation analysis were used to identify the relationship among keywords, authors, organizations, countries, and journals focusing on the issues of terrestrial microplastics. The results show that research on microplastics in terrestrial systems just started in the past few years but is increasing rapidly. Science of the Total Environment ranks first among the journals publishing papers on terrestrial microplastics. In addition, we also highlighted the desire to establish standards/protocols for extracting and quantifying microplastics in soils. Future studies are recommended to fill the knowledge gaps on the abundance, distribution, ecological and economic effects, and toxicity of microplastics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4669953097848494213", "cites_id": ["4669953097848494213"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/864886", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hZj-mpkBz0AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 13, "2022": 17, "2023": 12}}
