Currently, we lack detailed understanding of the transfer mechanism between the soil solution and overland flow, particularly under field conditions. A model of solute transfer from soil solution to overland flow was developed. The model is based on the hypothesis that a solute is initially distributed uniformly throughout the soil pore space in a thin layer at the soil surface. A fundamental assumption of the model is that at the time runoff commences, any solute at the soil surface that could be transported into the soil with the infiltrating water will already have been convected away from the area of potential exchange. Solute remaining at the soil surface is therefore not subject to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7948625623753976171", "cites_id": ["7948625623753976171"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(20000430)14:6%3C1139::AID-HYP5%3E3.0.CO;2-V", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a2lsJOQwT24J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
