We developed a furrow irrigation submodule for HYDRUS (2D/3D) and used it to evaluate the effects of different furrow soil surface treatments and different timings of fertigation on root water and solute uptake, deep drainage and solute leaching in a loamy soil. Numerical simulations showed that more water was available for transpiration in the treatments with plastic placed at the furrow bottom compared to the control treatments. However, more water was lost due to evaporation and less water was drained from the soil profile for these treatments. The highest and lowest root solute uptake was achieved when fertigation was applied in the middle and at the beginning of the irrigation cycle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15553198929376843139", "cites_id": ["15553198929376843139"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00271-015-0487-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gxV-mgUQ2NcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
