Both are driven by the increasing need to expand global food production. However, the historical neglect of consideration of water and nutrient uptake processes below ground has created a knowledge gap concerning the plant responses of nutrient and water limitations to crop production. The review includes sections on (i) notation and definitions of water potential, (ii) the physical coupling of plant transpiration and plant assimilation by way of the principles of diffusion of water vapor and carbon dioxide, (iii) apoplastic and symplastic water and nutrient pathways in plants, (iv) active and passive nutrient uptake, and (v) a discussion of the current state-of-the-art in multidimensional soil water flow and chemical transport \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 268, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1374746641233593722", "cites_id": ["1374746641233593722"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211302770144", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:esXjVskUFBMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 8, "2005": 7, "2006": 10, "2007": 8, "2008": 21, "2009": 16, "2010": 9, "2011": 13, "2012": 17, "2013": 27, "2014": 18, "2015": 19, "2016": 10, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 15, "2020": 17, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
