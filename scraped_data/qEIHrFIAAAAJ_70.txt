These two\u2010region models commonly ignore concentration gradients within the regions. Our objective was to develop a simple model to assess the influence of concentration gradients on solute transport and to compare model results with experiments conducted on structured materials. The model calculates the distribution of solutes in a single spherical aggregate surrounded by preferential flow paths and subjected to alternating boundary conditions representing either an exchange of solutes between the two regions (a wet period) or no exchange but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11183018695278108732", "cites_id": ["11183018695278108732"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1999.634759x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PKCa0EAQMpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
