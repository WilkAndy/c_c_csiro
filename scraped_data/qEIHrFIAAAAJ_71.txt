Evapotranspiration of irrigation water, displacement of unsaturated zone solutes, enhanced mixing with relict seawater and seawater intrusion are mechanisms considered to explain the observed increase. The floodplain aquifer is comprised of complex successions of Quaternary terrigenous and marine sediments hosting groundwater with Cl\u2212 concentrations from <50mg/l to >50,000mg/l. The lowest salinity groundwater is found adjacent to the Burdekin River and within palaeochannels dissecting the floodplain. Cl\u2212 concentrations <100mg/l, together with NO3-/Cl mass ratios >0.1 indicate the fresh groundwater originates from vertical infiltration of rainwater and irrigation water entrained with agricultural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2047598776532794815", "cites_id": ["2047598776532794815"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410003446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v_3CFT2IahwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
