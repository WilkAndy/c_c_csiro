Insight into the influence of a mulched inter-row zone on the conditions in a bare row zone was sought by examining the seedling response of maize to soil physical conditions across a sharp boundary between bare soil and mulched soil. The data were collected in the semi-arid tropics at Katherine, N.T., using coconut fibre matting as a mulch on a loamy sand and a clay loam soil.Mulching increased shoot growth rate before and after emergence. Surface mulch also increased the length of the first internode, thereby positioning the apical meristem of the plant at a shallower depth in mulched soil.The differences in the response of the plant are consistent with the higher maximum and longer exposure to high temperature in the bare soil. When maximum soil temperature at 25 mm was > 37\u00b0C, pre-emergent shoot growth declined rapidly and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3444232660316065833", "cites_id": ["3444232660316065833"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016719879090078R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KRDwMVtfzC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 16, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
