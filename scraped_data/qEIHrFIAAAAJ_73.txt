While small scale emerging and homestead subsistence farming are significant in the agricultural sector, food production is dominated by large scale commercial agriculture. In this paper we analyse the ecological impact of South African commercial crop production and what can be done about it. Impact categories considered are divided into what we consider \u2018better-researched\u2019 problems: fresh water depletion, salinisation, soil degradation, eutrophication and land use change; and into what we consider \u2018emerging\u2019 problems for agriculture: greenhouse gas emissions, soil profile acidification, ecotoxicity and non-renewable resource consumption. While there is a paucity of quantitative information, it is clear that after decades of cultivation many of our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14720834866790814308", "cites_id": ["14720834866790814308"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880916305680", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZFJAKFHpSswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 5}}
