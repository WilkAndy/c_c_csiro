However, just as built infrastructure delivers a range of socio-economic services that underpin modern societies, there is also an ecological infrastructure that maintains the provision of the ecosystem services that support a wide range of ecological as well as socio-economic benefits. Given the worsening water and food crises and increasing population pressures, one wonders why larger investments are not being made to ensure that our ecological infrastructure has the capacity to continue to produce sufficient flows of ecosystem services to satisfy the world\u2019s future needs. A large part of the answer to this question is, despite its importance, that the concept of ecological infrastructure is not yet widely recognised and understood. This paper highlights the importance of investing in the ecological infrastructure of soils. We begin by developing the concept of ecological infrastructure through a comparison of the key elements, systems and services that constitute built infrastructure and ecological infrastructure. We then highlight the role of soils as a fundamental element of ecological infrastructure. We highlight the importance of pore connectivity and soil water flow and transport as essential features of a robust and resilient soil ecological infrastructure that can be invested in, and enhanced, through carbon investment strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16055389393866164824", "cites_id": ["16055389393866164824"], "pub_url": "https://iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/1511.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WIr3r5Yz0N4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
