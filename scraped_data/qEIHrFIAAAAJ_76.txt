The maximum value of 82\u2009mg/L is to our knowledge the highest DOC reported for groundwater beneath irrigated cropping systems. More than half of the groundwater sampled in January 2004 (n\u2009=\u200946) exhibited DOC concentrations greater than 30\u2009mg/L. DOC was progressively lower in October 2004 and January 2005, with a total decrease greater than 90% indicating varying load(s) to the aquifer. It was hypothesized that the elevated DOC found in this groundwater system is sourced at or near the soil surface and supplied to the aquifer via vertical recharge following above average rainfall. Possible sources of DOC include organic\u2010rich sugar mill by\u2010products applied as fertilizer and/or sugarcane sap released during harvest.
