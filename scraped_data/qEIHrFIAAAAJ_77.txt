TDR equipment can be automated and multiplexed to acquire accurate and rapid waveforms (return signal) without safety concerns associated with radioactive methods (e.g., neutron probe and Gamma-ray probe). Two key steps are required for TDR applications: (1) Obtain and analyze TDR waveforms using travel-time and signal attenuation analysis to determine dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity, respectively. (2) Calibrate to determine a new- or apply an existing (e.g., Topp et al. (1980)) relationship between the derived soil dielectric permittivity and the volumetric water content of the porous medium of interest. A majority of researchers and practitioners focus on step two and additionally develop new mathematical models to get better estimates of water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1117270412833939496", "cites_id": ["1117270412833939496"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211321000316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KGAFW4VXgQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 17, "2023": 10}}
