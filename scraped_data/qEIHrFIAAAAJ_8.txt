Demand for these data is, however, on the increase because of improvements in and wider applications of soil heat and water transport models. Small dual-probe sensors have been developed that will assist to overcome this shortage in soil thermal property data, and in this paper, we demonstrate their capability through discussion of measurements carried out on unsaturated sandy soil which was subjected to a wetting and drying cycle. The dual-probes employ heat-pulse methodology and yield the soil thermal diffusivity, heat capacity and conductivity from a single heat-pulse measurement. Thermal properties measured in this study are compared with independent estimates made using standard procedures from the literature. These standard procedures require knowledge of the soil mineralogy, and our dual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 264, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4413183578433176263", "cites_id": ["4413183578433176263"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192397000658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x8IYIRXHPj0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 10, "2004": 1, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 11, "2009": 10, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 14, "2013": 13, "2014": 18, "2015": 14, "2016": 25, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 20, "2020": 22, "2021": 16, "2022": 9, "2023": 7}}
