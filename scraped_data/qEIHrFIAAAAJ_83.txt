The model here described links a soil heat and water model, a soil strength model, and a temperature\u2010dependent maize (Zea mays L.) shoot growth model to predict the response of preemergent maize seedlings to a physical environment typical of the semiarid tropics. In comparisons with field measurements taken in the semiarid tropics under high drying rate conditions, the model simulations yielded accurate representations of soil water, temperature, strength, and preemergent shoot growth of maize. The model was also used to compare the effects of radiation\u2010 vs. wind\u2010dominated evaporative demand on preemergent seedling growth in a hardsetting seedbed.
