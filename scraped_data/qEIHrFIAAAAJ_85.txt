To be able to estimate the consequences of SWR on vadose zone hydrology, it is important to determine soil hydraulic properties (SHP). Sequential modeling using HYDRUS (2D/3D) was performed on an experimental field site with artificially imposed drought scenarios (moderately M and severely S stressed) and a control plot. First, inverse modeling was performed for SHP estimation based on water and ethanol infiltration experimental data, followed by model validation on one selected irrigation event. Finally, hillslope modeling was performed to assess water balance for 2014. Results suggest that prolonged dry periods can increase soil water repellency. Inverse modeling was successfully performed for infiltrating liquids, water and ethanol, with R2 and model efficiency (E) values both> 0.9. SHP derived from the ethanol measurements showed large differences in van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters for the M and S plots compared to water infiltration experiments. SWR resulted in large saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) decrease on the M and S scenarios. After validation of SHP on water content measurements during a selected irrigation event, one year simulations (2014) showed that water repellency increases surface runoff in non-structured soils at hillslopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14654750178518843159", "cites_id": ["14654750178518843159"], "pub_url": "https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/johh-2018-0002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fz-1pqQhYMsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
