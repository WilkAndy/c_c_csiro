The slope of the WRC, or pore-size distribution index, is well described by the model but the bubbling pressure, or inflection point is poorly described. Without a good estimation of the bubbling pressure it is not possible to scale the physico-empirical model to the WRC. To achieve the scaling, a single measured point on the WRC in the unsaturated range is required. The resulting estimated water contents may be satisfactory for application within broad-scale leaching risk models and for generalised extrapolation of results from detailed experimental sites but caution is still required for quantitative applications of nitrate leaching models at a particular site. It is concluded that soil surveys could \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13288106243552485196", "cites_id": ["13288106243552485196"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/A97074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TJ-YoDnWaLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
