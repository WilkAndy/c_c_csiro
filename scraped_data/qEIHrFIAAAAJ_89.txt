Experimental work was carried out on several days during both the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. An exponential relationship (v = 4.09 e0.05x), with coefficient of determination r2 = 0.81, is found to exist between the J14 press and Scholander pressure chamber measurements. Both the Scholander pressure chamber and J14 press appear capable of following hourly variations in leaf water potential provided 8 and 16 leaves per sample are used for the two instruments respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12379134214123777866", "cites_id": ["12379134214123777866"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/32/4/851/556739", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Sm-78_qEy6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 2, "1983": 1, "1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
