The model has been programmed in BASIC and uses numerical methods suitable for microcomputer applications. It displays a fundamental coupling of the surface residue to the soil\u2014atmosphere system, and uses network analysis to describe heat and moisture transfer. Short-wave and long-wave radiative transfer, changes in energy status, rainfall interception by the residue, infiltration, redistribution, evaporation, and drainage are all accounted for. Daily input requirements include global short-wave radiation, maximum and minimum air temperatures, average wind speed, precipitation, and temperature and water content deep within the soil. General site, residue, and soil characteristics are also needed.Surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 255, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17460216025290845835", "cites_id": ["17460216025290845835"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192386900353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iy4LgfclT_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 4, "1986": 0, "1987": 5, "1988": 6, "1989": 6, "1990": 3, "1991": 10, "1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 9, "1995": 3, "1996": 15, "1997": 11, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 9, "2001": 6, "2002": 7, "2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 16, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
