Modeling irrigation, soil treatments, and leaching in these sodic soils requires a model that can adequately represent the physical and chemical changes in the soil associated with the amelioration process. While there are a number of models that simulate reactive solute transport, UNSATCHEM and HYDRUS-1D are currently the only models that also include an ability to simulate the impacts of soil chemistry on hydraulic conductivity. Previous researchers have successfully applied these models to simulate amelioration experiments on a sodic loam soil. To further gauge their applicability, we extended the previous work by comparing HYDRUS simulations of sodic soil amelioration with the results from recently published laboratory experiments on a more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12354392988567314546", "cites_id": ["12354392988567314546"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/vzj/article-abstract/11/2/vzj2011.0137/111554", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cqAhe_eec6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
