Decisions on whether to expand irrigation in northern Australia, and if so, where it should be located, and how it should be designed and managed require sound understanding of attributes of rivers and catchments and the risks and benefits associated with irrigation. Various studies and programs are underway to improve the understanding of northern catchments and their rivers.This study examines three well known but different irrigation areas in northern Australia and seeks to draw out key experiences and lessons relevant to existing and future irrigation in the North. The three focus areas are the: Lower Burdekin (LB), Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA), and Katherine-Douglas-Daly-Area (KDDA)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8191926610296685492", "cites_id": ["8191926610296685492"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cuan-Petheram/publication/268256694_Analysis_of_the_Lower_Burdekin_Ord_and_Katherine-Douglas-Daly_Irrigation_Areas_Implications_to_future_design_and_management_of_tropical_irrigation/links/54e32ce20cf2d90c1d9c2025/Analysis-of-the-Lower-Burdekin-Ord-and-Katherine-Douglas-Daly-Irrigation-Areas-Implications-to-future-design-and-management-of-tropical-irrigation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tMPNcNmRr3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
