In addition to the water that is applied solutes are also applied. These additional solutes which can come from various sources are often just dissolved in the irrigation water. Solutes can often be intentionally added to the water as a means of delivering nutrients to the plant, this is often termed fertigation (Solaimalai et al., 2005). Irrigation also leads to transport of solutes in the soil and landscape systems as the additional water flux provided by irrigation will result in changed patterns of solute distribution in soils and landscapes. These solutes are often intentionally added to the soil in the form of agrichemicals (including fertilisers), or were initially in the soil and are redistributed by irrigation.Irrigation is usually required for agriculture in regions where water is in limited supply due to the lack of precipitation during some part of the growing season. In arid climates the soils are often only inadequately drained and solutes may have accumulated in these soils from precipitation, even though solute concentrations in precipitation are low. When the additional water is added by irrigation to such soils salts are mobilised and can lead to the problem of salination of the landscape. Salination of soils globally results in the loss of 20 Mha of land per annum (Heuperman et al., 2002). Constant leaching of salt in irrigated soils is required if salination is to be prevented. This means that the salt has to be transported elsewhere, and can result in contamination of surface or groundwater."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9578604386568103825", "cites_id": ["9578604386568103825"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ccc8c8a79c55cfba9998998447dbbd417f46c833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kedjofAJ7oQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
