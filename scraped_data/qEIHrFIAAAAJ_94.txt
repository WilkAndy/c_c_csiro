A series of very dry years in this region in the early 1960\u2019s, and unprecedented pressures on the Burdekin delta groundwater systems led to commissioning of an artificial recharge scheme. Operating since the mid-1960\u2019s, the Burdekin Delta artificial recharge scheme is the oldest and largest in Australia. The scheme is largely responsible for supporting the highest yielding sugarcane area in Australia. The productivity and sustainability of the area relies on the recharge scheme to both supply irrigation water and to maintain pressure in the delta aquifer to withstand seawater intrusion. A coordinated research program (the Lower Burdekin Initiative) has been formed to ensure the long- term economic viability and sustainability of the region. Of particular interest is the rate of aquifer recharge and quality of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7405604050877608616", "cites_id": ["7405604050877608616"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003078838-72/burdekin-delta-australia-oldest-artificial-recharge-scheme-charlesworth-narayan-bristow-lowis-laidlow-mcgowan", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qPLAz6X9xWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
