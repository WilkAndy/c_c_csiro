We aim to circumvent the need to retrieve and dispose of plastic films by using water\u2010borne, degradable polymers that can be sprayed directly onto the soil surface to form a barrier to reduce soil water evaporation. We report the synthesis and characterization of a series of nonchain extended poly(urethane)s (PUs) for this purpose, that were prepared from poly(dimethylsiloxane) (928.3 g mol\u22121) and poly(ethylene glycol) (1020 g mol\u22121). These new materials undergo hydrophobic\u2010hydrophilic switching of their surface properties when in contact with water, which we exploit as a means of minimizing water evaporation from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=392773156697209467", "cites_id": ["392773156697209467"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/app.44756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e_o-4hppcwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
