This system is unique because it overlies major groundwater supplies, is close to environmentally sensitive wetlands, waterways, estuaries, and the Great Barrier Reef, and employs water management practices that have evolved over the last few decades in response to local needs. These practices include the use of riverbed sand dams, extraction of river water to distribution channels, natural waterways and large recharge pits to assist with artificial replenishment of the groundwater systems. Farm water practices such as\u201d recycling \u2018,'water spreading', and direct pumping from recharge channels have also evolved to play an integral role in the management of the groundwater systems. In this paper we describe a major new initiative in the Burdekin delta irrigation area involving a range of organisations and funding bodies. The aim of this initiative is to gain a better appreciation of current practices and their likely long-term impacts, and if necessary, to develop and implement new more effective water management practices at both the scheme and farm level. We highlight in particular approaches being employed to improve our understanding of links between onfarm management practices and response of the underlying groundwater systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10706041651450601587", "cites_id": ["10706041651450601587"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30651856/co_68_burdekin.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c-A_sSiAk5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
