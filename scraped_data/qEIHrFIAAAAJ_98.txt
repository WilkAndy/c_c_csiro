Simulation studies, using 100 years of historical weather data, have shown that maize and sorghum density at Katherine is rarely reduced by water deficit during crop establishment. However, the median number of days between 1 December and 20 January during which seedlings may be exposed to damagingly high soil temperature (>55\u00a6C between 2 and 7 days after sowing) was 5.5, out of an estimated 21 days suitable for sowing. While the exposure of a crop to inclement conditions during establishment may have immediate and dramatic effects on the mortality of pre \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2412582279416120393", "cites_id": ["2412582279416120393"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA9960971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SQQA_Mw2eyEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 5, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
