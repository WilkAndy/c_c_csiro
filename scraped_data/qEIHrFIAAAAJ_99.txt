The one method maintains the infiltration equation in its original form, while the other involves a mathematical transformation which introduces self-correlation and yields different estimates of the coefficients. Data from field infiltration experiments are used to illustrate these differences, and the need to distinguish between fitting data to empirical models and deriving system parameters from analysis of physically based models is emphasized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "qEIHrFIAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6580587077330699978", "cites_id": ["6580587077330699978"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9870369", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yobS1RTxUlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
