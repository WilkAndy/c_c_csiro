APSIM was developed to simulate biophysical process in farming systems, in particular where there is interest in the economic and ecological outcomes of management practice in the face of climatic risk. The paper outlines APSIM's structure and provides details of the concepts behind the different plant, soil and management modules. These modules include a diverse range of crops, pastures and trees, soil processes including water balance, N and P transformations, soil pH, erosion and a full range of management controls. Reports of APSIM testing in a diverse range of systems and environments are summarised. An example of model performance in a long-term cropping systems trial is provided. APSIM has been used in a broad \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 3072, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8974449026240246946", "cites_id": ["8974449026240246946"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030102001089", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:onTmN9eli3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 13, "2004": 37, "2005": 37, "2006": 62, "2007": 76, "2008": 89, "2009": 109, "2010": 142, "2011": 152, "2012": 163, "2013": 168, "2014": 171, "2015": 229, "2016": 206, "2017": 231, "2018": 222, "2019": 212, "2020": 194, "2021": 230, "2022": 209, "2023": 86}}
