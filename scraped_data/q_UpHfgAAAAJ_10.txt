Adaptation of previously developed crop models has resulted in multiple crop modules in APSIM, which have low scientific transparency and code efficiency. A generic crop model template (GCROP) has been developed to capture unifying physiological principles across crops (plant types) and to provide modular and efficient code for crop modelling. It comprises a standard crop interface to the APSIM engine, a generic crop model structure, a crop process library, and well-structured crop parameter files. The process library contains the major science underpinning the crop models and incorporates generic routines based on physiological principles for growth and development processes that are common \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 331, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13150446552772100590", "cites_id": ["13150446552772100590"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030102001004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7sG9N3fFf7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 19, "2009": 20, "2010": 24, "2011": 20, "2012": 17, "2013": 24, "2014": 21, "2015": 16, "2016": 16, "2017": 23, "2018": 28, "2019": 11, "2020": 12, "2021": 21, "2022": 18, "2023": 4}}
