The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) was used to simulate crop production and drainage passing the crop root zone in response to nitrogen application rates from 0 to 300kgNha\u22121year\u22121 using historical climate records from 1889 to 2002. The skills of SOI phases to forecast growing season rainfall and crop yield were analysed. The impact of nitrogen management based on historical climate knowledge, SOI phases and stored soil moisture was assessed. The results showed that while the optimal N rate for maximum economic return was around 150kgNha\u22121year\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4089683774730247020", "cites_id": ["4089683774730247020"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192308001846", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bJt5nLl5wTgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
