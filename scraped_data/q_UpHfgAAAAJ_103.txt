It can help select the most suitable cultivars in target regions and identify contributions of novel traits in crop breeding. In this study, we used the process-based APSIM-Canola model to investigate the G \u00d7 E \u00d7 M interactions for the purpose of increasing canola yield in contrasting climatic regions of China. A dataset with observations for nine cultivars and 30 site-years was used to test the performance of APSIM-Canola model. Two representative genotypes (as base cultivars) were used to simulate canola potential yield and evaluate potential contributions of putative traits to increase canola yield at three representative sites. Our results show that APSIM-Canola was able to simulate seed yield of both spring and winter canola \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4645778753089874458", "cites_id": ["4645778753089874458"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192317302836", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gqr6WikfeUAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
