This work analyzes the uncertainties in maize yield predictions using two crop models together with three climate projections downscaled with one regional climate model nested with three global climate models under the A1B emission scenario in northeast China (NEC). Projections were evaluated for the Zhuanghe agrometeorological station in NEC for the 2021\u201350 period, taking 1971\u20132000 as the baseline period. The results indicated a yield reduction of 13% during 2021\u201350, with 95% probability intervals of (\u221241%, +12%) relative to 1971\u20132000. Variance decomposition of the yield projections showed that uncertainty in the projections caused by climate and crop models is likely to change with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7696212482425001516", "cites_id": ["7696212482425001516"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/54/4/jamc-d-14-0147.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LJbe-nlwzmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
