Both observed and simulated yields showed large temporal and spatial variability due to variations in climate and irrigation supply. Wheat yield under full irrigation (FI) was 8 t\u2009ha\u22121 or higher in 80% of seasons in the north, it ranged from 7 to 10 t\u2009ha\u22121 in 90% of seasons in central NCP, and less than 9 t\u2009ha\u22121 in 85% of seasons in the south. Reduced irrigation resulted in increased crop yield variability. Wheat yield under supplemental irrigation, i.e., to meet only 50% of irrigation water requirement [supplemental irrigation (SI)] ranged from 2.7 to 8.8 t\u2009ha\u22121 with the maximum frequency of seasons having the range of 4\u20136 t\u2009ha\u22121 in the north, 4\u20137 t\u2009ha\u22121 in central NCP, and 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2882736308503088578", "cites_id": ["2882736308503088578"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-011-0440-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wo1yMWaJASgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
