Nitrous oxide emissions from soil are mainly due to denitrification. In this paper, we test sub-modules in the APSIM and DAYCENT models to simulate denitrification. The models were tested by comparison of predicted and measured N2O emission from an incubation experiment using 8.2 L soil cores. The N gas sub-modules in DAYCENT were based on the leaky pipe metaphor, that is, total N gas emissions are proportional to N cycling and gas diffusivity in the soil determines the relative amounts of N gas species emitted. The same approach was added to APSIM to enable simulation of N2O emission. The soil monoliths were irrigated three times during a two-week period and set on tension tables to control the suction at the base of each core. The results show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6447188596126018280", "cites_id": ["6447188596126018280"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706111001923", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6GoKmN4DeVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
