While previous studies have evaluated a range of impacts and adaptation of climate change (CC) on crop yield, few studies have focused on evaluating the effectiveness of changing cultivars with different vernalization requirements as an adaptation. In the present study, mean and inter-annual variability of yield were quantified for three winter wheat cultivar types at three ecological sites (Shangzhuang in Beijing, Quzhou in Hebei and Huangfanqu in Henan) in the North China Plain, by linking a crop model and the outputs of Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) for both the baseline (1961\u201390) and future SRES scenarios A2 and B2 (2070\u20132100). The results showed that a warming trend prolonged the length of the vegetative growth period of local cultivars through reduced vernalization, generally leading to a negative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13482809071957060696", "cites_id": ["13482809071957060696"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/using-apsim-to-explore-wheat-yield-response-to-climate-change-in-the-north-china-plain-the-predicted-adaptation-of-wheat-cultivar-types-to-vernalization/4F6D10EE4F240C7429FF026FC4332A25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WCxqfGqPHLsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
