In this paper, 3 distinct key development stages of sorghum that are related to ergot infection were identified: flag leaf stage, pollen starch accumulation stage, and flowering period. Relationships between weather variables during these 3 stages and ergot severity as well as pollen viability were analysed using observed data from 2 field trials, a serial planting trial and a genotype trial, conducted at Gatton, Queensland. The duration of the flag leaf stage and of the flowering period was estimated from thermal time. An infection factor was introduced and calculated based on hourly temperature during the flowering period. This infection factor and the mean relative humidity at 0900 hours during the flowering period were the main factors influencing ergot infection.
