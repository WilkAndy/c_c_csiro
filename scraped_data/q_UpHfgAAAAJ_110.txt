This study aims to quantify the contribution of altered sowing time windows to reduce climate risk for the production of oats (Avena sativa), a crop that is well adapted to short growing seasons and low rainfall. The APSIM-Oats model was calibrated and validated for phenology, above-ground dry matter and yield using data from field experiments with five sowing dates, conducted from 2009 to 2013 in Inner Mongolia, China. The model was used to determine yield trends and yield-limiting factors under rain-fed conditions using historical weather data. Changes in temperature had greater impact on crop production than changes in rainfall and the simulations indicated the importance of changed sowing windows \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:X5YyAB84Iw4C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2193031201792571972", "cites_id": ["2193031201792571972"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318304180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RLoxREI2bx4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 8}}
