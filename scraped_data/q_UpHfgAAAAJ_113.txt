To address this issue, this experimental project evaluated the performance of the dynamic modelling approach to key catchments in the Murray-Darling Basin, where statistical seasonal streamflow forecasts are currently available."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16558364462764496431", "cites_id": ["16558364462764496431"], "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/90181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L5aHuL8gy-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
