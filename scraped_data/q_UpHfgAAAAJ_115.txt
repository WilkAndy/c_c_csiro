The Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) plain produces \u223c1/3 wheat and maize of China with very high resource inputs, particularly synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers since the 1980\u202fs. Although fertilizer input has substantially increased crop yield and enhanced biomass carbon (C) input to the soil and thus stimulating soil C sequestration, GHG emissions (e.g., nitrous oxide (N2O)) relating to the fertilizers have been also dramatically increased. Yet, a systematic regional assessment on the trade-offs between crop yield, soil C sequestration and N2O emissions as impacted by management practices and environmental conditions is lacking. Here we calibrated a farming system model to conduct comprehensive assessment on crop yield and GHG emissions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:DQNrXyjhriIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8628626103207812312", "cites_id": ["8628626103207812312"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318301886", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2FxddbkJv3cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
