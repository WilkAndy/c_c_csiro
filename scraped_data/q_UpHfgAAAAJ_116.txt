The experiment was designed according to the local crop rotation and management system, consisting of a control treatment with no fertiliser application, a treatment with chemical nitrogen (N) and P fertilisers, and a treatment with chemical N and P fertilisers plus pig manure. The results suggest that the levels of local chemical fertiliser applications seem to balance the P removal by the crops, while the additional P in the pig manure resulted in substantial accumulation of P in the soil despite greater crop production. Analysis of Po fractions showed that long-term cultivation without fertilisation reduced the soil labile Po. Additions of P through application of chemical fertilisers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15691579423007221233", "cites_id": ["15691579423007221233"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR10169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8aUsAVmww9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
