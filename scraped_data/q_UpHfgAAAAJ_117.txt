The potential value of historical climate records increases exponentially with the number of years of data. In order to confidently quantify the long term optimal nitrogen application rate at the study site at least 30 years of climate data are required. For nitrogen management only, the potential value of a perfect climate forecast is about $54/ha/year with a reduction of excess nitrogen application of 20 kg N/ha/year. The value of an ENSO based forecast system is $2/ha/year. Perfect forecasting of three or six categories of growing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14910489642622744253", "cites_id": ["14910489642622744253"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9592-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vXarr1Sz7M4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
