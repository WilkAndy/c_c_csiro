While the solution to such societal problems may be largely political, there is a growing recognition of the need for science to provide sound information to decision-makers (Meinke et al., 2009). Achieving this, particularly in light of largely uncertain future climate and socio-economic changes, will necessitate integrated assessment approaches and appropriate integrated assessment modeling (IAM) tools to perform them. Recent (Ewert et al., 2009; van Ittersum et al., 2008) and ongoing (Rosenzweig et al., 2013) studies have tried to advance the integrated use of biophysical and economic models to represent better the complex interactions in agricultural systems that largely determine food supply and sustainable resource use.Nonetheless, the challenges for model integration across disciplines are substantial and range from methodological and technical details to an often still-weak conceptual basis on which to ground model integration (Ewertet al., 2009; Janssenet al., 2011). New generations of integrated assessment models based on well-understood, general relationships that are applicable to different agricultural systems across the world are still to be developed. Initial efforts are underway towards this advancement"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14059965851264363369", "cites_id": ["14059965851264363369"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-01606110/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aSu85nIIH8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
