A simulation study was carried out to assess the climate impact on the performance of a dryland wheat-fallow system and the potential value of seasonal climate forecasts in nitrogen management in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia. Daily climate data (1889\u20132002) from 57 stations were used with the agricultural systems simulator (APSIM) to simulate wheat productivity and nitrogen requirement as affected by climate. On a good soil, simulated grain yield ranged from <2 t/ha in west inland to >7 t/ha in the east border regions. Optimal nitrogen rates ranged from <60 kgN/ha/yr to >200 kgN/ha/yr \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7310301860984700314", "cites_id": ["7310301860984700314"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-008-0009-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mr3emM9oc2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
