This paper combined regional and field data with modeling to analyze the changes in the climate in the last 40 years, and to investigate the influence of changes in crop varieties and management options to crop yield. In particular, we examined the impact of a planned adaptation strategy to climate change -\u201cDouble-Delay\u201d technology, i.e., delay both the sowing time of wheat and the harvesting time of maize, on both wheat and maize yield. The results show that improved crop varieties and management options not only compensated some negative impact of reduced crop growth period on crop yield due to the increase in temperature, they have contributed significantly to crop yield increase. The increase in temperature before over-wintering \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14836786718344423672", "cites_id": ["14836786718344423672"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0385-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-CgnY-na5s0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 26, "2015": 26, "2016": 21, "2017": 29, "2018": 28, "2019": 36, "2020": 40, "2021": 20, "2022": 35, "2023": 12}}
