Here we first develop a paradigm that distils common stress patterns across environments, genotypes and climate horizons. Second, we embed improved process-based understanding into a farming systems model to discern changes in global crop waterlogging under future climates. Third, we develop avenues for adapting cropping systems to waterlogging contextualised by environment. We find that yield penalties caused by waterlogging increase from 3\u201311% historically to 10\u201320% by 2080, with penalties reflecting a trade-off between the duration of waterlogging and the timing of waterlogging relative to crop stage. We document greater potential for waterlogging-tolerant genotypes in environments with longer temperate growing seasons (e.g., UK, France, Russia, China), compared with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:I9gX6wnfuA8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8978168531521548985", "cites_id": ["8978168531521548985"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36129-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ubLuBrbcmHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 23}}
