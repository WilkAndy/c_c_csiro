A global assessment of soil denitrification rate, N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio, and their driving factors and mitigation strategies is lacking. We conducted a global synthesis using 225 studies (3367 observations) to fill this knowledge gap. We found that daily N loss through soil denitrification varied with ecosystems and averaged 0.25 kg N ha\u22121. The average emission factor of denitrification (EFD) was 4.8%. The average N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio from soil denitrification was 0.33. Soil denitrification rate was positively related to soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) (p < 0.01), nitrate (NO3-) content (p < 0.05) and soil temperature (p < 0.01), and decreased with higher soil oxygen content (p < 0.01). N2 emissions increased with latitude (p < 0.05), WFPS (p < 0.01) and soil mineral N (p < 0.05) but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:WMtz-WDmgKQC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11897288437913724211", "cites_id": ["11897288437913724211"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880921005545", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M6U1vMyoG6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 13}}
