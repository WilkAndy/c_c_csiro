This requires the model to correctly simulate the key physiological processes that determine grain yield. Although spike photosynthesis contributes to grain yield of wheat, it has not been explicitly simulated in most crop models. Here we present experimental data from China and Mexico, derived from estimates of spike contributions to grain yield of wheat, and compared them with previous results. We then used the APSIM model to investigate the consequences of excluding and including spike contributions on simulation results, against the data from China consisting of 4 irrigation and plant density treatments. Our results show that the contribution of spikes photosynthesis to grain yield ranged from 9.8% to 39 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:C-Rn0OCouf8C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9160556275257335168", "cites_id": ["9160556275257335168"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429020312156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gF2wy2XVIH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
