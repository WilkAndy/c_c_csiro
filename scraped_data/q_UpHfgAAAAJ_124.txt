The Agricultural Production system Simulator (APSIM) Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) uses a generic \u2018arbitration\u2019 approach to allocate biomass among plant organs. Crop models\u2019 handling of biomass partitioning is not often described in detail or explicitly tested, in spite of its central importance. Our aim was to describe and test the partitioning approach currently implemented in APSIM PMF. For that we used two experiments with maize and wheat crops where N supply was varied with different fertilizer application, and dry matter (DM) supplies were varied with different irrigation treatments. Detailed analysis of the models\u2019 predictions of biomass partitioning over the duration of these crops allowed for a number of improvements in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:qPeb-qHga9sC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10209624481527368755", "cites_id": ["10209624481527368755"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/insilicoplants/article-abstract/1/1/diy004/5479573", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MwySf1_fr40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
