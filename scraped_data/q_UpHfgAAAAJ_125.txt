One strategy being pursued is the development of wheat with enhanced organic anion release (mainly citrate) from the root system, which can solubilize soil-bound phosphorus (P) and increase the efficiency of P fertilizer uptake. Agricultural production system modeling, using a special purpose configuration of the APSIM modeling platform, was used to assess the potential long-term P fertilizer application savings for commercial wheat grown in three agro-ecological regions of Australia with varying conceptual levels of root citrate efflux enhancement. Life cycle assessment modeling (LCA) was subsequently used to quantify the potential environmental relevance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1433420354876847659", "cites_id": ["1433420354876847659"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X13000565", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K7Y_2jeI5BMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
