Crop data include timing of main developmental stages, aboveground biomass, grain yield, 1000-grain weight, grain number per spike, percentage filled grains, and plant density. The APSIM-Oryza model was used to quantify the rice cultivar changes and their impact on growth and yield. The results showed that cultivar changes could be explained by the changes in rice physiology captured in APSIM-Oryza and changes in yield components. Cultivar changes mainly involved: (1) the increase in actual thermal time requirements during the growing period as a result of reduced development rates and photoperiod sensitivity and extended grain filling period, which compensated the negative impact of warming to shorten growing period and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16227796155046953129", "cites_id": ["16227796155046953129"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429013001500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qQAG3Z-2NOEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
