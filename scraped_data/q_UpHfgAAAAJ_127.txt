An experiment was conducted to study the influence of meteorological factors on growth and development of hybrid rice in South China, in which seeds were sown at different sites at different dates in the spring. The 29 experimental sites were spread over a large area, with latitudes from 21 39\u2019to 34 16\u2019N and altitudes from 1.0 to 1862 m above sea level. It was found that the length of the growth period at low latitudes (21 to 25 N) was mainly determined by temperature and showed a single-peaked curve with an optimum temperature at about 25.7 C. The temperature response of development is almost linear at high latitudes (25 to 35 N), but the dependence is not as close and significant as that at low latitude, due to longer daylength and its higher variation.
