However, the performance of crop models for simulating crop root system has been rarely tested in many environments due to lack of detailed data on roots. In this paper, we present detailed measurement data on root biomass and distribution in 0\u2013200 cm soil profile at key developmental stages of wheat crop at Wuqiao in the North China Plain, and compare them with the root dynamics simulated by the agricultural systems model APSIM. The objectives are to test the model performance for simulating root biomass and distribution, and to investigate the potential impact of errors in root modelling on simulated wheat yield and soil carbon change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10833169566712026042", "cites_id": ["10833169566712026042"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429014000884", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ulNxB1MmV5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
