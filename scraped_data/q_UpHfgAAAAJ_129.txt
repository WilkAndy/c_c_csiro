However, it is unclear about the level of citrate efflux required to significantly impact on crop PUE in different soils. This paper presents a modelling approach to assess the field level impact of root exudates on crop PUE. The farming systems model, APSIM, was modified to include the effect of root citrate efflux on P availability in soil, crop P uptake and growth. With parameters derived from literature, the model was used to simulate the long-term impact of root citrate across soil and climatic conditions. Preliminary results showed contrasting long-term and short-term impacts due to either the accumulated effect of solubilisation or the depletion of soil P reserve. The major impact of enhanced citrate efflux is to increase the efficiency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=184032676573528754", "cites_id": ["184032676573528754"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815213000492", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ssI6ir7QjQIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
