A two-year experiment with two soil moisture by four N treatments was conducted to investigate the effects of N application rates and soil moisture on soil N dynamics, crop yield, N uptake and use efficiency in an intensive wheat\u2013maize double cropping system (wheat\u2013maize rotation) in the North China Plain. Under the experimental conditions, crop yield of both wheat and maize did\u2423not\u2423increase significantly at N rates above 200 kg N ha\u22121. Nitrogen application rates affected little on ammonium-N (NH4-N) content in the 0\u2013100 cm soil profiles. Excess nitrate-N (NO3-N), ranging from 221 kg N ha\u22121 to 620 kg N ha\u22121, accumulated in the 0\u2013100 cm soil profile at the end of second rotation in the treatments with N rates of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4447109478084736038", "cites_id": ["4447109478084736038"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-006-0055-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JnSDLoJOtz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 16, "2011": 15, "2012": 18, "2013": 11, "2014": 15, "2015": 16, "2016": 16, "2017": 15, "2018": 31, "2019": 26, "2020": 20, "2021": 28, "2022": 16, "2023": 9}}
