Soc. of Aust. and NZ Cairns", "abstract": "The development of a seasonal water availability service must be user driven-it must ultimately lead to changes in decisions that result in improved outcomes in water resource management. Critical to the development of this service will be a modelling infrastructure that will gradually build in complexity. Investment in modelling efforts will, to a large degree, be driven by scientific and technological capability, cost-benefit considerations, and most importantly, the likely incremental benefits of improved predictions and outcomes for water managers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8088541200680037443", "cites_id": ["8088541200680037443"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0050a474b4e8996d11735646eef0dfd983c8201d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qyyl-V1FQHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
