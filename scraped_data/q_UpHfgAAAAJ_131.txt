In spite of the importance, the impact of past climate change on wheat potential productivity and drought severity has not been properly addressed. In this study, we employed a relatively simple resource use efficiency model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of the potential productivity (PP) and rainfed productivity (RP) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Southwest China (SWC) from 1962 to 2010. A wheat drought severity index was defined as the relative difference between PP and RP, i.e., (PP-RP)/PP, to evaluate the changing frequency and severity of drought under warming SWC. Across the entire region from 1962 to 2010, the negative impact of decreasing sunshine hours (0.06 h day\u22121 per decade, p < 0.05) on PP was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=174379846276911411", "cites_id": ["174379846276911411"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-016-1895-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M5FS2YuFawIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
