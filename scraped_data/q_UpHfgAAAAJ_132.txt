The experiment consisted of seven fertiliser treatments: (1) unfertilised control, (2) annual application of P and K fertilisers, (3) N and K fertilisers, (4) N and P fertilisers, (5) N, P and K fertilisers, (6) N, K and second level P fertilisers, and (7) N, P and second level K fertilisers. Without fertiliser, the Mollisols could support an average yield of 1.88 t ha\u22121 for wheat, 3.89 t ha\u22121 for maize and 2.12 t ha\u22121 for soybean, compared to yields of 3.20, 9.30 and 2.45 t ha\u22121 respectively for wheat, maize and soybean if the crop nutrient demands were met. At the potential yield level, the N, P and K removal by wheat are 79 kg N ha\u22121, 15 kg P ha\u22121, and 53 kg K ha\u22121, by maize are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=917076876896449473", "cites_id": ["917076876896449473"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-010-9401-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wTMjh48cugwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
