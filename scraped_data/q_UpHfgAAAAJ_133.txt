However, grain yield of winter wheat is often threatened by drought, leading to a high risk of yield. Assessment on yield risk and study on how to reduce yield risk by appropriate irrigations could provide suitable instructions for irrigation management and increasing yield. By using the simulation model APSIM, taking Beijing and Yucheng as case study areas, yield risk of winter wheat in those two areas were evaluated firstly. Then irrigation schemes were designed and their contributions to reduce yield risk in different rainfall years were analyzed. Results indicated that in most years, rainfall could not meet the requirement of wheat, and in 30% of years water shortage reached serious degree. In serious drought years, yields of winter wheat were only 2 445 and 2 466 kg/hm2 in Beijing and Yucheng, respectively. After irrigation, yield risk \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14819720263871295640", "cites_id": ["14819720263871295640"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tcsae/tcsae/2009/00000025/00000010/art00007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mPC0zg85qs0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
