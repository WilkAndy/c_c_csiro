However, little is known about the influence of variability in crop management on model outputs. A constant and uniform crop management is often considered over the simulated area and period. This study determines the influence of crop management adapted to climatic conditions and input data resolution on regional-scale outputs of crop models. For this purpose, winter wheat and maize were simulated over 30 years with spatially and temporally uniform management or adaptive management for North Rhine-Westphalia (\u02dc34 083 km\u00b2), Germany. Adaptive management to local climatic conditions was used for 1) sowing date, 2) N fertilization dates, 3) N amounts, and 4) crop cycle length. Therefore, the models were applied with four different management sets for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:3vbIHxFL9FgC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6079038434366706326", "cites_id": ["6079038434366706326"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192319301844", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ltJfeD8VXVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
