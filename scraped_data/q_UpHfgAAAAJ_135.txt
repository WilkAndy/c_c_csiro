Soil C modelling is the only reasonable approach available for predicting soil C dynamics under future conditions of environmental changes, and soil C models are usually constrained by the average of observations. However, model constraining is sensitive to the observed data, and the consequence of using observed averages on C predictions has rarely been studied. Using long-term soil organic C datasets from an agricultural field experiment, we constrained a process-based model using the average of observations or by taking into account the variation in observations to predict soil C dynamics. We found that uncertainties in soil C predictions were masked if ignoring the uncertainties in observations (i.e., using the average of observations to constrain model), if \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7473529043451166402", "cites_id": ["7473529043451166402"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216300330", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wr54jRFPt2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
