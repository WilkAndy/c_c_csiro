However, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in agro-ecosystems is affected by complex interactions of various factors including climate, soil and agricultural management practices, which hinders our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The objectives of this study were to use the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model to simulate the long-term SOC dynamics under different management practices at four long-term experimental sites, Zhengzhou and Xuzhou with double cropping systems and Gongzhuling and \u00dcr\u00fcmqi with single cropping systems, located in northern China. Firstly, the model was calibrated using information from the sites and literature, and its performance to predict crop growth and SOC dynamics was examined. The calibrated model was then used to assess the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4707038221590317918", "cites_id": ["4707038221590317918"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016014600394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XssT1lLCUkEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
