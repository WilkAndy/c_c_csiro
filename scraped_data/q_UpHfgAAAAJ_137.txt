Due to the concentrated summer monsoon rainfall and inter-annual climate variability, irrigation is required to support the high productivity of the wheat-maize system, especially for the wheat crop and in the northern part of the plain, where excessive use of ground-and surface water for irrigation has caused rapid decline of groundwater tables and severe reduction of available surface water from the Yellow River. The productivity of the double cropping system and its reliance on decreasing water supplies under the variable climate need to be assessed. There is still a lack of systematic studies on how the productivity of the wheat-maize system could respond to different levels of reduced irrigation water supply.A modeling approach is used in this study to analyze the response of wheat and maize productivity to climate variability and irrigation in the NCP. Firstly, we calibrated and evaluated the farming systems model APSIM for simulating the wheat-maize double cropping system with detailed field experiments conducted at three experimental sites (Luancheng, Yucheng and Fengqiu), which can represent the conditions of climate, soil and crop production in the NCP. The experiments covered 31 crop growing seasons, four genotypes of wheat and four of maize, and detailed measurements of leaf area index (LAI), above-ground biomass, grain yield, soil water and evapotranspiration (ET). The validated model was then applied to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7283052141350643536", "cites_id": ["7283052141350643536"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=01e6319a187612b4cef6e987fc1871a11dd7fd12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UGfa1VWZEmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
