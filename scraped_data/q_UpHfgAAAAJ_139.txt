Combining measurements and modelling together help assess the consequences of these interactions, identify knowledge gaps and improve understanding of these processes. Here, we present a dataset (collected in a two-month fallow period) and list potential issues related to use of the APSIM model in predicting fluxes of soil water, heat, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C). Within the APSIM framework, two soil water modules (SoilWat and SWIM3) were used to predict soil evaporation and soil moisture content. SWIM3 tended to overestimate soil evaporation immediately after rainfall events, and SoilWat provided better predictions of evaporation. Our results highlight the need for testing the modules using data that includes wetting and drying cycles. Two soil temperature modules were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:BW2nPTmhBn4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16903927964011641184", "cites_id": ["16903927964011641184"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr19021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YLm0I-zQluoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
