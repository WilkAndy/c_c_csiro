For more efficient and sustainable utilization of the limited water resources, improved understanding of how crop productivity and water balance components respond to climate variations and irrigation is essential. This paper investigates such responses using a modelling approach. The farming systems model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) was first calibrated and validated using 3 years of experimental data. The validated model was then applied to simulate crop yield and field water balance of the wheat\u2013maize rotation in the NCP. Simulated dryland crop yield ranged from 0 to 4.5tha\u22121 for wheat and 0 to 5.0tha\u22121 for maize. Increasing irrigation amount led to increased crop yield \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 231, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9792648050422677765", "cites_id": ["9792648050422677765"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837740800317X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BYHdp4R55ocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 15, "2012": 17, "2013": 10, "2014": 19, "2015": 25, "2016": 18, "2017": 14, "2018": 24, "2019": 24, "2020": 19, "2021": 19, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
