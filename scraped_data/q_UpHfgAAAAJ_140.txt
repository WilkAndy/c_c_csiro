These examples show that models have tremendous potential and value in enhancing site\u2010specific water management for different soils and climates, and evaluating cropping system sustainability over the longer term, when model results are integrated with the available field measurements in experimental studies. Here we summarize applications of 11 system models commonly reported in the literature for agricultural water management along with those presented in this volume. These 11 models vary greatly in simulating agricultural system components for water balance related processes (the differences in crop growth and N balance processes were even greater among models), which need to be kept in mind when reading about \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14316895625104472789", "cites_id": ["14316895625104472789"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/advagricsystmodel5.c15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1TqyhLfUr8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
