Management such as stubble retention (SR), conservation tillage (ZT), and fertilization are recommended for both promoting production and accumulating SOC. However, whether such management practices can cause net increase in SOC or just a slow-down of SOC decline largely depends on the current status of SOC for a given region. This paper synthesized the available SOC data in the croplands of China, and analysed the change of SOC in the top 20 cm soil as a result of management change. The results showed that, on average, SOC increased by 18.3% through SR, by 9.1% through ZT, and by 12.4%, 36.9% and 41.5% through application of inorganic (IF), organic (OF) and combined inorganic and organic fertilizers (IOF), respectively, compared to those under stubble removal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3025478072908046152", "cites_id": ["3025478072908046152"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002016013600648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SN9qE0eo_CkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
