Method: The well-calibrated and validated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator Model (APSIM) on a region scale was used to assess spring maize potential yields at different levels, and spatial-temporal characteristics of potential yield and yield gaps between different levels in Heilongjiang province from 1981-2010, based on the weather, phenology, management practices and soil data. Result: In the study area, the spatial distribution of maize potential yield was similar to sunshine hours in maize growing season, which was higher in west than in east. The potential yield of maize showed an inconsistent trend during the past 30 years. The distribution of rain-fed yield was similar to the precipitation during maize growing season, and showed a positive association with precipitation. The rain-fed yield was in the order of central> east> west. The rain-fed yield was lower and unstable in the region with lower precipitation. The rain-fed yield in 82% of the selected stations showed a decreasing trend during the past 30 years. Instability of rain-fed yield was higher than potential yield. Qiqihaer and Suihua city showed lower values of climate-soil productivity. In the past 30 years, the yield gap caused by precipitation showed an increasing tendency, indicating the aggravated risk of drought. Conclusion: The precipitation is the key constraints factor on yield in the West of Heilongjiang province, and yield could be increased by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2433637308227965242", "cites_id": ["2433637308227965242"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20123238915", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OtEQ5TwExiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
