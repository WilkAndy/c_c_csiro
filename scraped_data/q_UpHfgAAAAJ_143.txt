As a result, there is a need to better understand the effectiveness of P management strategies, especially in Vertisols that represent a large proportion of the cropped area. The complexity of soil P dynamics and the interaction with environmental factors and farming practices make this challenging but the use of agricultural systems models such as the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) can potentially improve our understanding of these interactions. This study (1) gives the state of knowledge of P behaviour in Vertisols and identifies which soil P processes are simulated in the APSIM Soil-P module, (2) tests the ability of APSIM as a tool to simulate soil P dynamics and crop responses in two long-term P studies in Vertisols, and (3) discusses future work needed to improve modelling of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Nnq8S6OXqDYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=801148095441537436", "cites_id": ["801148095441537436"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429021002483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nAlGufI_HgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 10}}
