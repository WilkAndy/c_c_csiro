The management strategies should be context-specific, and will require consideration of different stakeholders\u2019 interests, and of the local soil and climatic conditions. We developed a framework to analyse nitrogen (N) management options with the objective of increasing crop production while reducing CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil, and applied this framework to Australian rainfed wheat systems using a systems modelling approach. The results indicated that modified N management strategies in Australian rainfed wheat systems could increase average grain yield by up to 76% (from 1.7 to 3.0 Mg ha\u22121) while substantially reducing net soil and N2O emissions (expressed in CO2 equivalents, CO2-eq), compared with current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15482111983899999398", "cites_id": ["15482111983899999398"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192316303872", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pnwtVdKC29YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
