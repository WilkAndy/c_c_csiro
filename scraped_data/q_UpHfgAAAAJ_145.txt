Opportunistically sowing summer forage crops within winter cereal rotations could be a flexible means of reducing this deep drainage whilst achieving additional livestock production. A simulation-based feasibility study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of summer forage cropping in altering the water balance and to predict any adverse effects on winter crop yield. At the study location in southern New South Wales an average of 37% of the 557mm annual rainfall falls outside wheat growing season, i.e., in the summer fallow period. Summer cowpea crops planted in the fallow period were predicted to yield 1.3t/ha of biomass on average (range of 0\u20135.7t/ha) if sown every year. Crops failed to establish in 1 year out of 5, and predicted yield failed to exceed 1.0t/ha in 52 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7358593716408653859", "cites_id": ["7358593716408653859"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880907002903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I5j1YP_5HmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
