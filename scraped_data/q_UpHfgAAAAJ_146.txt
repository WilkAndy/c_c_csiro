For the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize in the North China Plain (NCP), irrigation management in the dry winter wheat growing season affects the water balance in the summer rainy maize growing season and therefore influences the water drainage and N leaching from the crop root zone. Measurement data from a field experiment with three irrigation schedules for winter wheat and maize from 2006 to 2009 were used to calibrate and validate the APSIM model (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator). The evaluated model was used to simulate the long-term effects of different irrigation schedules for the winter wheat season on N leaching during the summer maize season from 1981 to 2018, and to investigate strategies with minimum irrigation to maintain crop yield while \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Gb6Hms-Uo9kC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5287880586289481563", "cites_id": ["5287880586289481563"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429021000563", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wwd4eGBTYkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
