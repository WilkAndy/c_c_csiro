In this study, we investigated how row configuration (e.g. the proportion of border rows) affected light interception (LI) and light use efficiency (LUE) in maize (Zea mays L.)/ peanut (Arachis hypogaea Linn.) strip intercropping. Field experiments were carried out for two years in 2015 and 2016. Four intercropping treatments were set as M2P2 (two rows maize and two rows peanut), M4P4, M6P6 and M8P8, with border-row proportion (BRP) of 1, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.25 under an equal land use proportion (0.5 for each crop). Two monocultures, sole maize and sole peanut (with BRP of 0), were set as controls. The LI was estimated by a light interception model developed for strip intercropping. Both light \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:CRzUtm-VnGAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11174538608362448470", "cites_id": ["11174538608362448470"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429021001854", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VuZUuKjvE5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
