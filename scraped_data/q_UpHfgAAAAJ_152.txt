Measurements and model simulations of nitrification and associated N 2 O emission are challenging. Here we innovatively integrated data mining and machine learning to predict nitrification rate () and the fraction of nitrification as N 2 O emissions (). Using our global database on  and , we found that the machine-learning based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) model outperformed three widely used process-based models in estimating  and N 2 O emission from nitrification. We then applied the SGB technique for global prediction. The potential  was driven by long-term mean annual temperature, soil C/N ratio and soil pH, whereas  by mean annual precipitation, soil clay content, soil pH, soil total N.
