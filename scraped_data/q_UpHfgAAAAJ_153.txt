The general consensus is that global warming shortens the overall length of wheat growing period and reduces global wheat yield. Here, focusing on China, the largest wheat producer in the world, we show that warming increases wheat yield in most winter wheat growing regions in China. We collated data from field experiments under stress-free conditions and artificial warming from 12 locations over China to assess the impact of warming on wheat yield. The data cover 14 wheat cultivars, 27 site-years, and a range of growing season temperatures from 7.5 C to 17.2 C. Our results indicate that warming up to+ 3 C increased winter wheat yield by 5.8% per C (change rate of yield/average of yield), while reduced spring wheat yield by 16.1% per C. Although artificial warming reduced the total growth duration, warming-induced longer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:NU-BerS4NX4C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18399423440598634491", "cites_id": ["18399423440598634491"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abc71a/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-4_giCLiV_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
