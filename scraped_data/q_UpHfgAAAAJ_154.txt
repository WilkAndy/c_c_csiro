This project sought to assist grain grower and catchment management groups target land use change so that catchment salt and water targets could be met at least-cost. The research was undertaken in the Simmons Creek catchment which exports salt into Billabong Creek near Walbundrie in southern New South Wales.The project developed and applied catchment bio-economic analysis that combined a conceptual model of catchment groundwater and salinity, farming systems modelling, and spatially explicit economic optimisation. This framework gave insight into the interactions and tradeoffs between catchment environmental services (water yield) and costs (salt load), and farm level production and economics. It showed where land use change is needed, the degree of land use change, and the cost of land use change to meet given salinity and water yield targets at least-cost. The model selects an arrangement of land use that preserves as much highly productive and profitable land use as possible."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7682309684733156915", "cites_id": ["7682309684733156915"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Nordblom/publication/265239286_HP_Cresswell_Catchment_Response_to_Farm_Scale_Land_Use_Change/links/5564076a08ae86c06b695cc1/HP-Cresswell-Catchment-Response-to-Farm-Scale-Land-Use-Change.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mx4QpfQLnWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
