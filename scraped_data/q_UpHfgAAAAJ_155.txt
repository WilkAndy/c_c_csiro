Better knowledge of such variability combined with probabilistic forecasting capabilities is valuable for agricultural decision making at the farm, marketing or policy level. Agricultural simulation models can help to add value to this improved understanding of climate variability and are used to objectively assess management options. Decisions based on such tools ranges from short-term, tactical crop management options to policy decisions about future land use. At the strategic level they allow answers to questions such as: Are the current cropping systems in Australia best suited for their individual region\u2019s climate variability? How will these systems perform over the next few decades? This systems analytical approach is at the centre of several research projects that evaluate and compare current cropping systems against the background of climatic variability at various time scales. Although knowledge of likely temperature ranges (and particularly high and low temperature thresholds) can also influence agricultural decisions, our focus for this paper is on rainfall variability, which is still the major source of yield fluctuations in Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10955253483642331055", "cites_id": ["10955253483642331055"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G-Hammer/publication/43463092_Understanding_climate_variability_to_improve_agricultural_decision_making/links/5d58c0d2299bf151badcdcf0/Understanding-climate-variability-to-improve-agricultural-decision-making.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r5_c_P_gCJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
