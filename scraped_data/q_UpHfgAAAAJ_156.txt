A set of rules based on overseas research on the influence of environmental factors on infection and sporulation was used to interrogate daily climatic data from 1957 to 1998 for 53 selected localities. Between November and February, sorghum was at arelatively low risk of infection from downy mildew, with the risk gradually increasing during the summer, reaching the greatest risk in May for most localities. During March to May there were geographical south-north, as well as west-east, increasing gradients of predicted downy mildew events in Queensland and New South Wales. In winter and early spring, the analysis indicated that disease would occur only in the coastal regions of Queensland, with serious implications for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2437778652710824399", "cites_id": ["2437778652710824399"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1071/AP00019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z-nby8S61CEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
