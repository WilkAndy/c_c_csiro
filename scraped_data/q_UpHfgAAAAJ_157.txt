Optimizing potato planting date and cultivar maturity is of great importance for increasing yield and reducing yield variability in North China. The APSIM-Potato model was calibrated and validated with field experimental data from a 2-year \u0445 3-planting dates \u0445 3-cultivars study, and used to determine the optimal combinations of planting date and cultivar maturity for rainfed potato production in North China. APSIM-Potato performed well in simulating phenology (mean RMSE = 3.6 days), soil water content in the 0\u2013100 cm soil profile (mean RRMSE = 23.5 %), total dry matter (mean RRMSE = 26 %), and fresh potato yield (mean RRMSE = 22.5 %) under different combinations of planting date and cultivar maturity. Simulated rainfed fresh potato yield in North China was 16,407 \u00b1 6432 kg ha\u22121.
