While traditional soil moisture measurements are done using point-based methods, the recent development of the cosmic-ray soil moisture neutron sensor (CRNS) offers the opportunity to measure soil water at the field scale. However, due to its shallow (<300\u202fmm) and variable measurement depth, the relevance of the measurements to crop water use has been questioned. In this paper, we combine point-based soil moisture measurements (soil cores, TDR), areal-based soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements (CRNS, eddy covariance), and soil-plant systems modelling together to investigate the consistency in measured soil moisture and crop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:oqD4_j7ulsYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14854443445172137064", "cites_id": ["14854443445172137064"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377418303871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aGyddZyVJc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
