Continual nutrient input and residue retention are needed to attain the C sequestration potential and to maintain the sequestered C. However, few studies have assessed the vulnerability of the sequestered soil C to changes in agricultural management and climate. Here we applied the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the soil C dynamics to equilibrium under optimal management with 100% residue retention and no nitrogen (N) deficiency at 613 sites across the Australian croplands. We examined the response of sequestered soil C to potential warming and rainfall change, under these optimal practices and under suboptimal management with reduced residue retention and/or N input. On average, soil C was lost at rate of 0.14 Mg C ha\u2212 1 yr\u2212 1 when residue \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5526661535957042598", "cites_id": ["5526661535957042598"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706116300155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:psWIrGKlskwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
