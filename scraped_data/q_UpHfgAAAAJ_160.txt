In this paper, we combined spatial measurements from 2157 soil samples and geostatistical analysis to assess the spatiotemporal changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium content (AK) from the first soil survey (in the 1980s) to the second soil survey (in the 2000s) in the Taihu region of Jiangsu Province in China. The results showed that average soil nutrients in three soil types all exhibited the increased levels in the 2000s (except for AK in the yellow brown soil). The standard deviation of soil nutrient contents increased (except for TN in the paddy soil). Agricultural production in the 20 years led to increases in SOC, TN, AP and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:adHtZc2wMuEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7844961204315539994", "cites_id": ["7844961204315539994"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311913605286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gsryo6bm3mwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
