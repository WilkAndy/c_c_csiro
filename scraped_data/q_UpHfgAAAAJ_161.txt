The relative efficiency of intercropping depends on row configuration, but there is a shortage of modelling-based evaluation of alternative intercropping options due to the inadequacy of standard process-based crop models to simulate resource capture, growth and yield formation when the canopy is spatially structured in strips. We implemented a light interception model for strip crops into the APSIM Classic model and combined it with a quasi-Bayesian approach to derive the model parameters to simulate crop growth and grain yield in maize-soybean strip intercropping. We used 4 years of field data for 5 different row configurations to derive key model parameters for simulation of light interception, LAI dynamics, biomass growth and grain yield of maize and soybean intercrops \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:QKtdBID3u5MC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14882157269118053798", "cites_id": ["14882157269118053798"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842902100068X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pm1H7S8LiM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
