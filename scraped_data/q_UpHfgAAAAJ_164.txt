This paper describes an approach to quantify the value of \u2018perfect\u2019 climate forecasts to direct nitrogen management in a wheat\u2010cropping system at two Australian locations with contrasting annual rainfall. For annual wheat\u2010cropping systems, and compared with the N management based on optimal N rate derived from long\u2010term climatic conditions, N management based on \u2018perfect\u2019 climate forecasts can lead to an average benefit of $ 65.2/ha/year at Walbundrie (annual rainfall 560.0 mm) and $ 66.5/ha/year at Wanbi (annual rainfall 314.5 mm). Generally, the economic benefit is highest in extreme (wet and dry) years and lowest in normal years. At the high rainfall site Walbundrie, where average N\u2010application rate is high, the maximum yearly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2170038912587025794", "cites_id": ["2170038912587025794"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.1520", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gk2GxeSGHR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
