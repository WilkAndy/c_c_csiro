Better understanding of biomass and P accumulation, partition, and remobilization processes will improve modeling of crop resource use. However, there is still a lack of detailed data to parameterize the modeling of these processes, particularly for modern maize cultivars. A two-year (2016 and 2017) field experiment with three P fertilization treatments (0 (P0), 75 (P75), and 300 (P300) kg P2O5 ha\u22121) was conducted on a Fluvo-aquic soil (Quzhou, Hebei province, China) to collect data and quantify key processes for a representative modern maize cultivar (Zhengdan 958) widely grown in China. The proportions of biomass and P partitioned into various maize organs were unaffected by P application rate. Zhengdan 958 showed a much lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:3BvdIg-l-ZAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7623265276628357391", "cites_id": ["7623265276628357391"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214514121000702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D9EAGmFHy2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
