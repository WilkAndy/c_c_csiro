Water and carbon dioxide fluxes from an irrigated wheat-maize double-crop field from November 2002 to October 2003 were measured using the Eddy Covariance method. Evident differences were observed between the diurnal patterns of WUE for wheat and maize. The WUE values of wheat peaked near 9, 15 and 12 mg CO2 g H2O in the morning, and then decreased linearly with time and recovered in the late afternoon (4:00pm) before sunset in March, April and May, respectively. The WUE of maize increased after sunrise and retained stable values of 6, 14 and 12 mg CO2 g H2O from mid-morning to mid-afternoon (10:00am \u20132:00pm) and then decreased slowly with time until sunset in July, August and September, respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10990757393173962230", "cites_id": ["10990757393173962230"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01140671.2010.482965", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9t2hGJ4Dh5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 5}}
