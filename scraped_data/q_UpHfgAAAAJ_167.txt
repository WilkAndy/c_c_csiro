Crop data include main developmental stages, leaf area index (LAI), above ground biomass, grain yield and grain number of 72 soybean cultivars in China. We derived the parameters controlling soybean \ufb02owering and maturity time in the lack of data from contrasting environments, then tested APSIM to simulate LAI, biomass and grain yield. Our results show that once phenology is correctly simulated, APSIM was able to capture the LAI and biomass growth dynamics of multiple cultivars and across different years. Our data showed a strong correlation of grain yield with grain number, but not with grain size. Future model improvement could include the simulation of grain setting (grain number and grain filling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:K4-iKlO5MD4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4733435681390016339", "cites_id": ["4733435681390016339"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030119300772", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UzdpZKyKsEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
