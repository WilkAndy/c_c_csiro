We developed and tested a general inverse approach to estimate PAWC from crop yield.The APSIM model was used to simulate wheat yield on synthetic soils with contrasting PAWC and climates. The simulated results were used to develop an empirical model to relate simulated yield to PAWC. The empirical model was inversely used to predict PAWC from observed crop yield. Potential prediction ability was quantified using independently simulated wheat yield on actual soils. The actual ability was assessed with measured wheat yields and PAWC.The approach had higher accuracy for sites with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:4QKQTXcH0q8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9869735789819196060", "cites_id": ["9869735789819196060"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-020-04757-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nPIho2hY-IgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
