The importance of modelling the function of plant roots in water and nutrient uptake from the soil is becoming increasing clear with the expanding application areas of crop models. This paper reviews the approaches and assumptions used in growth and uptake modelling of plant roots, and how the responses of plant root system to internal and external factors are captured in the widely used crop models. Most modelling approaches are based on one of the following assumptions: (i) that plant roots are uniformly distributed in homogenous soil layers and all roots have the same ability for uptake, or (ii) that plant root length is always sufficient for resource uptake in rooted soil layers. In structured soils, an overestimation of water uptake is likely \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7520544804006073958", "cites_id": ["7520544804006073958"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR03201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZhYxWKdXXmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 15, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 13, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
