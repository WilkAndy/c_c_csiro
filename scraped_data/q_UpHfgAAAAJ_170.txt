Area of fully expanded individual leaves of maize hybrids released before 1995 (defined as old hybrids) has been simulated using a bell-shaped function (BSF) and the relationship between its parameters and total leaf number (TLNO). However, modern high-yielding maize hybrids show different canopy architectures. The function parameters calibrated for old hybrids will not accurately represent modern hybrids. In this study, we evaluated these functions using a dataset including old and modern hybrids that have been widely planted in China in recent years. Maximum individual leaf area (Y0) and corresponding leaf position (X0) were not predicted well by TLNO (R2\u202f=\u202f0.56 and R2\u202f=\u202f0.70) for modern hybrids. Using recalibrated shape parameters a and b with values of Y0 and X0 for modern hybrids, the BSF accurately predicted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:EBV337fEn3EC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18411663128002014752", "cites_id": ["18411663128002014752"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214514118300576", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IK631BBeg_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
