However, the model's performance in terms of predicting N2O emissions was mainly assessed against total emissions per growing season or year, which may reduce accuracy in modelling due to the uncertainties in total emissions estimated using the manual (static) chamber method.Here, a comparison between optimizations for Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with total N2O emissions and daily N2O emissions was conducted. We further used the validated model to develop simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years and target potential opportunities to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining the grain yield under long-term climatic conditions.Five parameters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:GiYFt9mpioMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5954932931398464833", "cites_id": ["5954932931398464833"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X21002304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QfVHVfMrpFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
