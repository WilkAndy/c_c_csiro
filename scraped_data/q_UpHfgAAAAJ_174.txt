Fundamental to this is the incorporation of an understanding of social, economic and biophysical processes and, most importantly, their interactions. Reports such as the Bruntlandt Report, the Sustainable Regional Development Report (1999) by Greening Australia, the Industry Commission\u2019s A Full Repairing Lease (1999) and the National Action Plan\u2019s (NAP) for Salinity and Water Quality own strategic plan from 2001 all point to the same conclusion: sustainability requires a leap forward in effective use of environmental knowledge and knowhow to integrate all the drivers of change.The key focus for this project will be to develop and apply systems and techniques to enable regional communities to explore and test alternative \u201cfuture scenarios\u201d. The project will use scenarios to focus on the possible landscapes that might meet the long term NRM targets, such as those typically articulated in regional catchment strategies (or their equivalents). That is, if these NRM targets were met, what would the region look like with respect to the natural, economic and social environments? Designing the processes and systems to do this is a key objective of this project. This entails drawing together the stakeholders, linking into the full range of knowledge, experience and expertise, and also drawing in interpretive skills (through modelling). If successful, it will set a new standard in bringing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8345629180682503900", "cites_id": ["8345629180682503900"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=95a8686cbcf5be03aeafad7b51bae55c84c84906", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Aa31YWh0XMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
