Hence, a parasite module was developed within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and parameterised for simulation of development and growth of Orobanche crenata. Faba bean was chosen as a host crop to study the impact of O. crenata infestation on its growth and yield formation. In the model, we assume that O. crenata acts simply as an additional sink for assimilates and does not influence the host crop metabolism. The parasite carbon demand is calculated from the total number of parasite attachments and the potential growth rate of an individual O. crenata. The amount of dry matter partitioned into O. crenata is simulated based on the carbon demand and carbon availability of the host crop by assuming that O. crenata has a sink priority higher than vegetative faba bean organs, but lower than the grain bearing pods.Simulations were run with the new parasite module and the modified APSIM-Faba bean module against experimental data from Tel Hadya in northwest Syria. The results indicated that APSIM-Faba bean module was able to simulate the faba bean biomass growth and yield formation. The parasite module, together with APSIM-Faba bean, was capable of predicting the biomass accumulation of O. crenata and the yield loss of infected faba bean plants for various infestation levels and faba bean sowing dates, as well as under different water supply conditions. Such a model can assist in the development of a systems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8453938155639369187", "cites_id": ["8453938155639369187"], "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2003/c/18/manschadi.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:420BMPZrUnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
