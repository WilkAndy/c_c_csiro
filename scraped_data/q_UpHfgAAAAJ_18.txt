A significant decline in radiation and rainfall was detected during the 43 years, while both temperature and FDR exhibit an increasing trend in both wheat and maize seasons. The average trend of each climatic variable for each crop season from the four sites is that radiation decreased by 13.2 and 6.2 MJ m\u22122 a\u22121, precipitation decreased by 0.1 and 1.8 mm a\u22121, minimum temperature increased by 0.05 and 0.02\u00b0C a\u22121, maximum temperature increased by 0.03 and 0.01 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16897145006781384664", "cites_id": ["16897145006781384664"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9690-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2Ed419u3fuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 23, "2015": 10, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 13, "2020": 14, "2021": 7, "2022": 21, "2023": 5}}
