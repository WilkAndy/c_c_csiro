Quantification of such variations helps to better understand the changes in soil texture and subsoil constraints to inform spatially explicit management practice. An inverse modelling approach to estimate PAWC from crop yields was developed as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional soil sampling methods. In this study, we further extend this approach to predict and map in-field variations of PAWC from yield maps of single and multiple crops. Soil PAWC maps were produced based on inversely predicted PAWC using crop yield maps together with in-field management information, and compared with: 1) available water capacity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:htyGaKyDgHMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16074497682717944957", "cites_id": ["16074497682717944957"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122002658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fSw-4XkWFN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
