However, measured soil profile data quantifying the physical soil parameters that determine PAWC are limited. Choosing a \u2018representative\u2019 soil profile in order to parameterise a deterministic model is often subjective and may not be appropriate, leading to biased conclusions. To help support these deterministic crop modelling studies, we analysed soil profile data in Australia available in the APSoil database; a database of field and laboratory measured physical soil properties used to parameterise the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Specifically, we developed typical soil pattern profiles utilizing wheat for CLL using statistical shape analysis and cluster analysis.
