Here we show that the potential number of monthly ergot events differs strongly from year to year in accordance with ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation)-related climate variability. The analysis is based on long-term weather records from 50 locations throughout the sorghum-growing areas of Australia and predicts the potential number of monthly ergot events based on phases of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). For a given location, we found a significant difference in the number of potential ergot events based on SOI phases in the preceding month, with a consistently positive SOI phase providing the greatest risk for the occurrence of ergot for most months and locations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7727462579367239674", "cites_id": ["7727462579367239674"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR02198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-t9OKkZ2PWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
