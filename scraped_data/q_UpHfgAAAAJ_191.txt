However, a key challenge facing China's potato production is to realize a tradeoff between economic return and environmental impact. Effective strategies for reducing carbon emission without compromising potato yield remain to be developed. This study conducted a comprehensive assessment by integrating climate, soil, crop, and agricultural input data, crop model and life cycle impact assessment model to quantify potato yields, GHG emission amounts and intensities (GHGI), and economic benefits under the conventional planting pattern (CPP), the lowest GHG emission pattern (LEP), and the highest yield pattern (HYP) across China's potato planting regions including four sub-regions, i.e., North Single planting region (NS), Central Double \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:HqhvjgTjE9cC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15358553331676184441", "cites_id": ["15358553331676184441"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722051129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eX9zzuGKJNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
