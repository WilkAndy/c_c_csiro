A sensitivity analysis was conducted with a combination of five levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, seven temperature changes, five precipitation changes, together with five nitrogen application rates. Our results were in several aspects different from those of previous model inter-comparison studies for wheat, maize, rice, and potato crops. A partial model calibration only on phenology led to very poor simulation of aboveground biomass and seed yield of canola, even from the ensemble median or mean. A full calibration with additional data of leaf area index, biomass, and yield from one treatment at each site reduced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:u0Mu_IsstPMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1766474747391796688", "cites_id": ["1766474747391796688"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-022-03375-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0GX8bmzHgxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
