However, parameter estimation of FSP models remains challenging. We therefore used pattern-oriented modelling (POM) to test whether parameterization of FSP models can be made more efficient, systematic and powerful. With POM, a set of weak patterns is used to determine uncertain parameter values, instead of measuring them in experiments or observations, which often is infeasible.We used an existing FSP model of avocado (Persea americana \u2018Hass\u2019) and tested whether POM parameterization would converge to an existing manual parameterization. The model was run for 10 000 parameter sets and model outputs were compared with verification patterns.
