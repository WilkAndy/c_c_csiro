The APSIM-\u2010Wheat model (Wang et al. 2003) simulates growth and development of wheat crops in response to environmental and management conditions. In the current version of APSIM-\u2010Wheat (v7. 4), wheat temperature responses are simulated as linear increases or decreases between defined cardinal (base, optimum, maximum) temperatures for each process, including:1) Thermal time and phenology\u2013 The optimum temperature for development is 26 oC; development rate(or thermal time) decreases linearly to zero at temperatures of 0 and 34 oC(Fig 1a). Daily thermal time (DTT) is calculated using 3-\u2010hourly temperatures estimated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6393141386450901770", "cites_id": ["6393141386450901770"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ehsan-Rezaei-5/publication/260045275_Temperature_routines_in_SIMPLACE/links/0a85e52f3513e269e1000000/Temperature-routines-in-SIMPLACE.pdf#page=38", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ChtB-jcAuVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
