Two different approaches were applied for model calibration. The first approach, ie, general parameterisation, used all the data before the forecast year to calibrate the model, leading to one set of parameters. The second approach, called conditional parameterisation, only used data from the target forecast month/season prior to the forecast year for model calibration, leading to 12 sets of parameters, each for a given month/season. In addition, bias correction based on ARMA approach was applied to the streamflow forecasts. The conditional parameterisation approach improved model performance in both calibration and verification period, and more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3855264199944910745", "cites_id": ["3855264199944910745"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116132&sb=RECENT&n=28&rpp=50&page=48&tr=4064&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mTf_IF2mgDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
