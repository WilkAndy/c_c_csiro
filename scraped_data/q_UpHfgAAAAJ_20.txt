IRSs of spring and winter wheat Triticum aestivum yields were constructed from a 26-member ensemble of process-based crop simulation models for sites in Finland, Germany and Spain across a latitudinal transect. The sensitivity of modelled yield to systematic increments of changes in temperature (-2 to+ 9 C) and precipitation (-50 to+ 50%) was tested by modifying values of baseline (1981 to 2010) daily weather, with CO 2 concentration fixed at 360 ppm. The IRS approach offers an effective method of portraying model behaviour under changing climate as well as advantages for analysing, comparing and presenting results from multi-model ensemble simulations. Though individual model behaviour occasionally departed markedly from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1911692929381278451", "cites_id": ["1911692929381278451"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v65/p87-105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:86JlN5eyhxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 18, "2018": 21, "2019": 25, "2020": 21, "2021": 16, "2022": 20, "2023": 8}}
