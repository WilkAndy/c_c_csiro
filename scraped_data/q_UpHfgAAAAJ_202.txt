A first edition of an industry guide for wheat variety maturity was recently developed for use across Australia, representing a significant step forward for the grains industry. The aim of this paper was to revise and extend this industry guide to make it more robust, agronomically functional and meaningful to industry. The Australian Cereal Phenology Classification (ACPC) presented herein was developed using an unprecedented phenological data set with a diverse array of genotypes, environments and management. Field experiments were carried out with 70 wheat and 30 barley cultivars at 15 sites across Australia between 2017 and 2020. Thermal time to anthesis data were used to rank \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ufKn5pxu7C0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17662914866741185013", "cites_id": ["17662914866741185013"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030122002805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9QkTOn1HH_UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
