We further analyzed the key drivers of national soybean production and explored a potential solution to increase national soybean production with maize-soybean strip intercropping system based on data from 32 locations in the past 10 years.The results showed that the contrasting climate conditions across regions in China resulted in diverse maturity types of soybean cultivars, ranging from MG000 to MG\u2167 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:wkm4DBaukwsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12131437337307263315", "cites_id": ["12131437337307263315"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429022003422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UzEcsfuFW6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
