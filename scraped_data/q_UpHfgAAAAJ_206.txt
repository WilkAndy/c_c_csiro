Conference Proceedings", "pages": "955-958", "publisher": "Australian Society of Agronomy Inc", "abstract": "Fertiliser management in dryland cropping involves a trade-off between risk and return. Increasing the fertiliser application rate can increase profit in good years, but may lead to a loss in bad years. Farmers try to avoid the potentially serious consequences of consecutive loss years by adopting a conservative strategy, typically applying $1 of fertiliser only when the long-term net return would be $2. A forecast of seasonal rainfall can help inform fertiliser management decisions; application rates can be increased in forecast good years and decreased in forecast bad years. The value of a seasonal forecast of above/below median rainfall was determined at a variety of sites in the Australian wheat belt. The long-term value of the forecast varied from $16/ha to $80/ha, compared to a realistic conservative strategy without a forecast. This value was achieved with little increased risk. The same value could be obtained by increasing fertiliser rates in every year, but the risk was higher. Seasonal forecasts give probabilistic information about the seasonal bias and are therefore valuable in the long-run rather than in any given year. At the sites studied, and at an 80% level of surety, seasonal forecast information was of value over time periods ranging from three to eight years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:A8cqit5AE6sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8304907747518890411", "cites_id": ["8304907747518890411"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2015_Conference/pdf/agronomy2015final00233.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q8FAV5j1QHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
