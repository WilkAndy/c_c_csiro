The impact of alternative land use options including continuous cropping, rotations, perennial lucerne and forestry were simulated using historical weather data. With annual crops, the valley floor land units were predicted to receive 187 mm/year of extra water in addition to annual rainfall in one year out of 10, and in excess of 94 mm/year in one year in four. In this valley floor position predicted drainage averages around 110 mm/year under annual crops and pastures whereas permanent tree cover or perennial lucerne reduces drainage by up to 99%. Introducing lucerne into a crop rotation reduces drainage by 11%, 67% and 35% on the uphill, slope and valley units respectively. Planting trees on a specific land unit has little impact on the quantities of water predicted to run on to lower units as surface or shallow sub-surface flow. The more significant hydrological impact is on reduction in deep drainage on the units where trees are planted. The work indicates opportunities for the use of lucerne or trees in specific locations where positive hydrological benefits are disproportionately large given the areas taken out of crop production."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3440748517054747356", "cites_id": ["3440748517054747356"], "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2004/poster/1/6/1163_wange.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3BKA4Iv-vy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
