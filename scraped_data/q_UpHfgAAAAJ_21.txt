The extensive use of groundwater for irrigation agriculture under variable climatic conditions has resulted in the rapid decline of the groundwater table especially in areas north of the Yellow River, leading to hydrological imbalance and unsustainable agricultural production. This article analyses the sustainable level of vegetation/crop water use under the NCP climate by mimicking the evapotranspiration of a natural forest ecosystem. Such a system would have a mean annual evapotranspiration ranging from 470 mm/year in the northern to 910 mm/year in the southern part of the plain, leading to a mean annual water excess (rainfall minus evapotranspiration) ranging from 21 to 124 mm/year. The natural forest ecosystem would use less water than the current wheat/maize double cropping system. To mimic the water use of the natural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1593310418158029244", "cites_id": ["1593310418158029244"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.1677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vAk9M2KTHBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 9, "2011": 6, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 14, "2015": 15, "2016": 9, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 14, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
