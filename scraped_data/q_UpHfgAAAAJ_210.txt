Development scales currently in use are ambiguous, subjective and qualitative, they do not describe all stages in a crop\u2019s lifecycle, they do not explicitly distinguish between culm-level and crop-level development, and they are incompatible with modern analytical and computational technologies. Here we propose two new scales of wheat and barley development: the Single Culm Development Scale (SCDS) to define progression through the lifecycle of an individual culm, and the Population of Culms Development Scale (PCDS) to identify the timing of stages and duration of phases within a crop canopy. These development scales merge and fill gaps within existing scales currently in use, describe \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ZysSsiWj_g4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8015728441128784666", "cites_id": ["8015728441128784666"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030123000928", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
