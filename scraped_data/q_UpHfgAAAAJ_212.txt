Here, we embed ML algorithms into a process-based crop model. ML is used within GLAM-Parti for daily predictions of radiation use efficiency, the rate of change of harvest index and the days to anthesis and maturity. The GLAM-Parti-ML framework exhibited high skill for wheat growth and development in a wide range of temperature, solar radiation and atmospheric humidity conditions, including various levels of heat stress. The model exhibited less than 20 % error in simulating the above-ground biomass, grain yield and the days to anthesis and maturity of three wheat cultivars in six countries (USA, Mexico, Egypt, India, the Sudan and Bangladesh).
