However, P behaviour and dynamics in Vertosols are still not well understood especially within complex cropping systems. To complement our knowledge in P dynamics in Vertosols and collect critical information as a baseline for future agricultural model development, nine Vertosols were incubated with various P fertilizer treatments. Phosphorus dynamics were modelled in relation to physical and chemical properties. Results indicate that physical and chemical properties and P dynamics of the Vertosols are highly variable and differ substantially from the other soil types. This suggests that inclusion of selected soil properties to current soil P models could help to improve the understanding of the fate of applied P in Vertosols. This will be critical for future development of sustainable P fertilizer management strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:B2rIPIGFPLEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15523039511499018188", "cites_id": ["15523039511499018188"], "pub_url": "http://era.daf.qld.gov.au/id/eprint/8690/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zI9A7TDqbNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
