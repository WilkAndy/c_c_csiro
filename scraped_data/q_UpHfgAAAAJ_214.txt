A total of 64 wheat and 32 barley genotypes, selected for their diverse phenology, are being genotyped and phenotyped under different controlled conditions to parameterise the model. The same genotypes are also being grown and phenotyped at five field sites (two \u00d7 WA, SA, NSW, VIC) across eight times of sowing to validate the model. The initiative will deliver a web-based tool through the National Variety Trials (NVT) website where growers and advisors can plan cultivar \u00d7 time of sowing decisions for their specific environments. This will become available in 2022, with new cultivars being added as they are released."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:zzCxg_vo7cAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6893204717630306747", "cites_id": ["6893204717630306747"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/83412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u7lmPiuVqV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
