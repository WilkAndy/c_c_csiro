Low resolution simulation need less effort, but important details could be lost through data aggregation effects (DAEs). This paper aims to provide a general method to assess the DAEs on weather data and the simulation of cropping systems, and further investigate how the DAEs vary with changing crop models, crops, variables and production systems. A 30-year continuous cropping system was simulated for winter wheat and silage maize and potential, water-limited and water-nitrogen-limited production situations. Climate data of 1 km resolution and aggregations to resolutions of 10 to 100 km was used as input for the simulations. The data aggregation narrowed the variation of weather data and DAEs increased with increasingly coarser spatial resolution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:uAPFzskPt0AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17902707065863141469", "cites_id": ["17902707065863141469"], "pub_url": "https://ojs.macsur.eu/index.php/Reports/article/view/CP3-51", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XfilSjkxc_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
