Here, we used the APSIM farming systems model in combination with measurement data to test two hypotheses for tillage impact on SOC dynamics: 1) tillage increases decomposition rate of SOC and 2) tillage exposes protected SOC to decomposers. Adopting either of the two hypotheses, APSIM was able to simulate the SOC dynamics under four tillage intensities in a field experiment at Biloela. Otherwise, APSIM overestimated SOC under three intensive tillage treatments. However, without explicit understanding of mechanisms of SOC stabilization, it is difficult to judge the relative importance of the two hypotheses. Scenario analysis suggested that the two hypotheses had distinct effects on simulated long-term SOC dynamics, particularly under non-fertilization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:eAUscmXIlQ8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18094469190796413188", "cites_id": ["18094469190796413188"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Michael/publication/352362280_2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings/links/60c5a2bd92851ca6f8e57720/2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings.pdf#page=604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BImrRNx3HPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
