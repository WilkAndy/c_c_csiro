We propose to identify year patterns of climate impact on yield on the basis of rain and non\u2010rain weather. There are inter\u2010related impacts of climatic factors on crop production within a specific pattern. Historical wheat yield data in Queensland during 1889\u20132004 were used. The influence of meteorological conditions on wheat yields was derived from statistical yield data which were detrended by 9\u2010year\u2010smoothing averages to remove the effects of technological improvements on wheat yields over time. Climate affects crop growth and development differently over different growth stages. Therefore, we considered the climate effects at both vegetative and reproductive stages (before and after flowering date, respectively) on yield.
