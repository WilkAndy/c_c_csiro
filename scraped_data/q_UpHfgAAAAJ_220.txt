Effective landholder participation keeps the research focussed on practical, implementable solutions to real problems or opportunities. The landholders engaged in the process gain a better understanding of the research, and learn how to evaluate and apply the results. They are able to influence the research and gain more ownership of the research process. In participative research, learnings come from evaluating and recognising mistakes made and also recognising what elements of an approach were successful. Generating and sharing a written history of our approach to participative research and the mistakes and successes in this project will enable people not directly involved in the project to learn from the experience. That is the intent of documenting the project'Journey'from this' Catchment Response to Farm Scale Land Use Change'(Simmons Creek) research project. The project ran from January 2005 to February 2009. This description of the project journey is designed to be read in conjunction with the detailed technical report available at: http://www. csiro. au/files/files/psy9. pdf"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:wuD5JclIwkYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4767976147376120663", "cites_id": ["4767976147376120663"], "pub_url": "https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/catchment-response-to-farm-scale-land-use-change-the-journey-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V6PjUQtBK0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
