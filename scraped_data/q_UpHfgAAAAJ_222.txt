It has been developed using the generic crop module template with most of the model parameters externalised into a crop parameter file. This new design allows easy manipulation of parameter (trait) values in the parameter file and objective comparison of scientific hypothesis at component level. The new version of APSIM-sunflower is easy to update and maintain. It can serve as a powerful tool for performance evaluation of different cultivars under variable climate and choice of most suitable cultivars for certain region. It allows investigation of issues such as potential production regions, the impact of climate variability and change on sunflower production and the evaluation of environmental variability in plant breeding trials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Vztgr1qGG8IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11223397358235441750", "cites_id": ["11223397358235441750"], "pub_url": "http://www.australianoilseeds.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/4939/APSIM_sunflower.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vlqu5m6EwZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
