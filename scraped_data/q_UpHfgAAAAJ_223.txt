Principles are developed, based on which system data structures are defined and process functions constructed. Program architecture and function prototypes for simulating plant and field microclimatic processes are also described. The implemented structured functions and modular programs enable the exchangement of alternative submodels, function formulations and data among different models"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15962962338098739973", "cites_id": ["15962962338098739973"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DE94R0478", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BXtQzavVh90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1}}
