The response of SOC, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic income to different straw management methods in intensive wheat\u2010maize double cropping systems still need systematical study. An 8\u2010year field experiment was conducted in the Huang\u2010Huai\u2010Hai Plain to investigate the impacts of optimal straw management (wheat straw was all crushed and spread on the soil surface, maize straw was all crushed and returned t into 0\u201015 cm soil layer) and optimal straw management (wheat straw was all crushed and spread on the soil surface, while maize straw was all harvested for feed) on SOC sequestrations, carbon economy and economic income. The results showed that only returning wheat straw into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:v_xunPV0uK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ldr.4610", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zaqq_aC8J0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
