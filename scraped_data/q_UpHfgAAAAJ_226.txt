This mostly occurs via two pathways: (i) from the microbial mediated oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-), and (ii) denitrification [the reduction of NO3- to N2O and dinitrogen (N2)] in soil, although other processes and combinations exist. Most agro-ecological models (e.g., APSIM, DayCent, DNDC, FASSET, NOE and WNMM) explicitly deal with these two pathways albeit with different degrees of process understanding and empiricism. Models, which integrate the impact of multiple environmental factors on N2O emissions, in principle can provide estimates of N2O fluxes from complex agricultural systems. However, uncertainties in model predictions arise from differences in the algorithms, imperfect quantification of the nitrification and denitrification response to edaphic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ybfzIt2tCtgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR22009", "cites_per_year": {}}
