Applying more N fertilizer to wheat in the dry, cool winter season while less N to summer crops is expected to reduce the N2O emissions without scarifying yield, because summer crop (maize) will use the residual N fertilizer from the previous crop season (wheat) to maintain their productivity.We combined four years of experimental data and soil-plant system modeling to assess the productivity and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from various N fertilizer management strategies. The farming systems model APSIM was used to simulate the wheat-maize double cropping system with N fertilizer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:yZoBfgUKqwcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842902200332X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:es0lYPPAbmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
