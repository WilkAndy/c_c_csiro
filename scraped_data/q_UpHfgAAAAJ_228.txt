Together with scarce land and water resources, this poses a serious threat to food security. Field experiments have shown that relay intercropping systems under irrigated conditions can improve productivity. However, little is known whether these improvements could also be obtained with simultaneous intercropping in rain-fed agriculture under water-limited conditions. To investigate this question, we analyzed a maize/soybean simultaneous intercropping system, using a modeling approach. A light interception model for strip intercrops was implemented into the APSIM classic model for simulating crop growth and yield in strip-intercropped maize and soybean and then calibrated and validated using field experiments conducted from 2017 to 2019 at 4 sites in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:It0W0vAlS5QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-022-00839-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bN-_nb8gAv4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
