Although many crop models have been parameterised to predict wheat phenology, wheat breeding and agronomy research would benefit from robust models that quantitatively predict the interaction of genotype and environment based on known genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this study, the 90K SNP data of 55 wheat cultivars in the Australian Phenology Panel are integrating into wheat model in APSIM Next Generation (APSIM NG) to predict traits related with wheat phenology. Here we report the results for leaf appearance rate. The datasets collected from controlled environments and field experiments are used to calibrate and validate the wheat model in APSIM NG (APSIM-Release) and the new integrated genomic model (APSIM-GS) with different strategies. The model parameter values are estimated using global optimizations. Both APSIM-Release and APSIMNG could predict the leaf appearance rate for 55 cultivars with an acceptable level of accuracy?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:MGPUR4WVBMEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2022/CerealsAndCrops/ASAzheng_b_496s.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pUHQDQZTlN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
