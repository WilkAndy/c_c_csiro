The challenge for breeders is in identifying and selecting traits that are genetically correlated with environments into the future and/or difficult to manage away from their breeding nurseries. We report on studies targeting constitutively-expressed traits (eg. increased rates of spike and grain-filling and increased coleoptile length) to establish their value proposition for increasing grain yield in future environments. The work supports the potential for higher rates of grain-filling and longer coleoptiles as traits where genetics are available now in pre-emptive selection in breeding programs. Further, there is not expected to be any cost associated with these traits in grain yield or quality, or in cooler, wetter seasons."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:DIubQTN3OvUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2019/2019ASA_Rebetzke_Greg_124.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pSsqEtV3ojoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
