However, PAWC data at the required spatial resolution are not available because direct soil measurement is expensive and time-consuming. Here, we explore a new approach to inversely estimate PAWC from crop LAI time series using process-based modelling with APSIM together with machine learning. We used the APSIM model to simulate daily LAI of wheat in response to a wide range of PAWC across Australia. Vegetation metrics are derived from simulated LAI time series and were used together with climatic variables to build a machine learning model for predicting PAWC. The model explained 29% to 83% variation of PAWC across ten sites with contrasting climate. This implies a potentially more effective way of PAWC estimation, an alternative to direct soil sampling method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2019/2019ASA_He_Di_215.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:68-ZaWTK4BsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
