Well-tested cropping systems Models  that capture interactions between soil water and nutrient dynamics, crop growth, climate and  farmer management can assist in the evaluation of such new agricultural practices. One such cropping  systems model is the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). We evaluated APSIM\u2019s  ability to simulate the performance of cropping systems in Asia from several perspectives: crop phenology, production, water use, soil dynamics (water and organic carbon) and crop CO2 response, as well as its ability to simulate cropping sequences without reset of soil variables. The evaluation was conducted over a diverse range of environments (12 countries, numerous soils), crops and management practices throughout the region. APSIM\u2019s performance was statistically"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:pUxgyZctzPYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://krishi.icar.gov.in/jspui/handle/123456789/36833", "cites_per_year": {}}
