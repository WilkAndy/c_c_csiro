The management strategies have to be developed based on local soil and climatic conditions and for specific stakeholders' interests. In this study, we developed a framework to analyse optimal nitrogen (N) requirement for targeting different levels of crop yield and/or climate change mitigation. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) was applied at near-uniformly distributed multiple sites to simulate wheat yield in response to N applications, with the aggregated results tested against the national-level data in Australia. The calibrated model was applied to identify the optimal N management for different targets. Thereafter, correlation analysis was performed to quantify the relationships between N demand, yield and climate change mitigation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ShjGdcaqzI0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/6980431", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2f7KVhR3LK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
