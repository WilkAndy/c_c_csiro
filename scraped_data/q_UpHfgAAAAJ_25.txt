This paper investigated the changes in winter wheat phenology and analysed the impact of climatic, varietal and sowing date changes on crop phenology during the last three decades by combining field data with modeling. The APSIM crop model was used to quantify the changes in wheat phenology in terms of vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity as well as the changes in thermal time of pre- and post-flowering stage among wheat varieties at six sites in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that APSIM model could capture the phenological changes of winter wheat caused by interannual climatic change. There was a large spatial difference in the response pattern of wheat phenology to climatic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16011148375325084396", "cites_id": ["16011148375325084396"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429013000129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7ApT3Z0GM94J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 15, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
