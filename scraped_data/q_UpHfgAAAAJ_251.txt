Recent studies have indicated that chamber measurements tend to underestimate N2O emission. However, most models that simulate N2O emission are often calibrated against chamber measurements, which may lead to underestimation of N2O emission when the models are used as predictive tools. In this study, N2O emissions from a bare soil were measured using both static chambers and micrometeorological eddy covariance technique during a two months period (April\u2013June) at CSIRO\u2019s Ginninderra Agricultural Experimental Station, Canberra, Australia. In addition, soil temperature, moisture and soil mineral nitrogen contents (NH4 and NO3) in the soil profile were monitored frequently.
