Reversing the trend of SOC decline by storing more carbon in the soil in form of soil organic matter (SOM) has been considered as one way of carbon sequestration. However, SOC increase has to rely on increased carbon input from high level of biomass production, which requires matching nitrogen input to meed crop N demand. Furthermore, high SOM content in soil also enables more carbon dioxide (CO2) release though SOC decomposition and more soluble carbon and nitrogen (N) released for nitrifiers and denitrifiers through mineralisation, which resulting in the increase CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the system. In this study, we use the farming systems model APSIM to explore the SOC potentials under different N application rates and to estimate the N required for achieving the equilibrium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE02446296", "cites_per_year": {}}
