We were motivated to investigate the impacts of climate warming on the northern limits of maize planting. Additionally, we wanted to assess how spatial shifts in the cropping system impact the maize yields in NEC. To understand these impacts, we used the daily average air temperature data in 72 weather stations and regional experiment yield data from Jilin Province. Averaged across NEC, the annual air temperature increased by 0.38 \u00b0C per decade. The annual accumulated temperature above 10 \u00b0C (AAT10) followed a similar trend, increased 66 \u00b0C d per decade from 1961 to 2007, which caused a northward expansion of the northern limits of maize. The warming enabled early-maturing maize hybrids to be sown in the northern areas of Heilongjiang Province where it was not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4631009691698813023", "cites_id": ["4631009691698813023"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-012-0594-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X1gZScemREAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 12, "2016": 17, "2017": 9, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 16, "2023": 4}}
