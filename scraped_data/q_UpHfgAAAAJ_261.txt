Hydrological models (either lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models or physically based distributed models) can be used to simulate streamflows and update catchment conditions (eg soil moisture status) using rainfall records and other catchment data. However, in order to predict future streamflow using any hydrological model, rainfall forecast at relevant spatial and/or temporal scales is required. Together with downscaling, general circulation models (GCMs) are probably the only tools for making such seasonal predictions. POAMA (The Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia) is a state-of-the-art seasonal climate forecast system developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology based on a coupled ocean/atmosphere \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP113656&sb=RECENT&n=24&rpp=25&page=90&tr=4115&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pgaAJZ6lvMsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
