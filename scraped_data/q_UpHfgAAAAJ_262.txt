This paper demonstrates a modelling approach to estimation of carbon sequestration potential in agricultural soils. We used the APSIM farming systems model, together with soil profile data from 557 sites, to simulate the SOC sequestration potential for an annual wheat system. The point simulation results were used to develop a meta-model to estimate regional SOC potential across the wheat growing region. The results show that an annual winter cropping system has the potential to raise SOC if it could be managed properly. Alternative rotation systems (eg with pastures) may lead to higher SOC sequestration potential. However, building extra carbon in soil needs extra nitrogen input. Economically viable farming and management systems need to be developed to increase both SOC and farm profitability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:LWqeokA2EBkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Michael/publication/352362280_2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings/links/60c5a2bd92851ca6f8e57720/2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings.pdf#page=373", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FPTltgq5FzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
