Upscaling the results from those process-based models to assess the regional soil C change and sequestration potential is still a challenge due to the lack of detailed spatial information required. Meta-modelling could capture and summarize input-output relationships of systems models through simplified mathematical functions, and can significantly reduce the demand for input data required for initialization and parameterization of process-based models. Such a meta-model can be easily used for spatial assessment across regions. In this paper, we use the widely used Agricultural Production Systems sIMulater (APSIM) to generate simulation data, based on which we try to develop a simple meta-models for simulation of soil C changes across different regions in Australia. We run APSIM for 100 years (1907-2006) at 10 selected sites across the eastern Australia wheat-belt to generate soil C changes under a continuous wheat system. The 10 sites cover three annual rainfall patterns and a wide range of temperature and rainfall conditions, with mean annual rainfall in the wheat growth season ranging from 172 to 510 mm, and mean annual temperature ranging from 7.2 to 18.5oC. For each site, ten soils were used in the simulation to represent various soil types, with plant available water capacity (PAWC) ranging from 66 to 261 mm. The meta-models predict soil C content at the end of the 100-year simulation (Ccontent) and soil C changes from 1907 to 2006 (Cchange).Our simulation results indicated that both Ccontent and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46093486/A_meta-model_for_soil_carbon_stock_in_ag20160531-21547-2mk96w.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WmFRZCLYQ0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
