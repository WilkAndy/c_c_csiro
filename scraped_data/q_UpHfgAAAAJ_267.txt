In this paper, we synthesised data from 49 peer-reviewed papers to examine the effects of adopting CAPs on soil C dynamics in Australian agroecosystems. We also used the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to simulate changes in soil C under an annual wheat system as affected by nitrogen (N) application and stubble management across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). These results show that in Australian agro-ecosystems, cultivation led to C loss for more than 40 years, with a total loss of~ 50% in the surface 0.1 m of soil. Adoption of CAPs generally increased soil C. Increasing crop frequency and perennial crops, when combined with stubble retention, had the greatest impact on increasing soil C, but the long-term impacts remain unclear. The same CAPs can have different outcomes on soil C under different climate and soil combinations. Modelling results using APSIM show that under an annual wheat system, 100% stubble retention and optimal N supply would lead to a basin-wide average increase in soil C of 8 Mg ha\u20131 to a depth of 1.5 m in 100 years. Under such a system, the rates of soil C accumulation increases along a transect from northwest to southeast of MDB. Fertilization and stubble retention must be combined in order to achieve the full C sequestration potential of the system. A modeling approach, combined with measurements, is an effective way to estimate the spatial distribution of soil C sequestration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:h168fVGZblEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/1977.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jIlhsp62yEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
