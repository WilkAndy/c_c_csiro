Although this priming effect (PE) has been studied under various environmental conditions, the conclusions are inconsistent across space and time and the underlying mechanisms unclear. We used a meta-analysis with extensive datasets of CO 2 effluxes from soils with 13 C or 14 C labelled fresh C inputs and without fresh C inputs under various soil conditions to synthesize and assess the temporal dynamics of the PE. The results indicated that the PE declined in 20 days on average from 67\u2212 21+ 26%(95% confidence interval) immediately following the fresh C inputs to less than 7.6\u2212 1.8+ 2.0% and remained relatively stable thereafter. We also assessed the variability of the temporal dynamics of the PE in the collected datasets and the underlying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5290019847121109736", "cites_id": ["5290019847121109736"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071716301560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6IJr8gXtaUkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 20, "2020": 12, "2021": 17, "2022": 29, "2023": 15}}
