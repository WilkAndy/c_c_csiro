At inter-and intra-annual time scales, partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration, runoff, soil water storage and drainage is controlled by interactions between climate, soil and plant types. Spatial variation of soil properties with topography offers opportunity for different land use options and leads to temporal and spatial heterogeneity of plant or vegetation types, which, in turn, impact on overall catchment hydrology and system sustainability. This simulation study explores a bottom-up modelling approach to investigate the impact of spatial/temporal variability of soil and vegetation types on water balance at Simmons Creek catchment, NSW, Australia. The catchment covers an area of 178 km2 and was divided into sub-catchments; each of the sub-catchment was further divided into three land units from the top hill to valley floor corresponding to the Multi-Resolution Valley Bottom Flatness (MRVBF) topographic index. Each land unit may contain multiple soil types. The hydraulic properties of each soil type were derived by combining soil mapping and detailed profile measurement data. A farming system simulator was coupled with a catchment hydrological framework to enable analysis of different soil-plant combinations and climate variability as they impact on the catchment water balance. These land use options were arranged in different configurations down the topographic sequence of the three hydrologically interconnected slope units in each of the sub-catchments.
