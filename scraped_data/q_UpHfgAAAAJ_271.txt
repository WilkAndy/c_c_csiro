Although MDB and NCP are located in the southern and northern hemisphere respectively, they lie at similar latitudes (with slightly different longitudes), and both have temperate climate with similar annual rainfall range in most parts. The farming systems also have many similarities. However, they have different climate patterns and seasonality, which lead to distinct production and environmental problems. While the similarities facilitate easier research and technology transfer, the uniqueness of production and environmental problems in MDB and NCP offer new opportunities for enhanced collaborative research to improve systems sustainability. Both MDB and NCP are facing severe sustainability problems as a result of changed water balance by the agricultural production systems. In the southern MDB replacement of deep rooted perennial native vegetation with shallow rooted annual crops/pastures have significantly reduced plant water use and root zone soil water storage, which in turn has increased drainage beyond the plant root zone and ground water recharge, leading to rising groundwater table and dryland/river salinity. In contrast, in northern NCP, where intensified double cropping systems rely heavily on irrigation from groundwater. Irrigation, together with increased industrial and domestic water use, has led to over use of fresh groundwater, causing a severe decrease in groundwater resources.
