The five SOI phases were used for probabilistic forecasting of the frequency of such events. Results showed that the number of potential events varied strongly depending on time of the year and locations. For a given location, there were significant differences in the probability of exceeding the median number of potential monthly events between different SOI phases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2003/p/14/wang.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8chiInxRSnoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
