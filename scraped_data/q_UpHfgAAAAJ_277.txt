This has frequently led to misclassification, confusion and difficulties with making informed decisions regarding cultivar selection and time of sowing. In 2020, Australian Crop Breeders Pty Ltd published \u2018An industry guide for wheat variety maturity description\u2019(\u2018ACB Guide\u2019). The guide used relative heading dates of locally adapted cultivars planted at their target sowing dates to classify wheat varieties into nine spring and three winter classes. The ACB Guide represented an important step forward for the grains industry.As part of the GRDC National Phenology Initiative, the 2020 ACB Guide was revised and extended to make it more robust, agronomically functional and meaningful to industry. A new cultivar phenology classification scheme for wheat and barley\u2013the Australian Cereal Phenology Classification (ACPC)\u2013has now been published and is available to industry. The ACPC was derived and validated using a phenological data set with a diverse array of genotypes (70 wheat and 30 barley), environments"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:urP0JZOBBUsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://grdc.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0029/584147/Paper-Harris-Felicity-and-Corinne-Celestina-2023.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
