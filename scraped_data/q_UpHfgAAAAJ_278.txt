However, the performance of crop models for simulating crop root system has been rarely tested in many environments due to lack of detailed data caused by the difficulty to measure roots. In this paper, we present detailed measurement data on root biomass and distribution in 0-200cm deep soil profile at key developmental stages of wheat crop at Wuqiao in the North China Plain, and compare them with the root dynamics simulated by the agricultural systems model APSIM. The objectives are to test the model performance for modeling root biomass and distribution, and to investigate the potential impact of errors in root modeling on simulated yield responses under different levels of water and nitrogen supplies through changes in irrigation and nitrogen applications.The data were collected in two field experiments carried out in the 2003-04 (Exp 1) and 2008-09 (Exp 2) winter wheat growing seasons, each with three irrigation treatments and one fertilizer-N application rate of 158 kg/ha (urea N). Irrigation scheduling included: no irrigation (W0), one time of irrigation (750m3ha-1= 75 mm each time) at jointing stage (W1), two times of irrigation at jointing and flowering stages (W2), three times of irrigation at upstanding (double ridges), booting and start of grain filling stages (W3) and four times of irrigation at upstanding (double ridges), jointing, flowering and start of grain filling stages (W4), all as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ojlX30-wUrgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4898603673381825520&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8OtYRxZW-0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
