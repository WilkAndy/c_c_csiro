The crop growth model Soil\u2013Plant\u2013Atmosphere System Simulation (SPASS) was integrated in Expert-N and adapted for the simulation of potato growth. The aim of the study was to investigate the extent to which the SPASS model, tested thus far only for winter wheat, is suitable for the simulation of potato crops. In addition to re-parameterization of the model, minor modifications, such as description of phenological development, assimilate partitioning, nitrogen uptake and leaf senescence were carried out without changing the overall structure of the model. The SPASS model was calibrated using data from a potato field experiment carried out in 1996 at the Research Station Scheyern, which examined the effects of various fertilization applications on the growth and yield of two potato varieties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11656280720680018841", "cites_id": ["11656280720680018841"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706101001136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:meNdzo5tw6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 9}}
