However, due to the conceptual nature of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools in most models, they cannot be directly measured and can only be empirically initialized based on measured total SOC contents in the soil profile. It has been suggested that basing pools on measured SOC fractions may increase the confidence in SOM modeling as it would allow simulated dynamics to be compared to corresponding measurements (Smith et al. 2002, von L\u00fctzow et al. 2007). The objectives of this study were to:(i) examine the usefulness of SOC fractionation data for SOM modeling, and (2) investigate the potential impact of SOC pool change on simulated long-term dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Falconnier-Gatien/publication/262142008_Understanding_farm_trajectories_to_better_target_agricultural_technologies/links/0c960536bacc637f57000000/Understanding-farm-trajectories-to-better-target-agricultural-technologies.pdf#page=86", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-gTT4kNj6iIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
