However, the annual double cropping system of winter wheat and maize consumed a large amount of groundwater, has led to decline in groundwater table. For conservation of groundwater resource, deficit irrigation is promoted to reduce irrigation water use in recent years. This study combined process-based modeling and experimental data together to evaluate the effects of different irrigation strategies on crop production and groundwater table change for the past three decades in NCP. Data from a six year field trial (2006\u20132012) under four irrigation schedules and 28 year (1984\u20132012) field experiment under full irrigation was used to test the agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM) to simulate the responses of winter wheat and maize to different irrigation management. The results showed that APSIM model could well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3237935106865741990", "cites_id": ["3237935106865741990"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S116103011530006X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:psB_CtN07ywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 11, "2018": 15, "2019": 9, "2020": 21, "2021": 16, "2022": 20, "2023": 15}}
