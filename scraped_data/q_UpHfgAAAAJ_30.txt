Our primary focus is wheat; we consider forage crops, sorghum and legumes where relevant aspects of water\u2013nitrogen interactions have been advanced. From a physiological perspective, we ask: How does nitrogen deficit influence the water economy of the crop? How does water deficit influence the nitrogen economy of the crop? How do combined water and nitrogen deficit affect crop growth and yield? We emphasise synergies, and the nitrogen-driven trade-off between the efficiency in the use of water and nitrogen. The concept of nitrogen\u2013water co-limitation is discussed briefly. From agronomic and economic perspectives, the need to match supply of nitrogen and water is recognised, but this remains a challenge in dryland systems with uncertain rainfall.
