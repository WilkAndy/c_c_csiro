Data for ambient [CO2] and irrigated treatments were provided to the 21 models for calibrating plant traits, including weather, soil and management data as well as yield, grain number, above ground biomass, leaf area index, nitrogen concentration in biomass and grain, water use and soil water content. Models differed in their representation of carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration processes. The models reproduced the absence of yield response to elevated [CO2] under well-watered conditions, as well as the impact of water deficit at ambient [CO2], with 50% of models within a range of +/\u22121 Mg ha\u22121 around \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:vnF2_uLGgtgC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11943954892199907580", "cites_id": ["11943954892199907580"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030117300084", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_FDdUrFzwaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 20, "2019": 18, "2020": 27, "2021": 10, "2022": 19, "2023": 1}}
