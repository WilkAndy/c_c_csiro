A modeling approach is a useful tool to understand the interactions, especially over long climatic sequences. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to predict the long-term soil C dynamics under various agricultural practices at four semi-arid sites across the wheat-belt of eastern Australia. We further assessed the underlying factors that regulate soil C dynamics in the top 30cm of soil through scenario analysis using the validated model. The results show that APSIM is able to predict aboveground biomass production and soil C dynamics at the study sites. Scenario analyses indicate that nitrogen (N) fertilization combined with residue retention (SR) has the potential to significantly slow or reverse the loss of C from agricultural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=951832922709850387", "cites_id": ["951832922709850387"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311002048", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E3mkCwCXNQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 17, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
