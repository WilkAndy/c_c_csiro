We calibrated and evaluated the farming systems model APSIM with data from three sites (Luancheng, Yucheng and Fengqiu). The calibrated model was applied to simulate the response of crop yield to climate variation and irrigation. The results show that the APSIM model was able to simulate growth and yield of wheat and maize in a double cropping system. Root mean squared error (RMSE) of yield and biomass simulations were 0.83 and 1.40 t ha\u22121 for wheat, 1.07 and 1.70 t ha\u22121 for maize, respectively. Soil water and ET were also reasonably predicted, with RMSE of 24.33 mm 1.49 mm d\u22121, respectively. The simulated rainfed yield range was 0\u223c6.1 t ha\u22121 for wheat and 0\u223c9.7 t ha\u22121 for maize in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3142866513322305430", "cites_id": ["3142866513322305430"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronj2009.0505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lucLN3G0nSsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 14, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
