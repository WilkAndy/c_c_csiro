While previous studies showed that rice production in China has been and will be negatively impacted by global warming, the confounding effects of climatic change, variety improvement and agronomic managements have not been separately investigated. In this paper we combine an analysis of climate and rice growth data with crop modeling to investigate the impact of changes in climate, rice varieties, and agronomic management on rice productivity at four sites (Wuchang, Xinyang, Zhenjiang and Hanyuan) in China. The results showed a significant increase in minimum temperature during all rice growth stages at Wuchang and Zhenjiang, and from heading to maturity at Xinyang, but little change at Hanyuan. Global warming would have led to a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3708969897713153606", "cites_id": ["3708969897713153606"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911004348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RjbPk3joeDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
