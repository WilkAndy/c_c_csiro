Here we map global SOC turnover times (\u03c4) in the subsoil layer at 1\u2009km resolution using observational databases. Global mean \u03c4 is estimated to be  yr (mean with 95% confidence interval), and deserts and tundra show the shortest ( yr) and longest ( yr) \u03c4 respectively. Across the globe, mean \u03c4 ranges from 9 (the 5% quantile) to 6332 years (the 95% quantile). Temperature is the most important factor negatively affecting \u03c4, but the overall effect of climate (including temperature and precipitation) is secondary compared with the overall effect of assessed soil properties (e.g., soil texture and pH). The high-resolution mapping of \u03c4 and the quantification of its controls provide a benchmark for diagnosing subsoil SOC dynamics under climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:3MwzVuqRcA0C", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=921174633708806749", "cites_id": ["921174633708806749"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11597-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XWJQ4nKryAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 30, "2022": 28, "2023": 25}}
