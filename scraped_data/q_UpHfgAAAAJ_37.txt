We used data for two canola cultivars measured across up to six sowing dates, five plant densities and three years to investigate how different data impacted on the efficacy of calibration of the process-based APSIM-Canola simulation model. A Bayesian optimisation method was used to derive cultivar parameters. Our results showed that model calibration using data from a single or multiple similar seasons would likely result in significant equifinality (i.e. multiple combinations of parameters leading to similar simulation accuracy) and simulation uncertainty. The most effective calibration was to use data from contrasting environments (at least two seasons), particularly with in-season growth measurements.
