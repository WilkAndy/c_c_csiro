However, study results are inconsistent and varying from significant increase to significant decrease. It is unclear whether this variability is caused by environmental, or management factors or by sampling errors and analysis methodology. Using meta-analysis, we assessed the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to conversion of management practice from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT) based on global data from 69 paired-experiments, where soil sampling extended deeper than 40cm. We found that cultivation of natural soils for more than 5 years, on average, resulted in soil C loss of more than 20tha\u22121, with no significant difference between CT and NT. Conversion from CT to NT changed distribution of C in the soil profile significantly, but did not increase the total SOC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 716, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=901248707384290773", "cites_id": ["901248707384290773"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880910002094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1a3roezggQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 26, "2013": 30, "2014": 44, "2015": 35, "2016": 42, "2017": 56, "2018": 66, "2019": 61, "2020": 99, "2021": 101, "2022": 94, "2023": 43}}
