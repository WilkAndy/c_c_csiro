Using an agricultural systems model (the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator), we conducted a high spatial resolution and long\u2010term (122 years) simulation study to identify the key management practices and environmental variables influencing SOC dynamics in a continuous wheat cropping system in Australia's 96 million ha cereal\u2010growing regions. Agricultural practices included five nitrogen application rates (0\u2013200 kg N ha\u22121 in 50 kg N ha\u22121 increments), five residue removal rates (0\u2013100% in 25% increments), and five residue incorporation rates (0\u2013100% in 25% increments). We found that the change in SOC during the 122 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1170805378650573621", "cites_id": ["1170805378650573621"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12145", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NYuV50mJPxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 12, "2015": 14, "2016": 15, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
