Specific processes considered include crop development, growth rate, grain yield, water use efficiency, evapotranspiration, runoff and deep drainage. Individual impacts of changes in temperature, rainfall and CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and the combined impacts of these three variables were analysed for 2050 ([CO2] = 570 ppm, T +2.3\u00b0C, P \u22127%) and 2070 ([CO2] = 720 ppm, T +3.8\u00b0C, P \u221210%) conditions. Two different rainfall change scenarios (changes in rainfall intensity or rainfall frequency) were used to modify historical rainfall data. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to simulate the growth and water balance processes for a 117 year period of baseline, 2050 and 2070 climatic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2235749861812140770", "cites_id": ["2235749861812140770"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9599-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4vrwX6f6Bh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
