However, computing capacity remains a barrier to large-scale, high-resolution agricultural modeling. To model wheat production, soil carbon, and nitrogen dynamics in Australia's cropping regions at a high resolution, we developed a hybrid computing approach combining parallel processing and grid computing. The hybrid approach distributes tasks across a heterogeneous grid computing pool and fully utilizes all the resources of computers within the pool. We simulated 325 management scenarios (nitrogen application rates and stubble management) at a daily time step over 122 years, for 12,707 climate\u2013soil zones using the Windows-based Agricultural Production Systems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14166635304192209687", "cites_id": ["14166635304192209687"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815212002277", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F3PiSMD_mcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
