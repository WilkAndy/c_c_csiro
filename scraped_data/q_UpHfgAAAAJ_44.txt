In this study, we assessed the potential benefits, costs, and trade\u2010offs associated with biofuels agriculture to inform bioenergy policy. We assessed different climate change and carbon subsidy scenarios in an 11.9\u2003million ha (5.48\u2003million ha arable) region in southern Australia. We modeled the spatial distribution of agricultural production, full life\u2010cycle net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and net energy, and economic profitability for both food agriculture (wheat, legumes, sheep rotation) and biofuels agriculture (wheat, canola rotation for ethanol/biodiesel production). The costs, benefits, and trade\u2010offs associated with biofuels agriculture varied geographically, with climate change, and with the level of carbon subsidy.
