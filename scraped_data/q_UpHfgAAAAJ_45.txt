Here we combine simulation modeling and long-term maize yield records (1981\u20132009) from 10 sites to investigate the changes in maize yield potential, actual yield and yield gaps in the past three decades in the North China Plain (NCP). The cultivar parameters in the APSIM-maize model were derived based on the recorded flowering and maturity dates at each site, and the simulation results of calibrated model was able to explain >63% of the variations in recorded maize grain yield across the 10 sites. Potential maize yield simulated under sufficient water and nitrogen supply showed a general declining trend, significantly (P < 0.01) at half of the study sites. This was mainly caused by the declining radiation together with increasing temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7631500009795041649", "cites_id": ["7631500009795041649"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819231400121X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cTk5U9OI6GkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 18, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
