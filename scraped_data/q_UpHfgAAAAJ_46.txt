Developers of the various models were invited to compare model performance using a common data set. The data set consisted of wheat and Lolium rigidum grown in monoculture and mixtures under dryland and irrigated conditions. Results from four crop\u2003:\u2003weed competition models are presented: almanac, apsim, cropsim and intercom. For all models, deviations between observed and predicted values for monoculture wheat were only slightly lower than for wheat grown in competition with L. rigidum, even though the workshop participants had access to monoculture data while parameterizing models. Much of the error in simulating competition outcome was associated with difficulties in accurately simulating growth of individual species. Relatively simple competition algorithms were capable of accounting for the majority of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16303641344895427971", "cites_id": ["16303641344895427971"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3180.2003.00323.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gyXdO2wrQuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
