Fifteen years of experimental data on dynamics of N, P and K in soil, crop yield and nutrient uptake from nine fertilisation treatments at Zhengzhou, North China Plain, were used to analyse the contribution of different fertilisation treatments to crop yield, nutrient use efficiency and accumulation of nutrients in soil. The results showed that both N and P were limiting factors for crop growth. Without additional N and P fertilisation, only a very low yield level (ca 2 t ha\u22121 for wheat and 3 t ha\u22121 for maize) could be maintained. To achieve the potential productivity (i.e. yield level free of water and nutrient stresses) of wheat (6.9 t ha\u22121) and maize (8.3 t ha\u22121), wheat would need, on average, 170 kg N ha\u22121, 32 kg P ha\u22121 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5706220313051535958", "cites_id": ["5706220313051535958"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-009-9276-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VhqOUSSRME8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
