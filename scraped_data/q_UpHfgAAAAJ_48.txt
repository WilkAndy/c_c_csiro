While these models are a simplification of the reality, they allow a first assessment of the complexity of climate change impact in agriculture. They are playing an increasingly important role in assisting agriculture to adapt to climate change. This includes the use of modeling to optimize management practices, assist in breeding programs, develop new crop rotations and maximize the value of seasonal climate forecasts. In order to meet the increasing demand for assessment of climate change impact, crop models need to be further improved and tested with climate change scenarios involving various changes in ambient temperature and CO2 concentration.
