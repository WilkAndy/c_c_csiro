Impacts of individual changes in temperature, rainfall or CO2 concentration as, well as the 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios, were analysed. Along an E\u2013W transect, wheat yield at western sites (warmer and drier) was simulated to be more sensitive to temperature increase than that at eastern sites; along the S\u2013N transect, wheat yield at northern warmer sites was simulated to be more sensitive to temperature increase, within 1\u20133\u00b0C temperature increase. Along the E\u2013W and S\u2013N transects, wheat at drier sites would benefit more from elevated [CO2] than at wetter sites, but more sensitive to the decline in rainfall. The increase in temperature only did not have much impact on water balance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8713772930795692821", "cites_id": ["8713772930795692821"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-010-0343-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FeN9IVCK7XgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 4}}
