Cultivation of natural ecosystems has led to marked decline in soil C storage, such that conservation agricultural practices (CAPs) are widely recommended as options to increase soil C storage, thereby mitigating climate change. In this review, we summarise soil C change as a result of cultivation worldwide and in Australia. We then combine the available data to examine the effects of adopting CAPs on soil C dynamics in Australian agro-ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future research priorities related to soil C dynamics. The available data show that in Australian agro-ecosystems, cultivation has led to C loss for more than 40years, with a total C loss of approximately 51% in the surface 0.1m of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 455, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5316573019801312061", "cites_id": ["5316573019801312061"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706109004170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PduuO_5CyEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 7, "2011": 16, "2012": 16, "2013": 31, "2014": 35, "2015": 35, "2016": 42, "2017": 46, "2018": 36, "2019": 39, "2020": 44, "2021": 43, "2022": 46, "2023": 15}}
