Evaluation of the APSIM-Wheat model in terms of different cultivars, management regimes and environmental conditions. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 937\u2013949. Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world, and wheat models have been widely used to study yield responses to changes in management and climate. However, less information is available on how a wheat model performs in simulation of wheat response to changes in varieties, sowing dates and planting densities across space. This study presents an evaluation of the APSIM-Wheat model using data from field experiments consisting of three sowing dates, two and three crop varieties and three planting densities in a split-split plot design at three ecological sites from 2008 to 2010 in the North China Plain. The results show that the APSIM-Wheat model could capture a large part of the variation in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4345727650201962304", "cites_id": ["4345727650201962304"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.4141/cjps2011-266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QIfh8EUgTzwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 13, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
