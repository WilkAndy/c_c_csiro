An 11-year field experiment (2003\u20132013) with the same maize cultivar and two short-term experiments including different sowing dates and plant densities were conducted at Luancheng Agro-ecological Experimental Station in the North China Plain (NCP). The measured pheonological development, biomass and grain yield were used to calibrate and validate the APSIM-maize model. The results showed that APSIM-maize model could capture the biomass and grain yield of summer maize under the various management practices and weather conditions. After calibration and validation, five scenarios were simulated using the APSIM model. The simulated results showed that weather factors including sunshine hours and the diurnal temperature range during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4792428008534439792", "cites_id": ["4792428008534439792"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429016301526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cPdT5OEfgkIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 8, "2023": 9}}
