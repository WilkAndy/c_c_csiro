Data required to calculate the mean VPD on a daily basis are rarely available, and most models use approximations to estimate it. In APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), VPD is estimated from daily maximum and minimum temperatures with the assumption that the minimum temperature equals dew point, and there is little change in vapour pressure or dew point during any one day. The accuracy of such VPD estimations was assessed using data collected every 15 min near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia. Actual vapour pressure of the air ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 kPa. For more than 75% of the time its variation was less than 20%, and the maximum variation was up to 50%. Daytime mean VPD ranged from 0 to 5.3 kPa. Daily minimum temperature was found to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15701270658747592344", "cites_id": ["15701270658747592344"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR03216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mO7pqHke5tkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
