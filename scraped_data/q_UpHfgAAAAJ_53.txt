Previous studies found large uncertainty in simulated crop yields, especially beyond optimal temperature range. In this paper, we combined the data reported in literature and our controlled-temperature experiment to derive the temperature response functions of phenological development and biomass growth of maize crop based on the Wang-Engel function (Agricultural systems, 58(1): 1\u201324), and compared them with those adopted in two mostly used maize growth models APSIM-Maize and CERES-Maize. Our results support the previous findings that leaf elongation, leaf appearance and the rate of development towards flowering have the same temperature response. Our results indicate that a curvilinear response with cardinal temperatures of 5\u202f\u00b0C (base), 30\u202f\u00b0C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:i_7YvbSbtFEC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=962748495821696125", "cites_id": ["962748495821696125"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318300054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fWx-9adeXA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 17, "2022": 16, "2023": 4}}
