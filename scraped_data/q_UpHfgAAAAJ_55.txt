Here, we used an ensemble of 26 process-based wheat models applied at sites across a European transect to compare their sensitivity to changes in temperature (\u22122 to +9\u00b0C) and precipitation (\u221250 to +50%). Model results were analysed by plotting them as impact response surfaces (IRSs), classifying the IRS patterns of individual model simulations, describing these classes and analysing factors that may explain the major differences in model responses.The model ensemble was used to simulate yields of winter and spring wheat at four sites in Finland, Germany and Spain. Results were plotted as IRSs that show changes in yields relative to the baseline with respect to temperature and precipitation. IRSs of 30-year means and selected extreme years were classified using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4352158844036607617", "cites_id": ["4352158844036607617"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X1630498X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gW7g8Gj5ZTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
