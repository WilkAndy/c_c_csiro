Using 13 process-based crop models and the ensemble mean, we simulated 30 yr continuous cropping systems for 2 crops (winter wheat and silage maize) under 3 production conditions for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The DAE was evaluated for 5 weather data resolutions (ie 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 km) for 3 response variables including yield, growing season evapotranspiration, and water use efficiency. Five metrics, viz. the spatial bias (\u0394), average absolute deviation (AAD), relative AAD, root mean squared error (RMSE), and relative RMSE, were used to evaluate the DAE on both the input weather data and simulated results. For weather data, we found that data aggregation narrowed the spatial variability but widened the \u0394, especially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2687067376389272109", "cites_id": ["2687067376389272109"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v65/p141-157", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LTI5yYphSiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
