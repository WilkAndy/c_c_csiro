A highly modular structure has been developed for crop growth simulation models based on the essential processes that are common to various plant species. This generic process-oriented modular structure was implemented in the SPASS (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere System Simulation) model using Microsoft Visual C/C++ under Windows. SPASS is composed of six parts: (i) data management, (ii) memory allocation/initialization, (iii) Modules for crop, soil and microclimate processes, (iv) model configuration and simulation, (v) graphic/table display and (vi) model knowledge integration. The model can be easily configured using the Windows interface by choosing various combinations of process modules developed based on different model approaches. Up to 30 graphic and 5 table MDI (Multiple Document Interface) child windows can be opened during or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7018418508067239148", "cites_id": ["7018418508067239148"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481529900033X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7PRfqnJuZmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
