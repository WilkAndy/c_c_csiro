Although the North China Plain (NCP) is the most important agricultural production region in China, the impact of ENSO events on local climate and crop production has received only limited attention. Therefore, the impact of different phases of ENSO on local climate and production of winter wheat and summer maize, both rain fed and irrigated, was investigated at three sites using the agricultural production systems simulator model. Data on daily temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours for 50 years (1956\u20132006) were analysed to build climate scenarios for three categories of ENSO: years with El Ni\u00f1o events, years with La Ni\u00f1a events, and neutral years. The pattern of climate change was generally similar across the three sites: annual precipitation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11781342006538025074", "cites_id": ["11781342006538025074"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-013-0455-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cjgWfSK8f6MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
