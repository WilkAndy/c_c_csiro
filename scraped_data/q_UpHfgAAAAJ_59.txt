However, there have been no studies to quantify the impacts of sowing time and climate variability. Experimental data to analyse the response of canola growth to sowing date are limited to a few seasons; however, combining these data with modelling provides an efficient means to study the impact of sowing date and historical climate variation. The APSIM-Canola model was calibrated and tested using data from three field experimental sites in the Yangtze River Basin. These experiments included different cultivars and sowing dates, and recorded major phenological stages, biomass, and grain yield. After calibration of the phenological parameters and maximum harvest index, the model was able to simulate the onset of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2119289358251560537", "cites_id": ["2119289358251560537"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/cp11332", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WY7ZXnE6aR0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
