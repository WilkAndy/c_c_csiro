While its productivity has been constantly increased, the sustainability of the double cropping system has been increasingly questioned due to the high resource use and negative environmental impact. This paper combined field data with scenario modelling to investigate the productivity, resource (water and nitrogen) use efficiency and environmental impact of the wheat\u2013maize rotation in response to management changes at a representative site Wuqiao in NCP. In addition the potential options to increase the system\u2019s eco-efficiency, i.e., producing more with less input and less negative impact on the environment were explored. The results show that 180 kg/ha/year of nitrogen could be considered as the optimal N rate for summer maize.
