In this study, we reported the changes of climatic conditions, soil nutrients, variety types and management practices in the Taihu region (a typical rice growing zone) of east China in two periods (the 1980s and the 2000s), and simulated the changes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields under different scenarios by using the APSIM-Oryza model. The contributions of the influencing factors in rice growing system were also calculated. The results revealed that there was a warming trend in the rice growing period in the Taihu region. However, the precipitation and sunshine hours in the rice growing season showed a decreasing trend in the past 30 years. Compared with the soil nutrients in the 1980s, the mean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11744385998859178106", "cites_id": ["11744385998859178106"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429013001470", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:epASb9dw_KIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
