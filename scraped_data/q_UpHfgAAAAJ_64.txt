Optimal planting date and supplemental irrigation time for potato differed greatly with climate and soil conditions, and were not fully investigated via field experiments. In this study, using APSIM-Potato model carefully calibrated and validated with two-years serial planting experimental data, the individual and coupled impacts of planting date and supplemental irrigation time on yield and water productivity (PWP) of potato were quantified across the APE. APSIM-Potato performed well in simulating phenology, leaf area index (LAI), soil water dynamics, biomass of potato, and also captured the trend in potato yields under different planting dates. Based on the long-term simulations from 1981 to 2010, the optimal planting dates were May \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9433477626179345381", "cites_id": ["9433477626179345381"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030118301138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5dsDmetx6oIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 19, "2022": 13, "2023": 11}}
