Few studies have explored the possible difference between the calculated and observed solar radiation data, and how this difference transfers to differences in simulated crop yield. This paper compared observed global solar radiation and calculated values using the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m\u2013Prescott (AP) model and the Johnson\u2013Woodward (JW) model at different time scales. We further used the farming systems model APSIM to investigate the difference in simulated wheat and maize yields caused by the use of observed and calculated solar radiations at eight sites in the North China Plain (NCP). The results revealed significant differences between the observed and calculated solar radiations, which also varied among sites. Overall, the calculated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9017772432826269606", "cites_id": ["9017772432826269606"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429015000568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pn_r2z-QJX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 10}}
