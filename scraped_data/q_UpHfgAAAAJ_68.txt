Ncc has been derived with two contrasting approaches: one against above ground biomass (Ncc-biomass), and one against developmental stages (Ncc-stage). While the former has been claimed in diagnostic use, both approaches are adopted in wheat simulation models. This paper provides data from North China Plain (NCP) to re-exam the Ncc-stage relationships used in two widely used wheat models (APSIM and CERES) and to compare the Ncc-biomass vs. Ncc-stage relationships. The results revealed significant higher maximum and critical N concentrations in leaves of wheat in NCP than the values used in the APSIM-wheat model. Recalibration of the APSIM model with the new N concentrations led to improved simulations for wheat biomass and N uptake, particularly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=970848359512086637", "cites_id": ["970848359512086637"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429014001300", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bRh9b3AleQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
