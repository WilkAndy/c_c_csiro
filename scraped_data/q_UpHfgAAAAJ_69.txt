The spatial distribution of productivity of agricultural crops and pasture, and biomass was modelled. Average annual economic returns were calculated under historical mean (baseline) climate and three climate change scenarios. Economically viable areas of biomass production were identified where the profitability of biomass is greater than the profitability of agriculture under each scenario for three factory gate biomass prices. The benefits of biomass production for dryland salinisation, wind erosion, and carbon emissions reduction through biomass-based renewable energy production were also modelled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9671507115092476967", "cites_id": ["9671507115092476967"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837709001379", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JwTAtXoYOIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
