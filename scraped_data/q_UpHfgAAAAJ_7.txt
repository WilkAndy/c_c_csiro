This model also includes the prediction of the development of leaves, internodes and tillers. It gives EC stage values, i.e. the decimal code defined by Zadoks, J. C., Chang T. T. and Konzak, C. F. (1974) Weed Research14, 415\u2013421, as outputs. The model was parameterized and tested using observation data from The Netherlands, north and south Germany. Simulation results show that the phenology model can be used to simulate development stages for different wheat varieties with acceptable accuracy. The model can be extended to other cereal crops."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 416, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17373637187053088340", "cites_id": ["17373637187053088340"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X98000286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VO7Q3viOG_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 14, "2008": 15, "2009": 13, "2010": 14, "2011": 15, "2012": 23, "2013": 27, "2014": 20, "2015": 19, "2016": 18, "2017": 35, "2018": 28, "2019": 28, "2020": 41, "2021": 26, "2022": 32, "2023": 16}}
