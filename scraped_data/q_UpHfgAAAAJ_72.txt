Meta\u2010modeling can be used to simplify and summarize process\u2010based models and significantly reduce the demand for input data and thus could be easily applied on regional scales. We used the pre\u2010validated Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the impact of climate, soil, and management on SOC at 613 reference sites across Australia's cereal\u2010growing regions under a continuous wheat system. We then developed a simple meta\u2010model to link the APSIM\u2010modeled SOC change to primary drivers, i.e., the amount of recalcitrant SOC, plant available water capacity of soil, soil pH, and solar radiation, temperature, and rainfall in the growing season.
