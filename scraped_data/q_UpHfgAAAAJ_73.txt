Various uncertainties however exist, not only in the model design and model parameters, but also and maybe even more important in soil, climate and management input data. We analyze the performance of the point-scale crop model APSIM and the global scale crop model LPJmL with different climate and soil conditions under different agricultural management in the low-input maize-growing areas of Burkina Faso, West Africa. We test the models' response to different levels of input information from little to detailed information on soil, climate (1961\u20132000) and agricultural management and compare the models' ability to represent the observed spatial (between locations) and temporal variability (between years) in crop yields. We found that the resolution of different soil, climate and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4592075168791121287", "cites_id": ["4592075168791121287"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/2/024017/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h82vQQlUuj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
