These modules have been developed based largely on the existing model theories and can be used generally to simulate the dynamic processes in different soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere systems. They are exchangeable and are programmed in the form of C functions and stored in a Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The simulation results for three winter wheat varieties in the Netherlands, North and South Germany show that the parameterised model can simulate biomass growth, water uptake, and nitrogen uptake of wheat crop reasonably well if no extreme conditions or damage (by pest and disease) occur. The soil water contents and the contents of mineral nitrogen were also predicted with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3756491010719344489", "cites_id": ["3756491010719344489"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815202000063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aeff56u8ITQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
