However, the yield\u2013precipitation relationship depends on the distribution and amount of precipitation over the crop growth period. Understanding crop yield responses to precipitation can help develop appropriate measures to ensure stable crop production in the agro-pastoral ecotone. In this study, an experiment was conducted consisting of five planting dates each year across four years and three planting dates in one year, to investigate the potato yield response to precipitation at a representative site (Wuchuan) in the ecotone. The optimal planting date, with the highest potato yield, varied substantially in different years during the experimental period. It was found that potato yield had the highest correlation with the ratio of precipitation to potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:oursBaop5wYC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9983865579631270172", "cites_id": ["9983865579631270172"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318301059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HNkrD9nQjYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
