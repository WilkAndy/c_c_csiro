The impact varies with environmental conditions and crop management practices and needs to be considered when harvesting the residue for bioenergy productions. Here, we defined the sustainable harvest limits as the maximum rates that do not diminish SOC and quantified sustainable harvest limits for wheat residue across Australia's agricultural lands. We divided the study area into 9432 climate\u2010soil (CS) units and simulated the dynamics of SOC in a continuous wheat cropping system over 122 years (1889 \u2013 2010) using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). We simulated management practices including six fertilization rates (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 kg N ha\u22121) and five residue harvest rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7369193960251834938", "cites_id": ["7369193960251834938"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcbb.12145", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OsLD-dyiRGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
