We use wheat as a target crop and the APSIM farming systems model  as an example to analyse the current status of process-based crop models with a major focus on need to improve simulation of specific eco-physiological processes and their linkage to underlying genetic controls. For challenging production environments in Australia, we examine the potential opportunities to capture physiological traits, and to integrate genetic and molecular approaches for future model development and applications. Model improvement will require both reducing the uncertainty in simulating key physiological processes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:8uzoZH4hB9AC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5312384356508948531", "cites_id": ["5312384356508948531"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/70/9/2389/5380476", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M9gOEG1huUkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
