This paper presents a study on how the plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) of soil interacts with rainfall variability and nitrogen input level to determine wheat yield, water use and the potential value of seasonal forecasting in nitrogen (N) management in southeast Australia. An agricultural production systems model was used to simulate those interactions. Results show that optimising N management towards maximum economic return led to increased production risk. Wheat yield, gross margin and crop water use increased, while deep drainage decreased with increasing soil PAWC. In high rainfall areas where the risk of crop loss was generally small, increased soil PAWC reduced the variability in gross margin, leading to higher yield, less water loss by deep drainage, and reduced potential value of seasonal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1707826366902268757", "cites_id": ["1707826366902268757"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192308001998", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VXNBQQhrsxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
