The results showed that the average errors of the simulations of leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and soil moisture content in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 field experiments were 27.61%, 24.59% and 7.68%, and 32.65%, 35.95% and 10.26%, respectively, and those of LAI and biomass on the soils with high and low moisture content in 2002-2003 were 26.65% and 14.52%, and 23.91% and 27.93%, respectively. The simulations of LAI and biomass accorded well with the measured values, with the coefficients of determination being> 0.85 in 1999-2000 and 2002-2003, and 0.78 in 2000-2001, indicating that APSIM had a good applicability in modeling the crop biomass and soil moisture content in the continuous cropping system, but the simulation error of LAI was a little larger."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2115205010387027835", "cites_id": ["2115205010387027835"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/18260451", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e8c-B8C3Wh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
