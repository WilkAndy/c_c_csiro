Crop production in the NCP is sensitive to changes in both climate and management practices. While previous studies showed a negative impact of climatic change on crop yield since 1980s, the confounding effects of climatic and agronomic factors have not been separately investigated. This paper used 25 years of crop data from three locations (Nanyang, Zhengzhou and Luancheng) across the NCP, together with daily weather data and crop modeling, to analyse the contribution of changes in climatic and agronomic factors to changes in grain yields of wheat and maize. The results showed that the changes in climate were not uniform across the NCP and during different crop growth stages. Warming mainly occurred during the vegetative (preflowering) growth stage of wheat and maize, while there was a cooling trend or no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 391, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14214878802486671822", "cites_id": ["14214878802486671822"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02077.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zrlyC_VkRcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 15, "2013": 24, "2014": 47, "2015": 48, "2016": 30, "2017": 37, "2018": 27, "2019": 33, "2020": 41, "2021": 35, "2022": 32, "2023": 14}}
