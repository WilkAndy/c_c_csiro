However, cultivar parameters are often estimated based on limited data and using a trial-and-error method, leading to uncertainties in simulated phenology and subsequent crop yield. In this paper we evaluated the ability of the APSIM-Canola model to simulate canola phenology and the impact of uncertainty in phenology modelling on simulated grain yield.We constrained the APSIM-Canola model to experimental data to derive the parameters controlling canola flowering and maturity dates using a Bayesian optimisation method, by minimising the RMSE between simulated and recorded pre- and post-flowering durations. The dataset covered observations for 10 cultivars, 35 site-years, with maximum of seven sowing dates each year from four canola growing regions in China.Our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:RtRctb2lSbAC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1325024356248082102", "cites_id": ["1325024356248082102"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192316303689", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tlbouKFuYxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
