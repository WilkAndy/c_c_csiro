Understanding the uncertainty in simulated crop phenology can help target future direction of model improvement and assess climate change impact more accurately. However, the uncertainty in maize phenology modelling across regions and under climate scenarios has not been properly addressed. This study investigated the uncertainty in simulated maize phenology using six widely used models (SIMCOY, MAIS, Beta, WOFOST, CERES, and APSIM). The models were firstly calibrated and validated using long-term observational data across China\u2019s Maize Belt. The validated models were then used to simulate maize phenology changes in response to climate change. The results showed that the six models could reach acceptable precision (NRMSE < 8% for all the six models) by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3032085859734936267", "cites_id": ["3032085859734936267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030115300204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y1r8VQYiFCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
