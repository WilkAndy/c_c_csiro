Due to the low recovery and residual effects of applied P, long-term measurements are required to quantify crop response to P inputs. A modelling approach enables integration of available data to investigate response of crops to P additions in different soils. The APSIM agricultural production systems model has an ability to simulate crop response to soil P. However, the model has only been tested against a few datasets for maize, sorghum and bean crops outside Australia. It has not been applied to Australian conditions, nor against other crops. In this paper we derived the model parameters for wheat, soybean and peanut based on literature and measurement data. The parameterised model was tested for simulation of biomass growth, grain yield, P uptake and grain P contents of four crops (wheat, maize \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1248191835067040328", "cites_id": ["1248191835067040328"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429013003213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SMK2XNx3UhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
