We applied the biogeochemical process model Biome-BGC to simulate the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) under the present and future climate conditions in mangrove forests in Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, and Qiongshan across the southern coast of China, and in three monocultural mangrove stands of two native species, Avicennia marina and Kandelia obovata, and one exotic species, Sonneratia apetala, in Shenzhen. The soil hydrological process of the model was modified by incorporating a soil water (SW) stress index to account for the impact of the effective SW availability in the coastal wetland. Our modified Biome-BGC well predicted the dynamics of NPP and LAI in the mangrove forests at the study sites. We found that the six mangrove systems differed in sensitivity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2997479463798171730", "cites_id": ["2997479463798171730"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-010-9365-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Uug35bAvmSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
