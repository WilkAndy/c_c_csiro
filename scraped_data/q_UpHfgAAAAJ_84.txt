As P fertilizer application rates increased from 88 to 123 kg P2O5 ha\u22121 yr\u22121 during 2004 to 2014, total P use efficiency (total P output in crops as a percentage of total P input) dropped from 68 to 20%, leading to an accumulation of >90 kg P2O5 ha\u22121 in the soil each year. Phosphorus lost from agriculture is the second greatest contributor to waterbody eutrophication in China, accounting for 25% of total P losses in 2010; the main contributor is livestock husbandry. Given these problems, as well as the finite nature of P reserves, three strategies are proposed here to reduce P fertilizer application rates, improve P use efficiency, and minimize the environmental risk caused by P loss in China: (i) improving soil legacy P utilization by modifying cropping systems, rhizosphere management, or microbial engineering \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:rFyVMFCKTwsC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1536896985904586620", "cites_id": ["1536896985904586620"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2019.02.0054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fB82daonVBUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 11, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
