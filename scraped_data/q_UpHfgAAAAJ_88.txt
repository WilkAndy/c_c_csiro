Similarly, crop production can be defined as the human activity that produces useful organic material in agriculture by means of crops, with the sun as energy source. A crop is some kind of collection of a specific plant that is grown regularly and in large quantities in the fields or in greenhouses. Crop production provides the primary materials for all other agricultural processes. A high and stable crop yield has been almost always the goal of crop production. In the developing countries, the level of human inputs is usually low. The goal of crop production may be to optimize the utilization of limited resources to get a stable yield. While in the developed countries, the high human inputs (especially chemical fertilizer, herbicide and pesticide) may lead to, besides the high crop yield, unnecessary costs and severe environmental pollution. In this situation, the goal of crop production should be both to get a high yield and not to pollute the environment. How can we optimize the utilization of natural resources and the application of human inputs to get a high and stable yield, to reduce the costs and without polluting the environment?These questions can only be answered when the relations between plant processes and the environment factors are able to be quantified. Although many processes in the crop production system are still not well-understood, mathematical equations, which relate essential plant processes to environmental factors, can be established and quantitative estimates can be made based on the current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3366923557946756672", "cites_id": ["3366923557946756672"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AkwpWWUqjtUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:QI5PISO3uS4J:scholar.google.com&ots=5I2NNnXKRB&sig=OaSLR1VSQaRw7qgAqhGe-TGbo0Q", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QI5PISO3uS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
