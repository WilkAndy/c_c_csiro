Experimental work conducted for a relatively short period (several years) to explore water-saving cropping systems at limited sites offers useful, but limited insights regarding future sustainable cropping systems in NCP to balance productivity and groundwater usage. An understanding of the performance of various alternative cropping systems under the long-term inter-annual climate variability across the precipitation gradient in NCP is needed, but yet lacking. Our study provides a systematic assessment on productivity and environmental impact of 5 alternative cropping systems along a precipitation gradient across NCP, through combination of cropping systems modelling and scenario analysis. Our results show that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14037305254729005543", "cites_id": ["14037305254729005543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192318301424", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:57nYn8GGzsIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
