This is particularly important for seasonal streamflow forecasting with the use of hydrological modelling. Considering the possible effects of hydrologic non\u2010stationarity, this paper examined ten parameterization schemes at 12 catchments located in three different climatic zones in east Australia. These schemes are grouped into four categories according to the period when the data are used for model calibration, i.e. calibration using data: (1) from a fixed period in the historical records; (2) from different lengths of historical records prior to prediction year; (3) from different climatic analogue years in the past; and (4) data from the individual months. Parameterization schemes were evaluated according to model efficiency in both the calibration and verification period. The results show that the calibration skill changes with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=765181343562983971", "cites_id": ["765181343562983971"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.8420", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I-rTu2B4ngoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
