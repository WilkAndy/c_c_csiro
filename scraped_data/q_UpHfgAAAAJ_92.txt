Increasing atmospheric CO2 can affect agricultural production both directly through the stimulation of photosynthesis, through improved water use efficiency and indirectly as the increased concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may induce climate change. Global change is used here to refer to the combined effect of changes in CO2 and climate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17537155228665690425", "cites_id": ["17537155228665690425"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arvind-Singh-21/post/How_does_climate_change_impact_crop_yield_in_Australia/attachment/5ad17e9fb53d2f63c3c5b741/AS%3A615167960289287%401523678879569/download/01-B+Wheat.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ObmAv8N9YPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
