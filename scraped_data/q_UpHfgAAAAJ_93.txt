Agricultural system management is a major component of natural resource management (NRM). Farming systems modelling has been successfully used to develop understanding of soil\u2013plant\u2013climate interactions and to assist on-farm decision-making processes. There is an increasing demand for applying farming systems models beyond point/field scales to support NRM planning and decision-making in spite of the limitations of such models. This paper presents two case studies in south-east Australia on modelling farming systems performance beyond point/field scales to support NRM planning. The first study focuses on the impact of spatially explicit crop/vegetation management on catchment hydrology to address dryland salinity. A one-dimensional farming systems model was directly coupled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2246233552014084493", "cites_id": ["2246233552014084493"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.njas.2009.07.002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jQldtoM5LB8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
