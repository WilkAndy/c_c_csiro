A farming system simulator was coupled with a catchment hydrological framework to enable analysis of climate variability and 11 different land\u2010use options as they impact the catchment water balance. These land\u2010use options were arranged in different configurations down a sequence of three hydrologically interconnected slope units (uphill, mid\u2010slope and valley floor land units) in a subcatchment of Simmons Creek, southern New South Wales, Australia. With annual crops, the valley floor land units were predicted to receive 187 mm year\u22121 of run\u2010on water in addition to annual rainfall in 1 in 10 years, and in excess of 94 mm year\u22121 in 1 in 4 years.
