In order to maximise N use efficiency (NUE), growers attempt to match N fertiliser to seasonal water limited yield potential, which in the southern grain growing region is largely determined by in-crop rainfall. Australia\u2019s variable rainfall makes water limited yield potential very difficult to predict, and growers tend to under fertilise, fearing economic and environmental losses of N if crops are over-fertilised. However, environmental losses of excess N are low in the semi-arid, winter dominant rainfall environments with high water holding capacity soils that comprise much of the wheat producing regions of south eastern Australia. This is particularly the case when high carbon (C) to N ratio crop residues are retained which facilitate rapid immobilisation of any mineral N surplus to crop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:cB__R-XWw9UC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1989151271936509492", "cites_id": ["1989151271936509492"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880919302609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NMZK-IrimhsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
