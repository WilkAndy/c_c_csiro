However, it is unclear about the credibility of model\u2010predicted C pool size, decay rate (k), and/or microbial C use efficiency (e) as only data on bulked total C is usually available for model constraining. Using observing system simulation experiments (OSSE), we constrained a two\u2010pool model using simulated data sets of total soil C dynamics under topical hypotheses on responses of soil C dynamics to warming and elevated CO2 (i.e., global change scenarios). The results indicated that the model predicted great uncertainties in C pool size, k, and e under all global change scenarios, resulting in the difficulty to correctly infer the presupposed \u201creal\u201d values of those parameters that are used to generate the simulated total soil C for constraining the model.
