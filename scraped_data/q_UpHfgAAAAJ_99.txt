It is essential to improve management strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental costs, while maintaining grain yields. However, there is a lack of studies to evaluate mitigation strategies under long-term climate variability. This paper combines field experimental data and soil\u2013plant systems modeling to investigate the potential for improving water and nitrogen management of a wheat\u2013maize double cropping system in North China Plain. The APSIM model was calibrated against the data and then applied to simulate crop yield and N2O emissions from soil in response to irrigation and nitrogen inputs. Our results show that the N fertilizer rate and irrigation amount under the local farmer practice could be reduced by 28% and 14% without \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "q_UpHfgAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8847526739911202238", "cites_id": ["8847526739911202238"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X16300476", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vlUtmbG6yHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
