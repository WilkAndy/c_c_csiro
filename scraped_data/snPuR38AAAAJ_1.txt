We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5\u00b0\u00d70.5\u00b0 latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 4659, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1979708569733911040", "cites_id": ["1979708569733911040"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94jd02950", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AFLJiXRWeRsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 30, "1997": 46, "1998": 61, "1999": 117, "2000": 120, "2001": 140, "2002": 137, "2003": 158, "2004": 138, "2005": 184, "2006": 186, "2007": 225, "2008": 227, "2009": 232, "2010": 226, "2011": 224, "2012": 240, "2013": 231, "2014": 198, "2015": 190, "2016": 198, "2017": 181, "2018": 187, "2019": 192, "2020": 171, "2021": 157, "2022": 139, "2023": 77}}
