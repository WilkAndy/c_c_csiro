They are becoming an increasingly prevalent delivery model. We have developed a cloud-based image analysis toolbox to provide a wide user base with easy access to the software tools we have developed over the last decade. The toolbox is provided as a service on an Australian national cloud infrastructure. The design and implementation of the cloud-based service are presented, including its architecture, key components and some image analysis and visualization examples showing the capabilities of the service for biomedical image analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7036529399673702682", "cites_id": ["7036529399673702682"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6546078/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GskkNzXGpmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2}}
