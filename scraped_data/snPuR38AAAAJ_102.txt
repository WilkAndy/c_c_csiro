This paper discusses our work on the design and implementation of the cloud-based image analysis and processing services on an Australian national cloud infrastructure, including their architecture, workflow management framework, image analysis and visualization examples, and the challenges we faced. Key components of the services are described, showing the capabilities of the service engine for real-world cloud-based biomedical image analysis applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5409844240902789114", "cites_id": ["5409844240902789114"], "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/cloud-based-services-for-biomedical-image-analysis", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-hc0raygE0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
