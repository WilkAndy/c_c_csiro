The purpose of the trial landform is to test, over the long term, proposed landform design and revegetation strategies for the site, such that the most appropriate one can be implemented at the completion of mineral processing. While SSD is leading the erosion assessment project, and providing most of the staff resources, there is also a substantial level of assistance and collaboration being provided by technical staff from ERA. SSD is also contributing to the revegetation component of the trial landform by work on vegetation analogue communities.The trial landform was designed to test two types of potential final cover materials for the rehabilitated mine landform: waste rock and waste rock blended with approximately 30% v/v of fine-grained weathered material (lateritic material). In addition to two different types of cover materials, two different planting methods were implemented: direct seeding and tube stock."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4425243918993343227", "cites_id": ["4425243918993343227"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/ssr203-part2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-0IO_OWfaT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
