To solve this problem, we have created a graphical user interface, called Espresso, that allows users to change these values without having to examine the code. This approach dramatically increases the usability of the model and speeds productivity. We have also modified Vis5D to run on tiled displays. Using such displays allows us to view our climate data at much higher resolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7234580715984696439", "cites_id": ["7234580715984696439"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46080-2_80", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d7Qoq9RkZmQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2}}
