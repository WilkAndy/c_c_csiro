The system has a streamlined Graphical User Interface for interaction with the cluster. Apart from extensive functionality related to X-ray CT in plane-wave and cone-beam forms, the software includes multiple functions for X-ray phase retrieval and simulation of phase-contrast imaging (propagation-based, analyzer crystal based and Talbot interferometry). Other features include several methods for image deconvolution, simulation of various phase-contrast microscopy modes (Zernike, Schlieren, Nomarski, dark-field, interferometry, etc.) and a large number of conventional image processing operations (such as FFT, algebraic and geometrical transformations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15239836077397869197", "cites_id": ["15239836077397869197"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8141/81410B/Toolbox-for-advanced-x-ray-image-processing/10.1117/12.893252.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jYJ7FCvGftMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 13, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 2}}
