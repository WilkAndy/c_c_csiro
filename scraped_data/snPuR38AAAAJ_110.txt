This paper illustrates the various procedures and methodologies adopted within the computer package. SAM is a useful tool for practitioners in selecting an appropriate probability distribution from a set of alternatives to represent statistical, environmental, socioeconomic, and engineering data. It also estimates the parameters of the distribution, predicts the desired percentile values, and calculates the minimum errors associated with the prediction. The package also provides extreme value, reliability and life-testing analyses that are essential in many scientific fields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14185323768411757470", "cites_id": ["14185323768411757470"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815298000140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:npsWcM9k3MQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
