The United Kingdom Medicines Inspectorate, however, carries out voluntary inspections, on request, on a fee-charging basis, and reports on good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance. The standards applied reflect those described in Annex 13 of the EC \u201cGuide to GMP\u201d and the inspection process closely follows that for a licensed manufacturer.Standards of GMP found in United Kingdom manufacturers of investigational products so far are generally acceptable, but some particular noncompliances are noted regularly. Of concern in a small number of cases is the lack of assurance of the control of cross-contamination. The United Kingdom would support, in principle, an EC move toward the licensing of the manufacture of clinical trials supplies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12733533974910780638", "cites_id": ["12733533974910780638"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/009286159402800411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3sTsXa-ZtrAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1}}
