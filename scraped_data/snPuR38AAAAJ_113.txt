A GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC TRACER TRANSPORT MODEL As a first step in the process of developing a global tropospheric chemistry and transport model we must develop a, high resolution transport model. A stochastic global 3-dimensional l. agrangian tracer transport model has recently been developed for the purpose of studying the sources and sinks of trace gases important to climatic change [31.
