Projections based on existing Australian design rules for motor vehiclesindicate that total NOx emissions will probably increase considerably over the next two decades. Complete certainty is of course not possible in such predictions, but it would seem a strong possibility that the increase will be sustained if no action is taken. A decision on the best level of control clearly requires careful choice of air quality standards so as to protect public health and welfare adequately and at the same time avoid imposing an unnecessary economic cost on the community. It is recommended that the monitoring of ambient NO2 levels be expanded, and the reporting of ambient concentrations improved to include frequencies of occurrence of both NO and NO2 levels. To overcome a major uncertainty associated with the analysis of long-term trends in total emissions of NOx, it is suggested that a useful data base for heavy-duty vehicle emission rates be established. There is a need also for additional and more reliable data on which to base economic assessments. Heavy-duty motor vehicles have been identified as a major source of emissions of NOx, and unlike motor cars their emissions presently remain uncontrolled. In addition the impact of NOx emissions may not be restricted to the major Australian cities and may also occur in regions where heavy-duty motor vehicle road use is high.(TRRL)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12229675412346828481", "cites_id": ["12229675412346828481"], "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/210935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wfZC7_2IuKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1}}
