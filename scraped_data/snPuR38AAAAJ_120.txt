With advances in computing technology and storage media, it is now feasible to generate multi-year simulations. The goal of the Project to Intercompare Regional Climate Simulations Experiment 1C (PIRCS-1 (c)) is to apply an intercomparison methodology to multi-year simulations, covering the period 1 July 1986 through 31 December 1994.(Any modeling group is welcome to submit simulations for analysis. See www. pircs. iastate. edu for details.) By doing so, PIRCS-1 (c) will facilitate analysis of the fidelity of interannual variability of regional climate simulations. Data analysis for PIRCS-1 (c) is in a very preliminary stage. At the conference, we will present results of an intercomparison of interannual variability of the North American Monsoon in RCM simulations. In what follows, we present analysis of a segment of PIRCS-1 (c) simulations that is valid during the time of the Midwest drought of 1988. Short simulations (60-day simulations) of this event were examined during PIRCS Experiment 1A (PIRCS-1 (a); Takle et al. 1999). This previous analysis serves as a benchmark for the multi-year simulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6788445634536442191", "cites_id": ["6788445634536442191"], "pub_url": "https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/71899.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T4mYf1ZnNV4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
