This shows how to assess the applicability of the approach to water quality problems. The analysis involves data on stream acidity from the Birkenes catchment in Norway. The modelling approach is hybrid in that it uses: (1) a deterministic or process-based description to simulate (non-stationary) long term trend values of environmental variables, and (2) probability distributions which are superimposed on the trend values to characterise the frequency of shorter term concentrations. This permits assessment of management strategies and of sensitivity to climate variables by adjusting the values of major forcing variables in the trend model. Knowledge of the variability about the trend is provided by: (a) identification of an appropriate parametric form of the probability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14739810875578727060", "cites_id": ["14739810875578727060"], "pub_url": "https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-abstract/24/6/25/27656", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lDpPf-VTjswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1}}
