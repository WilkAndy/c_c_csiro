Manufacturers\u2019 recommendations concerning storage temperatures should be observed and this may involve the use of specialised storage and transport facilities. Temperature-monitoring devices should be used to demonstrate compliance with the designated temperature ranges.The distribution chain is seldom simple and distribution systems can vary enormously. In its simplest form, the chain involves shipment direct from the manufacturer to the customer or end user. In its more complex form, the distribution chain may involve a number of storage and transit locations, including airports and docks, and a variety of transport facilities, including aircraft."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7598307677206148468", "cites_id": ["7598307677206148468"], "pub_url": "https://www.dacbvr.tw/sites/default/files/documents/Temperature-Monitoring-and-Transporting-Medicinal-Products.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dPX-KZOccmkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
