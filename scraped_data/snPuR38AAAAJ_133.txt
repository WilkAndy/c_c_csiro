All of them represent a meaningful way of presenting data to a scientist or researcher, support understanding of underlying phenomena, and also allow interaction with the data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nist.gov/publications/high-performance-visualization-science-and-research", "cites_per_year": {}}
