Complexities of structural characterisation are the key not only in understanding the resultant microstructures but also the mechanisms of their formation. There has been a steady advancement in theoretical and numerical modelling of material microstructures. Computable theoretical models are particularly successful in simulating the formation and structures of grains on fine length scales. Nevertheless, in most cases, comparisons between model predictions and experiments could only be made statistically. That is, the model-predicted micro-morphology structures would not be suitable for detailed comparisons with specific experimental samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP126779&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ybgYrIrgwlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
