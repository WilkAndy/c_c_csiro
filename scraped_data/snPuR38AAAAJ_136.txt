Furthermore, when incorporated into numerical weather prediction and regional climate modeling frameworks, these systems have been shown to influence convective precipitation, surface energy budgets and supporting boundary layer characteristics. They have also a non-linear impact on these key hydroclimatological metrics when their simulated overall spatial extent and density is progressively increased. We will present seasonal and multiyear regional climate simulations using satellite-derived prairie wetland extents corresponding to the 1990's Great Plains wetland flooding period (c. 1993-2000 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUSM.A33A..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
