Many researchers have studied selective wetting on planar substrates using patterned hydrophobic and hydrophilic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) 1, and grafting of polymer brushes. 2 Such surface has been demonstrated to control the assembly of nanoparticles. 3 Others use microwells4, 5 and nanochannels6 with variable sizes to guide crystal growth and confine the assembly of mesostructures within the channels, respectively. It will be desirable to dynamically tune the surface wetting behavior on a topographic surface by grafting stimuli-responsive polymer brushes, resulting in drastic switching surface from highly hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic. 7-11 However, it is yet to investigate the possibility of combining chemical and physical heterogeneities on a topographically structured surface, which may provide unprecedented control of molecular recognition and reorganization. Here, we demonstrate the dynamic tuning of surface wettability from highly hydrophobic to superhydrophilic by changing temperature from 40\u00baC to room temperature. Such smart surface was used to selectively trapping and repelling of nanoparticles at different locations of the nanopillar arrays.Epoxy nanopillar arrays (diameter of 1\u00b5m, height of 9 \u00b5m, and pitch of 2 \u00b5m) were used in our experiment as the topographic substrate. They were transfer-molded from the corresponding silicon master through poly (dimethylsiloxane) mold.
