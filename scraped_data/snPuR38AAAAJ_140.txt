These complex surface water systems, in turn, swell in surface area during wet cycles and contract (and in some cases completely disappear into the cropland/pastureland land cover matrix) during dry cycles. Since the early-to-mid 1990s, these wetland systems have expanded to their historical maximum. The resulting expansions have had an impact on surface hydrology, and agricultural practices (including new crop rotation regimes in the affected areas) and may impact regional climate feedbacks. To examine the potential for these feedbacks, we shall present results of regional climate simulations of the recent decadal period featuring comparisons of precipitation and evaporation patterns with the ambient land cover \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUSM.A41A..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
