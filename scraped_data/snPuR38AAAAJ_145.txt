Generally, models predict similar meridional variability of the zonal annual mean of surface atmospheric CO2 for the components due to air-sea fluxes and fossil emissions; conversely, models predict very different meridional structure for the third component, the baseline for air-land fluxes. For instance, the neutral biosphere boundary condition in the TRANSCOM-1 Intercomparison (12 models) generated large discrepancies: a high group of models simulated surface atmospheric CO2 that was 2-3 ppm higher on average at 60N than in the Southern hemisphere, a middle group found that that difference was 0 to 0.6 ppm, and a low group (1 model) predicted a negative difference,-1.5 ppm. These discrepancies imply anywhere from a large northern hemisphere carbon sink to no sink at all.
