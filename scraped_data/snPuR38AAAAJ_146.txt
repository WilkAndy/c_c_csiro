Tympanosclerosis, a pathological condition affecting the middle ear and tympanic membrane, is a frequent sequel to persistent OME and/or its treatment. The underlying mechanisms of this disease are still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the development and progression of tympanosclerosis in the pars tensa of rats using a new model for persistent OME (Russell & Giles, Laryngoscope 108, 1998). 56 male specific pathogen free CD Wistar rats underwent unilateral eustachian tube obstruction under general anaesthesia. The contralateral ear served as a control. Only rats with sterile effusions were studied. The pars tensa from rats with effusions ranging from 1 to 12 month was examined by light and electron microscopy.
