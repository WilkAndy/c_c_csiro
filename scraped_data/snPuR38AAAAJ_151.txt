The meeting provided an opportunity for open discussion by scientists with an interest in regional climate science and in downscaling global climate model output for use in climate impact assessment for the Midwest and Great Plains. More than forty experts in the fields of regional climate science and high-performance computing attended the meeting and undertook discussions in-five working groups. This document provides a record of those discussions; it is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of the field of regional climate science. Comments on the content of this document are welcome."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:31047199", "cites_per_year": {}}
