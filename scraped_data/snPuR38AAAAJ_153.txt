At the recent (at time of writing) Second Conference of Parties (COP2) to the Climate Convention this threeway split remerged over a central point of debate: the setting of greenhouse gas atmospheric stabilisation targets and the development of strategies to achieve them. In the heat and complexity of fundamentally ideological arguments, the science and policy of global warming often seemed divorced spheres. In response to this situation, we reflected on how our previous scientific work based on global carbon cycle modelling!(Taylor 1996; Wong and Taylor 1995) might better be integrated with political analysis to advance the latest round of debate. The resultant paper is not intended to be prescriptive of policy guidelines for individual nations. Instead, it is aimed at providing a perspective on how the current state of scientific knowledge may be used to inform key political questions related to the development of effective and equitable strategies for carbon dioxide emission abatement. Ensuring that a particular target is met effectivelyThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second Assessment Report (IPCC 1996) concluded that cumulative historic anthropogenic emissions have raised atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to a level which is having a\" \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10746059312655509555&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MygcggKsIZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
