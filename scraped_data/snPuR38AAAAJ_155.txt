The introduction of unleaded petrol and catalytic converter technology has contributed to the reduction of ambient lead levels and the concomitant reduction in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from motor vehicles. Despite these positive comments concerning the air quality of the ACT, a number of problems remain which require urgent research if they are to be adequately understood and sucessfully managed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.141818100261036", "cites_per_year": {}}
