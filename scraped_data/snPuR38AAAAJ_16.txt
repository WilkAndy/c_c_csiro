In this study, we conduct an investigation on the spatial and temporal changes in ET0 of the Haihe River Basin in present and future stages. The ET0 in the past five decades (1961\u20132010) are calculated by the Penman\u2013Monteith method with historical climatic variables in 40 sites while the ET0 estimation for the future period of 2011\u20132099 is based on the related climatic variables projected by Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) multimodel ensemble projections in Phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) using the Bayesian Model Average (BMA) approach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10724889560217784802", "cites_id": ["10724889560217784802"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818114000216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4pETbDt21pQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
