This workshop, sponsored jointly by the National Committees for the IGBP and Mathematics and the Centre forMathematical Analysis, was one in a series of workshops with the aim of providing in-formed guidance for Government policy makers to assist in deciding which IGBP related mathematical research activities should be supported over the next decade. These activities would constitute part of Australia's contribution to the IGBP research."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4283919393645557602&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
