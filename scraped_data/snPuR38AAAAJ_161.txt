There has recently been a shift in emphasis away from analysis of specific national problems that can be treated in a short time frame, and hence mostly with existing knowledge and data. Research is now directed towards the construction of decision support tools for long-term acquisition of fundamental information of general use to a common core of resource and environmental problems of national and global concern. At the same time flexibility has been retained to consider important topical problems as they arise on the public policy agenda; attention to these motivates the long-term research program and makes it more robust.The basic premise in the Centre's long-term research direction is that there are large gaps in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://projecteuclid.org/ebook/Download?urlid=pcma/1416323841&isFullBook=false", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OebXEWuUgFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
