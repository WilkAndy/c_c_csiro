In this paper, we will address this claim using a realworld sensor fault dataset provided by Airbus\u2013a problem of sensor health unsupervised classification. In the 2019 worldwide competition with this dataset hosted by Airbus, Fujitsu Systems Europe (FSE) won the first prize with an F1-score of 93 percent using a DL model based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Another comprehensive study compared the performance of various modified and the existing image encoding methods for the convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) model, where the best classification result was a F1-score of 91 percent using the scalogram as the image encoding method. We will use these two studies as the benchmark for us to compare with some basic statistical analysis methods and the oneclass supporting vector machine (SVM). The comparative study demonstrates that the DL-based techniques have great potential but they are not necessarily always superior to traditional methods. We recommend that where possible all future published studies of applying DL methods to MHM include appropriately selected traditional reference methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://humsconference.com.au/Papers2021/1_Diagnostics_and_Prognostics_1_3_Wang.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RmzayH37VEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
