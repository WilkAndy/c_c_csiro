The basic idea is to eliminate the local descriptors with lower frequencies among the selected video frames from a shot to ensure that the shot representation is compact and discriminative. Specifically, we propose an adaptive frame selection strategy called furthest point voronoi (FPV) to produce the shot frame set according to the shot content and frame distribution. We describe a novel strategy named reference extraction (RE) to extract the shot interest descriptors from a keyframe with the support of the selected frame set. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches with extensive experiments.
