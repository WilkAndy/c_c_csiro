However, the performance of fabricated sensors has not yet approached the theoretical limit one calculates assuming ideal behavior of the sensors\u2019 ferromagnetic layers\u2019 magnetizations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nve.com/docs/doc430c1073d0ade.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Kn095o4gAtcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
