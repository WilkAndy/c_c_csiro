It is the product of a set of first steps taken to address an critical challenge that now confronts modern science and which is produced by a convergence of three separate factors: 1) the compelling science case to be made, in both fields of deep intellectual interest and fields of vital importance to humanity, for increasing usable computing power by orders of magnitude as quickly as possible; 2) the clear and widely recognized inadequacy of the current high end software infrastructure, in all its component areas, for supporting this essential escalation; and 3) the near complete lack of planning and coordination in the global scientific software community in overcoming the formidable obstacles that stand in the way of replacing it. At the beginning of 2009, a large group of collaborators from this worldwide community initiated the International Exascale Software Project (IESP) to carry out the planning and the organization building necessary to begin to meet this critical problem."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=8158f4be45ca396c403ee72f5ed18635729e4443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gqs0FuY8zTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
