However, it has inherent issues such as when the material has fine structures far below the X-ray CT resolution, or non-uniqueness of attributing a particular intensity level to a material phase. To overcome limitations of single energy (spectrum) X-ray CT in resolving microstructures with sub-voxel fine structures, a data-constrained modelling (DCM) approach with multi-energy (spectrum) X-ray CT has been developed for the characterization of microscopic compositional distributions. DCM assumes that the total volume of a voxel is the sum of partial-volumes from its constituent materials. The model is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem with nonnegativity constraints, using multi-energy X-ray CT data as constraints. This DCM approach has been used in compositional microstructure characterization for a range of materials, such as mineral phase distribution in hydrocarbon reservoir rocks and corrosion inhibitor distribution in paint primers.DCM software has been developed for convenience of microstructure characterization. The software has built-in 3D visualization capabilities. We have also developed an API for adding plug-ins for 3D data processing and modelling. Figure 1 shows the main interface of the DCM software displaying the 3D microstructure of a calcite-dolomite rock. Figure 2 shows the colour coded clusters of pore connected structures in another rock sample."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Y-Yang-13/publication/268516302_Multi-energy_X-ray_CT_based_data-constrained_modelling_of_material_microstructure_and_properties/links/546e94b40cf29806ec2eb786/Multi-energy-X-ray-CT-based-data-constrained-modelling-of-material-microstructure-and-properties.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bE2PbBGLiEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
