In High-Content Analysis (HCA) hundreds to thousands of microscopy images are processed during automated experiments. The speed at which image processing is performed in these situations can greatly affect the overall workflow throughput. Here we report some early results on GPU acceleration of the Neurite Detection module in our groups\u2019 HCA-Vision1 software for highcontent analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nvidia.com/content/GTC/posters/2010/J01-Neurite-Detection-using-CUDA-GPU-Accelerated-Biological-Imaging-for-High-Content-Analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:68R5BGTJFrcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
