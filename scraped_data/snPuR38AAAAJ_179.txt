In one application dealing with anti-corrosive primers for metals, the distributions of corrosion inhibitor and filler particles in an epoxy matrix are major factors determining the degree of protection under corrosive conditions2. In another application in the field of geosciences, knowledge of the microscopic distributions of mineral phases in various rock formations is critical in the oil and gas industry3-4.While the value of knowing the distribution of materials composition within a sample is self-evident, the experimental techniques available for obtaining such structural information are generally costly and sample destructive. X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used as a non-destructive method to probe the internal structures of materials. However, X-ray CT only gives a microscopic map of the linear attenuation coefficient and is usually insufficient to determine compositional distributions within heterogeneous materials by the usual image rendering process5. The DCM approach has extended the reach of X-ray CT techniques to more directly determine material composition of a sample. By combining a generic model with sample-specific CT data taken under multiple X-ray beam conditions, DCM can provide microscopic details of compositional distributions in a wide range of samples6-9."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP102580&dsid=DS7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VVTDyqPQvEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
