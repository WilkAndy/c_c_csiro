An assessment of the methods by which goodness-of-fit may be evaluated is presented. A procedure for selecting amongst the exponential, gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions has been applied to 24-h average suspended particulates (\u03b2-scattering), ozone, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide observations recorded in Melbourne, Australia. It is shown that"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13976553192951659042", "cites_id": ["13976553192951659042"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698186901277", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ijo8-hOx9sEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 8, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
