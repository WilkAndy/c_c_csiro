In particular we need to account for the physical-geographic characteristics that play a significant role in the North American climate eg the Great Lakes, coastlines and mountain ranges, and also properly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15226580368443607478&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tokE1SuuT9MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
