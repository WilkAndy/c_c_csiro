In order to complete a simulation, many scripts must be edited and run. Often, the same variable and value must be set in different scripts. If a value is changed erroneously in the script, the run may fail or produce false results. This process wastes precious analysis and computational time. Also a great deal of effort must be devoted to studying the computer code in order to use MM5 to its fullest potential. Typically, it takes many months to learn the model before the scientist can do a simple simulation.These characteristics of MM5 are found in many model and simulation programs. With the \u201cGestalt of computers\u201d theory becoming more prevalent every day, people are demanding more userfriendly environments [4]. To this end, we have created a graphical user interface, called Espresso, that makes the task of running climate models more straightforward. With Espresso, the scientist no longer has to be proficient in computer science to perform a simulation, and the likelihood that the model will fail because of errors is greatly reduced. Espresso was also designed with flexibility that allows users to add and delete name list variables as well as load in completely different modeling systems. Planning Espresso, we considered an object-oriented design to be essential. With this in mind, we chose to write the program in Java. In addition, we incorporated the two packages: Java Swing and the Extensible Markup Language (XML). Swing allows us to add graphical components to the interface quite easily. XML allows users to create \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/tech_reports/reports/CGC-013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-FE5botU6lsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
