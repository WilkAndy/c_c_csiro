Available source and sink terms are incorporated in the model. Advection terms are derived from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) analysed grids. Statistics for the variation in the advective terms are derived and incorporated in the model from the ECMWF data base. Model output is compared with CO2 observations obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geophysical Monitoring for Climatic Change (GMCC) program. Model estimates of the yearly averaged latitudinal gradient of CO2 concentration match the observed CO2 concentrations except over the southern oceans. A biospheric growing season net flux (GSNF) of 6.5 Gt C was found, from model simulations, to explain the observed seasonal cycle in CO2 concentrations.
