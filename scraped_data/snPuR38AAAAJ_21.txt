The simulated N2O surface concentrations in the northern hemisphere (NH) are in general agreement with atmospheric observations, about 1 ppb higher than in the southern hemisphere (SH). The results suggest that N2O concentrations over strong source regions in continental interiors are much higher than those over oceans. Simulated N2O concentrations in the NH vary strongly with the season, while the measured concentrations oscillate strongly without seasonality. The modelled results for the SH show much less seasonal variation, which is more consistent with atmospheric measurement data. Most atmospheric N2O monitoring stations are not well situated for verifying the simulated seasonality in atmospheric N2O. There is only one continental site. In addition, atmospheric N2O \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6398162045160196825", "cites_id": ["6398162045160196825"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96GB00191", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2QopLXvWylgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
