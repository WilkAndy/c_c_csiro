In this paper we examine the parameter estimation problem. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare methods for fitting statistical distributions to such data where the distributional form is known. Three methods are investigated for estimating the parameters of the lognormal distribution, two methods for the exponential distribution, three methods for the \u03b3-distribution and four methods for the Weibull distribution. For all distributions and for each method we examine the accuracy with which the upper percentiles of the distribution are evaluated as it is these percentiles which are referred to by air quality standards. For each distribution a simple empirical model, which yields approximations to the relative root \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=31323636961026559", "cites_id": ["31323636961026559"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698186900739", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_6Eijq5IbwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 7, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
