The chosen sources are most relevant to simulation of the structure of atmospheric CO2. The sources are representations of the annual mean input of CO2 due to fossil fuel combustion and cement production and the seasonal fluxes associated with the action of terrestrial biota. Twelve different three-dimensional atmospheric tracer transport models have been used in this intercomparison. The models include both online and offline types and use a variety of advection algorithms and sub-grid scale parameterizations. A range of model resolutions is also represented. The modelled distributions show a large range of responses. For the fossil fuel source, the annual mean large-scale north-south gradient at the surface varies by a factor of two. This suggests a factor of two variation in the efficiency of interhemispheric exchange. In the upper troposphere zonal mean gradients within the northern hemisphere vary in sign. For the terrestrial biotic source, the structure of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of CO2 concentration at the surface is largely conditioned by the position of the sources. The annual mean response to the seasonal source also shows large differences in magnitude. We discuss the implications of these results for carbon budget studies and suggest some methods for reducing the apparent large uncertainties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11346197835362972315", "cites_id": ["11346197835362972315"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/236768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m7IdCNHKdZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 8, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
