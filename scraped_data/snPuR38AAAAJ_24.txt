The features of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), a measure of the electrical activity of the heart, can be equally variable in LQTS patients, posing well-described diagnostic dilemmas. Here we report a correlation between QT interval prolongation and T-wave notching in LQTS2 patients and use a novel computational framework to investigate how individual ionic currents, as well as cellular and tissue level factors, contribute to notched T waves. Furthermore, we show that variable expressivity of ECG features observed in LQTS2 patients can be explained by as little as 20% variation in the levels of ionic conductances that contribute to repolarization reserve. This has significant implications for interpretation of whole-genome sequencing data and underlies the importance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18206877835854577647", "cites_id": ["18206877835854577647"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:738Lc-3Sq_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 12, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
