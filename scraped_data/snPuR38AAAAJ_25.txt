One heavy-duty engine, a DDC Series 60, used in highway trucks, and one medium-duty engine, Navistar DTA-466, used in pick-up and delivery type vehicles. The medium-duty engine was tested for engine out emissions and with two different sized exhaust oxidation catalysts. Both of the catalysts were composed of a ceramic monolith coated with a palladium type catalyst. Both engines were tested according to the US EPA transient emissions test on a series of diesel fuels blended with varying aromatics and PAH contents to determine the impact of fuel quality on emissions. All diesel fuels had a low sulphur content (<0.05%) to minimize the formation of sulphate. The particulate matter was collected on teflon-coated filters, backed up with polyurethane foam filters to capture the vapour phase PAH. The PAH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9768945930935568420", "cites_id": ["9768945930935568420"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/44612466", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JIhp65BEkocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 6, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4}}
