Traditional EP analysis usually investigated the characteristics based on a fixed time scale and therefore ignored the continuity of EP occurrence. As a result, a comprehensive assessment on the influence and consequence of the EP occurring during consecutive time periods were largely eliminated. On the other hand, the characteristics of EP, including variables such as frequency, intensity and extreme volume, were commonly defined without sufficient consideration of the local tolerance capacity (which can be represented by a threshold level of EP) and therefore would sometimes be inappropriate. In this study, we proposed a concept of event-based extreme precipitation (EEP) by considering the continuity of EP and defined the statistical variables for the characteristics of an EEP event by taking account of local \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4380925281764928643", "cites_id": ["4380925281764928643"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415007970", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g2wgJ1UszDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
