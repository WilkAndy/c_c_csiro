Recently, satellite data and general circulation models have been used to simulate air\u2010sea exchange inventories with high resolution and global coverage. Here, we discuss the differences between a 3\u2010D global atmospheric CO transport model run with a homogeneous ocean to atmosphere CO flux (35 Tg CO yr\u22121), and a larger spatially and temporally varying ocean CO flux (153 Tg CO yr\u22121). Both ocean sources of atmospheric CO are within previous estimates of the ocean to atmosphere flux. The model sensitivity calculations show that the ocean can account for between 5 \u2013 50 % of the total surface level atmospheric CO pool, over large areas of the northern and southern hemisphere oceans. Oceanic CO fluxes to the atmosphere are important in both hemispheres, with a greater relative influence occurring in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=611570502603988360", "cites_id": ["611570502603988360"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/92GL01475", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iF3RwiG8fAgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 5, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
