A box diffusion CO2 exchange model shows that a transient forcing of 500 Gt C (the amount proposed to have accumulated in peatlands during the last interglacial\u2013glacial transition) over 5000 yr results in a lowering of atmospheric CO2 by about 40 ppm. Proxy data indicate that a decrease in atmospheric CO2 may have occurred over the last 5000 yr up to preindustrial times, and the amount is similar to that calculated from Holocene peatland expansion (\u223c22 ppm). These results suggest that models should consider the role of peatlands in ice-age initiation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3743225003351339732", "cites_id": ["3743225003351339732"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/potential-role-of-peatland-dynamics-in-iceage-initiation/E1394E426E765B9FBE9D781D4CCE9BC1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1PId306b8jMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
