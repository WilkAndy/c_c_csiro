Specific consideration is given to identification of a model from the exponential, lognormal, Weibull and gamma distributions. The performance of a likelihood ratio statistic and a Kolmogorov ratio statistic are examined by Monte Carlo simulation. On the basis of these results a procedure for increasing the probability of correct selection is proposed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12734434364616515362", "cites_id": ["12734434364616515362"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610918508812453", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ip9-rpXMubAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 5, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
