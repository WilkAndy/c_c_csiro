The community has invested millions of dollars and years of effort to build key components. However, although the investments in these separate software elements have been tremendously valuable, a great deal of productivity has also been lost because of the lack of planning, coordination, and key integration of technologies necessary to make them work together smoothly and efficiently, both within individual petascale systems and between different systems. It seems clear that this completely uncoordinated development model will not provide the software needed to support the unprecedented parallelism required for peta/ exascale computation on millions of cores, or the flexibility required to exploit new hardware models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 925, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2675086881372247371", "cites_id": ["2675086881372247371"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094342010391989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SxWAa1jRHyUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 51, "2012": 92, "2013": 82, "2014": 107, "2015": 110, "2016": 93, "2017": 88, "2018": 71, "2019": 69, "2020": 39, "2021": 39, "2022": 34, "2023": 8}}
