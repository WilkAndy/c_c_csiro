This paper proposes a subspace symbolization approach, namely SUDS, for content-based retrieval on very large video databases. The novelty of SUDS is that it explores the data distribution in subspaces to build a visual dictionary with which the videos are processed by deriving the string matching techniques with two-step data simplification. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive approach, called VLP, to extract a series of dominant subspaces of variable lengths from the whole visual feature space without the constraint of dimension consecutiveness. A stable visual dictionary is built by clustering the video keyframes over each dominant subspace. A compact video representation model is developed by transforming each keyframe into a word that is a series of symbols in the dominant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16996875175543932721", "cites_id": ["16996875175543932721"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5184840/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MYfzOesH4esJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
