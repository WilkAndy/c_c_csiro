The natural or unperturbed component is equivalent to that part of the atmospheric CO2 distribution which is controlled by non-anthropogenic CO2 fluxes from the ocean and terrestrial biosphere. Models should be able to reproduce the true north\u2013south gradient in CO2 due to the natural component before they can reliably estimate present-day CO2 sources and sinks and predict future atmospheric CO2. We have estimated the natural latitudinal distribution of atmospheric CO2, relative to the South Pole, using measurements of atmospheric CO2 during 1959\u20131991 and corresponding estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
