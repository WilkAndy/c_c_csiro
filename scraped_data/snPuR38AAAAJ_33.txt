For biogenic sources the uncertainty is caused by their extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity. For the anthropogenic sources political, economic and cultural factors are major uncertainties associated with scaling-up. Zero-, one- and two-dimensional models are useful tools to explain historic time series of observations. Although no unique solutions are found for emissions, analysis of historic emission sources can provide an understanding of the total source strength and its increase in time, and the relative importance of sources. The impossibility to find unique solutions also occurs in forward and inverse simulations with three-dimensional models. Common problems of three-dimensional atmospheric models is that time-averaged emissions and wind fields are used for large grids, or the meteorology is taken \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5391611234060634098", "cites_id": ["5391611234060634098"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1465997200000271", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8ocw9dnZ0koJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
