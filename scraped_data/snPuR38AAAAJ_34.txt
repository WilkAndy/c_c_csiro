There are two impor-tant reasons. First, to satisfy the objectives of air quality management, information is re-quired on the properties of the distribution of air pollutant concentrations. Second, more detailed information, such as a time series of pollutant observations, is more difficult to model. By focusing attention on the distribution, the modeling task can be simplified yet remain consistent with the objectives of air quality management. How can knowledge of the frequency distributions be obtained? Two cases must be distin-guished to answer this question. In the first case, random samples of pollutant concentration are already available for the locations of interest. An appropriate probability distribution must then be identified from a range of candidate parametric forms and its parameter values must be estimated. As will be seen, a satisfactory parameterization can serve a number useful purposes in air quality management, despite the fact that statistical distribution models are purely phenomenological. That is, they characterize the phenomena of most interest, the concentrations of individual pollutants contributing to ambient air quality, but are non-causal in that they do not embody direct relationships with any of the variables which yield the phenomena."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2879012685131721066", "cites_id": ["2879012685131721066"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2879012685131721066&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aqkekchO9CcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 7, "1991": 4, "1992": 4, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
