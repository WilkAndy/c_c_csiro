In many cases, water quantity and quality are equally important but their objectives in model calibration usually conflict with each other, so it is not a good practice to calibrate one after another. In this study, a combined auto-calibration multi-process approach was proposed for the integrated water system model (HEQM) using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This ensures that the model performance among inseparable or interactive processes could be balanced by users based on the Pareto front. The Huai River Basin, a highly regulated and heavily polluted region of China, was selected as a case study. The hydrological and water quality parameters of HEQM were calibrated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=603992533964016255", "cites_id": ["603992533964016255"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941630261X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f8rpcQLQYQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 2}}
