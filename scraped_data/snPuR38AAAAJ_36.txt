A modified Kolmogorov\u2010Smirnov (KS) test was used to ascertain the extent of Weibull behavior for perpetual January and July model runs. The modified KS test has been applied to 400 days of both perpetual January and July model runs using a 0.5\u2010day time sample. A global map of the KS statistic for each of the January and July control runs has been generated. These maps are presented for both the ocean and land wind fields. For the January oceanic winds, 29.2% of the frequency distributions were non\u2010Weibull at the 95% confidence level. Over land, 35.4% of the wind speed frequency distributions were judged to be non\u2010Weibull. For the July wind speed data, 32.7% of the ocean data sets were judged to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3917513121940932690", "cites_id": ["3917513121940932690"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JC094iC09p12693", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Uog4tG3NXTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
