CFCl3 is studied using the Australian National University's Chemical Transport Model. Unit\u2010pulse responses are derived from the model, and used to identify a time\u2010varying state\u2010space model of tropospheric CFCl3. This in turn is used in a Kaiman filter to perform two input\u2010estimation studies. The first uses model generated measurements to estimate known flux strengths. This demonstrates the robustness of the method, although it is found that instantaneous stratospheric loss rates are not well\u2010estimated using only surface concentration measurements. Emissions however, are robustly estimated. A time\u2010aver aged tropospheric lifetime can be estimated however, with an accuracy of \u00b15 years.
