Source functions are included for the release of CO from the oxidation of methane, technological sources, biomass burning, the oxidation of hydrocarbons and the oceans. The removal of CO from the atmosphere is assumed to be largely due to oxidation through reaction with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and removal by soils. To compute CO destruction, a parameterised OH field, calibrated to reproduce the loss of methyl chloroform, is employed. For the removal of CO by soils, a model is used which assumes that the flux of CO into soils is dependent on net primary productivity. To constrain the magnitude of the CO sources and sinks, atmospheric observations of CO are used. The deduced total CO source is 1855\u20132355 Tg.
