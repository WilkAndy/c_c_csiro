The model combines a deterministic component, the GM model (Chock, 1978), with a statistical component, the two-parameter Weibull distribution, to produce estimates of the entire distribution of pollutant concentration. The approach is demonstrated using hourly average carbon monoxide data recorded in Melbourne, Australia. Using a second data set a model validation exercise is performed. The hybrid model has worked well, producing estimates of pollutant concentration with an accuracy better than a factor of two over all percentiles of the distribution of pollutant concentration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18138325613742594133", "cites_id": ["18138325613742594133"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969785902943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VRh_cwtHuPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
