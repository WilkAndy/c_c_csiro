Over the last few years, our knowledge of the carbon cycle has increased, particularly in the quantification and identification of mechanisms for terrestrial exchanges, and in the preliminary quantification of feedbacks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 612, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15731662031872754969,7039338796174760611", "cites_id": ["15731662031872754969", "7039338796174760611"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-03384881/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GYVGoEQXUtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 14, "1996": 34, "1997": 38, "1998": 34, "1999": 43, "2000": 45, "2001": 58, "2002": 35, "2003": 33, "2004": 29, "2005": 26, "2006": 24, "2007": 12, "2008": 16, "2009": 26, "2010": 13, "2011": 21, "2012": 18, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 20, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
