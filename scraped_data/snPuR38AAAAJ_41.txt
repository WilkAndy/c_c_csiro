The model is hybrid in character, combining reliable features of a deterministic ATDL-based model with statistical distributional approaches. The gamma distribution was identified from a range of distributional models as the best model. The paper shows that the assumptions of a previous hybrid model may be relaxed and presents a methodology for characterizing the uncertainty associated with model predictions. Results are demonstrated for the 98-percentile predictions of 24-h average data over annual periods at six monitoring sites. This percentile relates to the World Health Organisation goal for acid gas concentrations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1253298141749023061", "cites_id": ["1253298141749023061"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004698185900228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VZGbCAWcZBEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
