Applications discussed utilise GPUs and multi-core CPUs on a scale ranging from single desktop workstations through to large GPU clusters. Results demonstrate that both types of system can successfully accelerate a variety of practical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14439494809122265903", "cites_id": ["14439494809122265903"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCSE.2013.055356", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L1vUcQZkY8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
