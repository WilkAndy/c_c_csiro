A dramatic reduction in the annual streamflow into Danjiangkou Reservoir (ASDR), the water source of MRP, during 1990 has raised some concerns on the MRP's operation. This paper employed an advanced segmented regression model with more recent data to have a clear picture and understand the changing pattern of the ASDR. Our study first revealed a zigzag changing pattern (decreasing\u2010increasing\u2010decreasing\u2010increasing) of ASDR during 1960\u20132013, which was supported by statistical criteria compared with a monotonic or single abrupt change. Particularly, the significantly decreasing trend from 1990s was reversed after 2000, and such change may relieve the concern about the water availability in the future. Sensitivity analysis showed that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16293624158890325088", "cites_id": ["16293624158890325088"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JD025702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YHRhXtiUHuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
