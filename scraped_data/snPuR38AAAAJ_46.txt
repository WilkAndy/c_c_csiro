The toolbox is based on software packages and libraries developed over the last 10-15 years by CSIRO scientists and software engineers:(a) HCA-Vision: developed for automating the process of quantifying cell features in microscopy images;(b) MILXView: a 3D medical imaging analysis and visualisation platform increasingly popular with researchers and medical specialists working with MRI, PET and other types of medical images and (c) X-TRACT: developed for advanced X-ray image analysis and Computed Tomography.
