Understanding the precise effect of competition demands a knowledge of density as well as growth analysis, so it is a complication that Maranon and Grubb have not fully faced. They have, however, gone back to the field to check where the small-and largeseeded plant species mainly occur. In the richer, deeper soils with higher organic matter derived from tree leaf-litter, largeseeded species, such as the grass Bromus diandrus and the thistle Carduus pycnocephalus, were typical. In the shallow, resource-poor sites, small-seeded species, such as the smooth catsear Hypochoeris glabra and the grass Agrostis pourretti, predominated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1209802022477643874", "cites_id": ["1209802022477643874"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/366515b0.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YkBUlocUyhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
