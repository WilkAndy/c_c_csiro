Recruitment can be by vegetative expansion but in many species it is by seedlings. The population dynamics of 4 legume species (Stylosanthes hamata, S. scabra, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Cassia rotundifolia) are outlined, and the importance of seed production and soil seed banks for persistence of these species is highlighted. The effects of management (grazing, fertiliser, fire, pests and diseases) on Survival, soil seed levels and recruitment are out-lined, and examples are given of how these effects are reflected in changes in pasture com-position. Some management guidelines based on the understanding derived from these demographic studies are presented. Most paddocks are not uniform, and the influence of variation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7894290129526440787", "cites_id": ["7894290129526440787"], "pub_url": "https://www.tropicalgrasslands.info/public/journals/4/Historic/Tropical%20Grasslands%20Journal%20archive/PDFs/Vol_27_1993/Vol_27_04_93_pp302_313.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U8NLDAwnjm0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
