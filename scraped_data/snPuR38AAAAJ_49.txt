There are numerous papers in applying various DL techniques, such as auto-encoder, restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, etc., to MCM problems ranging from component-level condition monitoring (machine tool wear prediction, bearing fault diagnosis and classification and hydraulic pump fault diagnosis) to system-level health management (aircraft and spacecraft diagnosis). In this paper, we give a brief overview in the area of DL for MCM with a focus on reviewing the most recent papers published since 2019. In Part 1, we present some critical views regarding whether any breakthrough has been achieved from an MCM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12203202122377989939", "cites_id": ["12203202122377989939"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40857-021-00222-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mw-iyqx7WqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
