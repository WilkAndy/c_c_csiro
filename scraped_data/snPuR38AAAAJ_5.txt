Fractionation of the oxygen isotopes of CO2 occurs in plants owing to differential diffusion of C18O16O and C16O2 and to isotope effects in oxygen exchange with chloroplast water. Kere we investigate the consequences of these effects for the global distribution of oxygen isotopes in CO2. We predict that 18O isotopic exchange fluxes, especially between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere, are large, with considerable spatial variation. Near 70\u00b0 N, where precipitation (and soil water) is most depleted in 18O, photosynthesis and respiration both deplete the atmospheric CO2 of O. This provides an explanation for the depletion of 18O in atmospheric CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 488, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4944658486191378481,8659094156857114071", "cites_id": ["4944658486191378481", "8659094156857114071"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/363439a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MdAO_bH0nkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 10, "1995": 10, "1996": 18, "1997": 11, "1998": 15, "1999": 15, "2000": 18, "2001": 18, "2002": 27, "2003": 22, "2004": 16, "2005": 17, "2006": 19, "2007": 18, "2008": 23, "2009": 15, "2010": 13, "2011": 18, "2012": 22, "2013": 16, "2014": 18, "2015": 16, "2016": 19, "2017": 14, "2018": 14, "2019": 12, "2020": 17, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
