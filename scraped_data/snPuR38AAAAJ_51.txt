Biomass smoke distributions were estimated via a seasonally-varying source function that produced monthly mean estimates of the flux of trace gases to the atmosphere which were then confirmed qualitatively using satellite observations. The direct effect was modeled by assuming new cloud fractions wherever biomass smoke occurred. A sensitivity study was conducted to determine the most appropriate way to add these new `clouds'. An indirect effect on existing clouds was modeled by reducing the cloud optical depth (which increases reflectivity) when they coincided with biomass smoke. Advection of the smoke has been accomplished by adding it as a tracer in the NCAR CCM3 (the atmospheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13416987031063201860", "cites_id": ["13416987031063201860"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815298000772", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RIiLVp62MroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
