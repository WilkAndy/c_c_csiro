We take a three-pronged approach to this study; (1) examine only the direct short-wave forcing of the smoke clouds by imposing smoke \u2018clouds\u2019 in the model, (2) examine the indirect effect of biomass smoke by allowing the biomass smoke to modify the optical properties of existing clouds, reducing the effective (mass) droplet radius, and (3) examine the downstream effect by advecting biomass smoke using semi-Lagrangian transport in the GCM. Preliminary results from the GCM simulations suggest strong local coolings (2\u20134\u00b0C or more) where biomass burning occurs with somewhat reduced regional coolings. Initial results of the transport of smoke by the Australian National University CTM (ANU-CTM) show the biomass smoke to remain fairly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17997590082883056559", "cites_id": ["17997590082883056559"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266983896000391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r3NWN9NIxPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
