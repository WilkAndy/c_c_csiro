Atmospheric N, O is considered to have increased from about 285 ppbv prior to the year 1700 to 310 ppbv by 1990 and is continuing to increase at a rate of 0.2-0.3% per year. N, O is estimated to have 206 times the radiative forcing per molecule re! ative to CO, partly as a consequence of the estimated lor, g atmospheric lifetime for N, O of 150 years. Removal of N, O fi,, rn the atmosphere nearly all occurs through photolysis and reaction with electronic-ally excited oxygen atoms [I]. Removal by soils may account for a small loss of N, O.While the removal mechanism for N, O from the atmosphere appears to be well understood and the atmospheric increase can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15079581620159735566", "cites_id": ["15079581620159735566"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037847549290157C", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dmchp5ZvRdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
