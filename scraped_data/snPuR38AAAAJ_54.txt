The approach minimizes discrepancy between the expected and measured linear absorption coefficients and maximizes Boltzmann distribution probability. It enables integration of both the 3D X-ray CT data-constraints and global level information, and leads to more accurate predictions of microscopic 3D compositional distributions in material samples. Permeability simulations and comparisons with experimentally measured porosity indicate that DCM characterisation agrees reasonably with experimental observations. However, segmentation of CT images leads to under-estimation of porosity and permeability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1331434059065166388", "cites_id": ["1331434059065166388"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/463/1/012048/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NIpv9Dg0ehIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
