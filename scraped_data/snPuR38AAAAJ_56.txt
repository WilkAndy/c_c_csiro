Here we present forward runs of an atmospheric transport model to test hypotheses on recently derived source and sink estimates. Most atmospheric N2O monitoring stations are not well situated for verifying the simulated seasonality in atmospheric N2O. In addition, the precision of N2O measurements is not adequate for resolving seasonal trends. The global N2O inventory used does not account for soil-N2O consumption in temperate nitrogen-limited ecosystems and observed episodic emissions in temperature ecosystems during thaw periods, autumn and from snow-covered soils. These potential errors and possible underestimation of N2O emissions from combustion and industrial sources may exaggerate the simulated seasonal trends."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13264965249489131492", "cites_id": ["13264965249489131492"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166111606802542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5FezFZ2fFrgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
