In this study a mathematical model is developed to quantify the key factors determining the local \u2019mixing volume\u2019 and hence the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. It was found that the seasonal variation in horizontal advection is more important than the seasonal variation in PBL depth in determining the local mean and seasonal variation in atmospheric CO2 and that cloud transport plays a minor role."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5690772574890696624", "cites_id": ["5690772574890696624"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1998GL900018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sB_lf4Gv-U4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
