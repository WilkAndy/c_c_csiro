We have simulated the emissions, transport, and concentration of SF6 for a 5-year period, and compared the results with atmospheric observations. In addition, we have performed an intercomparison of interhemispheric transport among 11 models to investigate the reasons for the differences among the simulations. Most of the models are reasonably successful at simulating the observed meridional gradient of SF6 in the remote marine boundary layer, though there is less agreement at continental sites. Models that compare well to observations in the remote marine boundary layer tend to systematically overestimate SF6 at continental locations in source regions, suggesting that vertical trapping rather than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11515325748620430393", "cites_id": ["11515325748620430393"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/tellusb.v51i2.16286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OQxu78Gnzp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 8, "2000": 7, "2001": 13, "2002": 17, "2003": 13, "2004": 17, "2005": 12, "2006": 15, "2007": 12, "2008": 5, "2009": 13, "2010": 12, "2011": 10, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 3, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
