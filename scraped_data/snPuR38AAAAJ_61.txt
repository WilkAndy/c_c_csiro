A box-diffusion global carbon cycle model (ANU-BACE) incorporating a biosphere/atmosphere CO2 exchange model has been developed which accurately accounts for the observed atmospheric CO2 record. The biosphere is clearly a significant sink for CO2 taking up nearly 2 Gt C in 1990. A major component of this sink is occurring in tropical forests. While the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to increase, the biosphere will remain an important sink for CO2 significantly reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. However, a steady or declining CO2 concentration will result in a rapidly diminishing biospheric CO2 sink.
