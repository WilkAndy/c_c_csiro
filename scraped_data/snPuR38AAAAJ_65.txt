We demonstrate our solution on a cluster of nodes containing multiple CPU cores and GPUs. The algorithm uses a combination of message passing and massively-multicore programming technologies to achieve nested levels of parallelism, ranging from course grained domain decomposition across worker processes to more fine grain parallelism within worker processes utilising GPUs. The work distribution and worker framework is abstracted from the type of processor architecture used for core algorithm calculation by different worker processes. Allocation of computational resources (different processors or cores) to workers is handled collaboratively by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2519215072397077360", "cites_id": ["2519215072397077360"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2519215072397077360&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cKsJz8IM9iIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
