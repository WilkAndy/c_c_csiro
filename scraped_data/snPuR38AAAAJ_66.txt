The first is an empirical quantile-quantile model. It requires firstly that a more complete date set be available from a base site within the same airshed, and secondly that the base and restricted data sets are drawn from the same distributional form. A two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is applied to test the validity of the latter assumption, a test not requiring the assumption of a particular distributional form. The second model represents the a priori selection of a distributional model for the air quality data. To demonstrate this approach the two-parameter lognormal, gamma and Weibull models and the one-parameter exponential model were separately applied to all the restricted data sets. A third model employs a model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=950368352451002118", "cites_id": ["950368352451002118"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00394214", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Bn-dNftiMA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
