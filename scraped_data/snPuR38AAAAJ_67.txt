The deterministic component of the hybrid model is based upon the Gaussian plume model, while the distributional models are identified from amongst the two-parameter lognormal, Weibull and gamma, and the one-parameter exponential distribution models. Using the deterministic model component output calibrated about the 50\u201390 percentile concentrations, the hybrid model produces estimates of 24-, 8-, 3-, 1-, 0.5-h average sulphur dioxide data to an accuracy of a factor of 2 for the 98-percentile, second-highest and maximum concentrations. The effect of the method of calibration of the deterministic component upon the statistical component of the hybrid model is examined in detail."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11887512425359909082", "cites_id": ["11887512425359909082"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304380087900718", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2qCecJHt-KQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
