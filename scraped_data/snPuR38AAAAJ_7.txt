The models include both on\u2010line and off\u2010line types and use a variety of advection algorithms and subgrid scale parameterizations. A range of model resolutions is also represented. The modeled distributions show a large range of responses. For the experiment using the fossil fuel source, the annual mean meridional gradient at the surface varies by a factor of 2. This suggests a factor of 2 variation in the efficiency of surface interhemispheric exchange as much due to differences in model vertical transport as to horizontal differences. In the upper troposphere, zonal mean gradients within the northern hemisphere vary in sign. In the terrestrial biotic source experiment, the spatial distribution of the amplitude and the phase of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3919146091838755088", "cites_id": ["3919146091838755088"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96GB01892", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ENHoIpuaYzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 7, "1999": 18, "2000": 19, "2001": 14, "2002": 17, "2003": 11, "2004": 11, "2005": 6, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
