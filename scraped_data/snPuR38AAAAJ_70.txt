It is well understood that the method of maximum likelihood provides more efficient estimates of the parameters and traditional distributional(moment-related) properties of the three-parameter gamma and lognormal distributions than the method of moments. However, little attention has been given directly to quantifying performance for high percentiles which are of interest in air quality applications [I]. The method of maximum likelihood yields better estimates of all percentiles of the underlying parent distribution for the parameter space investigated. The method of moments was found to yield the better fit to the sample maximum and second \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2212036063597073023", "cites_id": ["2212036063597073023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378475490902339", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f5IOeRS7sh4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
