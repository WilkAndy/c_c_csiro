Samples of source raw and finished water were collected from more than 270 surface and groundwater supplies in the New England States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. The samples were analyzed at EPA laboratories. Historical records were obtained dating back to 1886. Acid rain may dissolve harmful elements from soils and, indirectly, from water supply distribution systems. Because soils can alter the character of acid rain through buffering, causal relationships are difficult to identify. A helpful approach to this problem is the use of indices of water supply sensitivity and corrosiveness. Though solution products of acid rain in water supply sources studied do not exceed EPA Primary Drinking \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6620751017904633272", "cites_id": ["6620751017904633272"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6620751017904633272&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uPWC-Pih4VsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2}}
