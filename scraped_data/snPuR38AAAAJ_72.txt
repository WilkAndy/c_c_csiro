The ability to make long-range forecasts of sea surface temperature variations and extreme marine heatwave events has potentially significant economic and societal benefits, especially in a warming climate. We have developed a deep learning time series prediction model (Unet-LSTM), based on more than 70 years (1950-2021) of ECMWF ERA5 monthly mean sea surface temperature and 2-metre air temperature data, to predict global 2-dimensional sea surface temperatures up to a 24-month lead. Model prediction skills are high in the equatorial and subtropical Pacific. We have assessed the ability of the model to predict sea surface temperature anomalies in the Nin \u0303o3.4 region, an ENSO index in the equatorial Pacific, and the Blob marine heatwave events in the northeast Pacific in detail. Model hindcasts of the Nin \u0303o3.4 index capture the strong 2010-11 La Nin \u0303a and 2009-10 El Nino well. An assessment of the predictions of the 2019-20 El Nin \u0303o and the 2016-17 and 2017-18 La Nin \u0303a show that the model has skill up to 18 months in advance. The prediction of the 2015-16 extreme El Nin \u0303o is less satisfactory, which suggests that subsurface ocean information may be crucial for the evolution of this event. Note that the model makes predictions of the 2-d monthly SST field and Nino 3.4 is just one region embedded in the global field. The model also shows long lead prediction skills for the northeast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12023955685231551250", "cites_id": ["12023955685231551250"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.932932/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Climate&id=932932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EuNDdf2r3aYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
