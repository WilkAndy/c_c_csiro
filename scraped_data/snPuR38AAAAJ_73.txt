A significant source of the fine particulates as well as the greater part of black amorphous particles > 2 \u03bcm in city centre samples has been traced by TEM observation to be car emissions. In the suburban site of Kambah TEM displayed charcoal in the black amorphous particles. Further studies using microprobe analysis have shown Pb-Br content in all the fine particulates in the city samples whereas none have been detected in Kambah due to their low concentrations (the presence of small amounts of high electron-dense crystals was visible in TEM observations of Kambah samples). However, high Pb concentrations at both sites correlate well with the fine fraction, indicating that care needs to be taken in interpreting the microprobe results.
