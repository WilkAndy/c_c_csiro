In spite of considerable effort, estimating the global movement of mercury through the environment is difficult. However, anthropogenic emissions of mercury are at least double those from natural sources and are of such magnitude that they cannot be attributed to natural sources alone [Fitzgerald et al. 1998]. Emissions are considered to be increasing in Asia and decreasing in North America and Europe.On the basis of current estimates of the atmospheric burden and the flux of mercury to the atmosphere, we can estimate the lifetime of atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg\u00ba) to be around one year, while the lifetime of atmospheric divalent mercury (Hg-II) to be one to three days. A lifetime of one year implies that Hg\u00ba is a global pollutant, while the much shorter lifetime of Hg-II implies that it is a local to regional pollutant. Therefore, to understand the link among emissions, emissions speciation, and final deposition, we need to take a regional to global approach. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose that the global biogeochemical cycle of mercury be modeled and studied in detail. We suggest that an approach combining state-of-the-art techniques for inventory estimation with high-resolution global tracer transport modeling is required to reduce the fundamental scientific uncertainties associated with the release, transport, transformation, and ultimate removal through deposition of mercury to the land and ocean."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8323266274049740853", "cites_id": ["8323266274049740853"], "pub_url": "ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/tech_reports/reports/CGC-003.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NVC545MugnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
