Pollutants examined are carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, total suspended particulates and fine particles. The calibration of generalised box models requiring only windspeed inputs and pollutant measurements is used to help quantify the relative strengths of the source types. The box models can also be combined with other source quantification techniques such as the construction of emission models for historical or projected traffic patterns. By adopting reasonable assumptions, it is shown that parametric probability functions can be fitted to annual or seasonal frequency distributions of pollutant data. These are used to infer underlying trends when observation periods contain uniformly or randomly missing measurements. For conservative pollutants, annual or seasonal trends can be further adjusted on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6617740366140011894", "cites_id": ["6617740366140011894"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438009290112R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dvWJ-8zv1lsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
