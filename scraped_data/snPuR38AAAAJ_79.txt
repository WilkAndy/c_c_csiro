It is both computationally and data intensive, and therefore can benefit from infrastructure in the \u201csupercomputing\u201d domain for research purposes, such as Synchrotron science. Our group within CSIRO has been actively developing X-ray tomography and image processing software and systems for HPC clusters. We have also leveraged the use of GPU's (Graphical Processing Units) for several codes enabling speedups by an order of magnitude or more over CPU-only implementations. A key goal of our systems is to enable our targeted \u201cend users\u201d, researchers, easy access to the tools, computational resources and data via familiar interfaces and client applications such that specialized HPC expertise and support is generally not required in order to initiate and control data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11975673002312499300", "cites_id": ["11975673002312499300"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6404464/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZIASUSUjMqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
