Significant uncertainties remain in estimates of the fluxes of CO2 from biomass burning and deforestation, and uptake and storage of CO2 by the biosphere arising from increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Calculation of probable rates of carbon sequestration for the major ecosystem complexes and global 3-D tracer transport model runs indicate the possibility that a significant net CO2 uptake (> 1 Pg C yr-1), a CO2 'fertilisation effect', may be occurring in tropical rainforests, effectively accounting for much of the 'missing sink'. This sink may currently balance much of the CO2 added to the atmosphere from deforestation and biomass burning. Interestingly, CO2 released from biomass burning may itself be playing an important role in enhanced carbon storage by tropical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 194, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7101929720735149906", "cites_id": ["7101929720735149906"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/bt9920407", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ui81EHQfj2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 6, "1995": 8, "1996": 11, "1997": 6, "1998": 13, "1999": 13, "2000": 10, "2001": 9, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 9, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
