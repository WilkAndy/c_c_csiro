X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used as a nondestructive method to probe the internal structures of materials. However, x-ray CT only gives a microscopic map of the radiation\u2019s amplitude attenuation and phase shift and is usually inadequate to determine compositional distributions within heterogeneous materials by the usual image-rendering process. 5 Data-constrained modeling (DCM) has extended the reach of x-ray CT techniques to more directly determine a sample\u2019s material composition. By combining a generic model with sample-specific CT data taken under multiple x-ray beam conditions, we have shown that DCM can provide microscopic details of compositional distributions in a wide range of samples. 6\u20139DCM for predictive modeling of microscopic compositions is based on a number of assumptions. The total volume of a voxel (3D pixel) is the sum of the partial volumes of its constituent material compositions (including void).
