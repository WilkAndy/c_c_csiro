The novelty of SUDS is that it explores the data distribution in subspaces to build a visual dictionary. With this dictionary, the video data are processed using string matching techniques with two-step data simplification. A compact video representation model is developed by transforming each keyframe into a word that is a series of symbols in the dominant subspaces. Then, we present an innovative similarity measure called ED, which draws from the concept of the edit distance on strings to conduct video matching. The experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of SUDS with optimal parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1037117080676890636", "cites_id": ["1037117080676890636"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4812498/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DHg8cH2UZA4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
