A number of useful visualization and analysis tools already exist, each with its own set of unique strengths. A translation tool is needed to convert data from the large number of model output formats into formats suitable for use with visualization and analysis tools. Such a translator would allow a researcher using a climate model to easily exploit a large number of visualization and analysis tools. Our goal is to develop a translation tool for UNIX computer systems that will be highly portable, very simple to use, and easily expandable. The translation program, The ANU translator will feature a graphical user interface when run on any system with an X11 interface. It will work with a number of climate model formats, including: CCM1, CCM2, RegCM2, MM5, CSIRO9, and ANU-CTM. It will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16703405910970191094", "cites_id": ["16703405910970191094"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266983896000202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9syJdi1rzucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
