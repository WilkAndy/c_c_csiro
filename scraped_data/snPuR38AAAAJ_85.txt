There are numerous papers in applying various DL techniques, such as auto-encoder, restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, to MCM problems ranging from component level condition monitoring (machine tool wear prediction, bearing fault diagnosis and classification and hydraulic pump fault diagnosis) to system level health management (aircraft and spacecraft diagnosis). In this paper, we give a brief overview in the area of DL for MCM with a focus on reviewing the most recent papers published since 2019. In Part 1, we present some critical views regarding whether any breakthrough has been achieved from an MCM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10357467037539775090", "cites_id": ["10357467037539775090"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40857-021-00235-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cjJg-WQdvY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
