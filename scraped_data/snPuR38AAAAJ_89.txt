By providing user-friendly access to cloud computing resources and new workflow-based interfaces, our solution enables researchers to carry out various challenging image analysis and reconstruction tasks. Several case studies will be presented during the conference."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1515983820714988207", "cites_id": ["1515983820714988207"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4824998", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r9L0vkDbCRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
