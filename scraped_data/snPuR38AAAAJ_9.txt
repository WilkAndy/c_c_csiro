By comparison with methyl chloroform observations a global average tropospheric hydroyl radical concentration of 6.4\u00d7105 cm\u22123 was found to be consistent with published methyl chloroform emission data for the year 1980. Published methyl chloroform emissions data for 1981\u20131984 were found to be inconsistent with the observed methyl chloroform concentration increases. A large decrease in hydroxyl radical concentrations could explain the disagreement between the emission data and atmospheric methyl chloroform concentrations, but this is unlikely. Using the hydroxyl radical field calibrated to the methyl chloroform observations, the globally averaged release of methane and its spatial and temporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2264613138601052718", "cites_id": ["2264613138601052718"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/90JD02016", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Lor_r6aFbR8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 4, "1992": 7, "1993": 14, "1994": 7, "1995": 8, "1996": 11, "1997": 4, "1998": 8, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
