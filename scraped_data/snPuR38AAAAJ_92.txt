Research on this topic has almost exclusively focused on the behavior of firms. This project report presents the CIFE Seed Grant research completed to date on the structural mechanisms that might contribute to an explanation of this phenomenon. Our research focused primarily on product and process innovations of a systemic nature (ie, those that require multiple specialist firms to change their process in a coordinated fashion) though we also investigated localized innovations (ie, those that imply change only within a specific specialty type). Systemic innovations researched include integrated supply chain management, the prefabrication of building systems, and the evolution to virtual design and construction. By gaining insight into the mechanisms that impact adoption of systemic innovations in the AEC industry, we can hope to bridge the innovation gap. In doing so we can begin to capture the productivity gains that manufacturing industries earned in adopting systemic innovations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9730631321306373263", "cites_id": ["9730631321306373263"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond-Levitt/publication/237725413_Bridging_the_Innovation_Gap_in_Project-based_Industries_2003-2004_CIFE_Seed_Project_Report/links/548881230cf2ef3447909d61/Bridging-the-Innovation-Gap-in-Project-based-Industries-2003-2004-CIFE-Seed-Project-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j5zBsqElCocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
