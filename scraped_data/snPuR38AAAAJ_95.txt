Espresso was designed to be an extensible interface to both scientific models and Grid resources. It also aims to be a contemporary piece of software that relies on Globus.org\u2019s Java CoG Kit for a Grid toolkit, Sun\u2019s Java 2 API and is configured using XML. This article covers the design and implementation of Espresso\u2019s Grid functionality and how it interacts with existing scientific models. We give specific examples of how we have designed Espresso to perform climate simulations using the PSU/NCAR MM5 atmospheric model. Plans to incorporate the CCSM and FOAM climate models are also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7306550711306765648", "cites_id": ["7306550711306765648"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46080-2_82", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UEXRACkVZmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1}}
