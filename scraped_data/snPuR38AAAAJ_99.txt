Young (1) has used a systems theoretic framework to espouse a general theory of modeling based upon the scientific method to cope with uncertainty. We show a hybrid deterministic/statistical approach consistent with this general theory can be used when such systems have a phenomenological property which can be simply characterised. The methodology is especially relevant to the assessment of air quality systems and details are provided of a comprehensive program within the Centre for Resource and Environmental studies (CRES) to develop a suite of algorithms for predicting the probability distribution of ambient pollutant concentrations from a range of emission sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "snPuR38AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17915313904136261099", "cites_id": ["17915313904136261099"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378475485900370", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:642ojxP7n_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1}}
