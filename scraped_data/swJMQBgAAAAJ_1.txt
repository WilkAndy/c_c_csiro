Structural and functional characteristics of roots contribute to rhizosphere processes and both have significant influence on the capacity of roots to acquire nutrients. Roots also interact extensively with soil microorganisms which further impact on plant nutrition either directly, by influencing nutrient availability and uptake, or indirectly through plant (root) growth promotion. In this paper, features of the rhizosphere that are important for nutrient acquisition from soil are reviewed, with specific emphasis on the characteristics of roots that influence the availability and uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen. The interaction of roots with soil microorganisms, in particular with mycorrhizal fungi and non-symbiotic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, is also considered in relation to nutrient availability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 1942, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11444551182137730681", "cites_id": ["11444551182137730681"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-009-9895-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eaYYEao2054J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 11, "2010": 38, "2011": 63, "2012": 79, "2013": 115, "2014": 120, "2015": 146, "2016": 164, "2017": 175, "2018": 172, "2019": 188, "2020": 179, "2021": 207, "2022": 176, "2023": 94}}
