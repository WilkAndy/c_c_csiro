Agricultural soils generally contain large amounts of total phosphorus but only a small proportion (< 1%) is immediately available for plant uptake. The application of P-based fertilizers to increase soil and plant productivity generally leads to a net accumulation of total soil P. The availability of accumulated soil P to plants is largely influenced by the activity of soil microorganisms through their ability to solubilize and mineralize inorganic and organic soil P fractions. Microbially-mediated transformation of major soil P fractions is very important to the soil P cycle. The soil microbial biomass contains a substantial pool of immobilized P that is potentially available for plant nutrition. Strategies for utilizing soil microorganisms to improve phosphorus availability are reviewed. These include the introduction of mycorrhizal fungi, inoculation of soil-grown plants with P-solubilizing bacteria of fungi, and inoculation with P-mineralizing microorganisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 402, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18068427343155409288", "cites_id": ["18068427343155409288"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19951907604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iLG7HvDyv_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 13, "2003": 7, "2004": 12, "2005": 12, "2006": 7, "2007": 11, "2008": 16, "2009": 16, "2010": 16, "2011": 17, "2012": 17, "2013": 33, "2014": 21, "2015": 23, "2016": 33, "2017": 31, "2018": 17, "2019": 25, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
