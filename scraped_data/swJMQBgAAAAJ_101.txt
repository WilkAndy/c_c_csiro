The soils were either unfertilised or had received superphosphate either from 1994 to 1997 or applied annually to 2002. P-fertilisation led to an increase in both the inorganic and organic P content of the soils, but with differences in the distribution of organic P in various extractable pools. Fertilisation also affected the amount of organic P that was amenable to hydrolysis by a non-specific phosphatase. In particular, the amount of water-extractable organic P that was phosphatase-labile was greatest in soil that had received continuous fertiliser application. Despite improved phosphatase-lability of different organic P pools in the fertilised soils, transgenic Trifolium subterraneum L., which releases extracellular phytase, showed no consistent advantage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5552825238644216015", "cites_id": ["5552825238644216015"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR06167", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z1A2aSKZD00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
