These include control of rhizosphere pH, exudation of organic acids and root phosphatases. Possibilities for manipulating these processes in order to improve phosphorus acquisition in agricultural plants are discussed in the context of the phosphorus cycle in agriculture."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3561183783589291046", "cites_id": ["3561183783589291046"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-66902-9_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JqS4gMjdazEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
