Reusing scrap tyres in the form of rubber crumb in concrete could benefit the environment by contributing to the percentage of tyres used for a variety of recycling processes such as carpet underlay or tyre derived fuel, thus reducing disposal of tyres to landfill sites and the chemical usage of air entraining agents as a means of achieving freeze/thaw protection.Concrete cubes of 100mm were produced from design mixes which have been classified as plain, air entrained and rubber crumb and subjected to freeze/thaw cycles at 5 days of age.Thawing was conducted in water to ensure full saturation of pores and maximum stress on the concrete samples. The rubber crumb and plain concrete mixes were compared against the freeze/thaw performance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13241361110963000849", "cites_id": ["13241361110963000849"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jgb/article-abstract/6/1/83/199340", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ERafUcbDwrcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
