CAB International, Wallingford, United Kingdom", "pages": "221-241", "abstract": "A large proportion (up to 80%) of soil phosphorus occurs in organic forms (Harrison, 1987), of which derivatives of inositol phosphates constitute a considerable fraction (Anderson, 1980; see Turner, Chapter 12, this volume). The bioavailability of inositol phosphates depends on their mineralization by phytases (myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate phosphatases), which come in several classes (EC 3.1. 3.8, EC 3.1. 3.26 and EC 3.1. 3.72), that initially cleave phosphate at different positions on the myo-inositol ring (see Mullaney and Ullah, Chapter 7, this volume). Phytases were first recognized almost a century ago (Suzuki et al., 1907; Dox and Golden, 1911) and have many biological sources, including plants, animals and a wide range of microorganisms (Table 14.1). They are particularly important in the soil environment, having been identified in plant roots, fungi, yeasts and bacteria (Irving, 1980).
