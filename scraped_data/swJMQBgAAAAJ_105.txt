The aim of this study was to use sequential chemical fractionation to identify which forms of P have accumulated in soil under permanent pasture from a medium\u2010term (13 y) field experiment. Treatments included an unfertilized pasture (P0), and treatments designed to maintain soil P fertility at near \u2018optimum' (P1) and \u2018supra\u2010optimum' (P2) levels for pasture growth; all levels of soil P fertility were continuously grazed with either a moderate or high stocking rate (SR09 and SR18). Summed concentrations of extractable inorganic and organic P, and residual P (i.e., non\u2010extractable P) accounted for 20, 31, and 49% of total soil P (as determined by laboratory X\u2010ray fluorescence), respectively, across all surface (0\u201310 cm) and subsurface (10\u201320 cm) soil layers.
