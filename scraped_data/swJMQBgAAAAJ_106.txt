Fibre orientation, type of rupture failure mode and post\u2010crack performance were examined.Even structural fibre dispersion was found to be best achieved with the use of monofilament polypropylene fibres (19\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200922 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9375595932815025171", "cites_id": ["9375595932815025171"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800510610143/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E2QJrdPOHIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
