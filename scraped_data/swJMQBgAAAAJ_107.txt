What is less readily understood is the use of Type 2 synthetic fibres to provide toughness. This problem is exacerbated by the wide range of synthetic fibres available, with each different fibre providing different structural properties. This paper seeks to address this issue.The paper examines the relative pull\u2010out values of two single fibre types, i.e. steel and Type 2 synthetic fibres. The pull\u2010out test results have informed the doses of fibre additions to beams which have been used to equate near equal toughness performance for each fibre type.The results show that synthetic Type 2 fibres, when used at a prescribed additional volume, can provide toughness equal to steel fibre concrete.The scientific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17364953558134715494", "cites_id": ["17364953558134715494"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630801011089155/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZnTG9UG1_PAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
