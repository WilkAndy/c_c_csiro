To test the importance of root intermingling in the interaction of citrate and phytase exudates, Nicotiana tabacum plant\u2010lines with constitutive expression of heterologous citrate (Cit) or fungal phytase (Phy) exudation traits were grown under two root treatments (roots separated or intermingled) and in two soils with contrasting soil P availability. Complementarity of plant mixtures varying in citrate efflux rate and mobility of the expressed phytase in soil was determined based on plant biomass and P accumulation. Soil P composition was evaluated using solution 31P NMR spectroscopy. In the soil with limited available P, positive complementarity occurred in Cit + Phy mixtures with roots intermingled. Root separation eliminated positive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10131966084867681764", "cites_id": ["10131966084867681764"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ppl.12718", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5O3XBHn5m4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
