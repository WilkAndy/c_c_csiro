While previous studies have examined a wide range of above\u2010ground parameters in ecotones, soil microbial communities have received little attention. Here we investigated spatial patterns, composition, and co\u2010occurrences of archaea, bacteria, and fungi, and their relationships with soil ecological processes across a woodland\u2010grassland ecotone. Geostatistical kriging and network analysis revealed that the community structure and spatial patterns of soil microbiota varied considerably between three habitat components across the ecotone. Woodland samples had significantly higher diversity of archaea while the grassland samples had significantly higher diversity of bacteria.
