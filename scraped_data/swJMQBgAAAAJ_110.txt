The main aim of our work was to elucidate the rhizosphere microbial community underlying a Rhizoctonia suppressive soil (Avon, South Australia) and to investigate how this community may develop in agricultural soils conducive to disease and of different soil type (Galong and Harden, New South Wales). The Avon suppressive soil community included Asaia spp. and Paenibacillus borealis, which were absent from a paired non-suppressive site. At Galong, soil taken from inside and outside disease patches showed no evidence of suppression, and disease suppression could not be transferred from the suppressive soil to the conducive soil from a different soil type and climatic area. 16S rRNA microarray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4014117737685143836", "cites_id": ["4014117737685143836"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139314000511", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HFFRkdACtTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
