(subterranean clover) during autumn\u2013winter at 17 pasture sites across a broad agricultural area of temperate southern Australia. Between 9 and 93% (median 21%) of T. subterranean seedlings failed to emerge at the 14 locations where soil moisture was considered adequate for germination. Post\u2010emergence losses were lower (range 0\u201332%; median 7%). Moderate damage (lateral roots) to severe damage (taproots) was recorded on surviving test plants at all of the sites. Sublethal damage to pasture roots constitutes a potentially large, but underestimated cost to production because it was so widespread and because the damage occurs during autumn\u2013winter when pasture yield limits stocking rate.
