The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method of generating randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) from simple bacterial cell lysates was applied to nodule isolates obtained from field plots of clover (Trifolium spp.) and medic (Medicago spp.) plants inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Trifolium and Rhizobium meliloti. Comparison of the PCR method with gel immune diffusion serology was applied to selected nodule isolates obtained from the clover trial. Agreement between the methods was high (97\u00b76%). Further characterisation of nodule isolates from the 2 field trials proceeded using PCR amplification profiles only, which allowed a large number of isolates to be quickly and precisely \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14330185885832038007,10680304066725566418", "cites_id": ["14330185885832038007", "10680304066725566418"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/A98007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d8ZVeiMM38YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
