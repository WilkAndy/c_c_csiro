This study investigated the interaction of citrate and phytase exudation in controlling the accumulation of P and depletion of soil organic P by transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants. N. tabacum plant lines including wild-type, vector controls, transgenic plants with single-trait expression of a citrate transporter (A. thaliana frd3) or fungal phytases (phyA: A. niger, P. lycii) and crossed plant lines expressing both traits, were characterized for citrate efflux and phytase exudation. Monocultures and intercropped combinations of single-trait plants were grown in a low available P soil (12 weeks). Plant biomass, shoot P accumulation, rhizosphere soil pH and citrate-extractable-P fractions were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11350738044838089386", "cites_id": ["11350738044838089386"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-016-2884-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qhIW7RzshZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
