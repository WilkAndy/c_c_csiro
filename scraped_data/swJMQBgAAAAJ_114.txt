In this study, PCR-based methods were developed for detection and quantification of the Bacillus \u03b2-propeller phytase (BPP) gene. Experiments were conducted to monitor the presence and persistence of a phytate-mineralizing strain, Bacillus sp. MQH19, after inoculation of soil microcosms and within the rhizosphere. The occurrence of the BPP gene in natural pasture soils from Chilean Andisols was also examined. The results showed that the BacillusBPP gene was readily detected in sterile and nonsterile microcosms, and that the quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods could be used to monitor changes in the abundance of the BPP gene over time. Our results also show that the addition of phytate to nonsterile soils induced the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16944268771977649333", "cites_id": ["16944268771977649333"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/83/2/352/493251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tdx4bKwiJusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
