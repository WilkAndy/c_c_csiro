This trend reduces the impact on the environment and the use of finite natural resources. This paper aims to investigate whether concrete which includes crushed, graded and washed recycled construction demolition waste, used as a coarse aggregate, can be manufactured to a comparable strength as concrete manufactured from virgin aggregates.Laboratory testing investigated the strength development of concrete manufactured with varying degrees of coarse aggregate replacement. All of the concrete samples were tested at five, seven, 14 and 21 days and the concrete with the recycled aggregate was compared to a plain control sample manufactured with virgin aggregates. The mixes tested against the control sample were: 100 per cent gravel replacement with recycled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=790562316579020447", "cites_id": ["790562316579020447"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630801011044244/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n56ABD2k-AoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
