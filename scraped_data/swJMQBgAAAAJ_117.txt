Nicotiana tabacum plant lines with unique organic anion (OA) and phytase production patterns were used to investigate the effect of OA-driven solubilization on the bioavailability of precipitated and sorbed IHP. Organic anions released IHP sorbed to goethite (Gt) by chelation or reductive dissolution mechanisms in the order: ascorbate> citrate> oxalate> pyruvate> acetate. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing Peniophora lycii phytase (PHY) and a MATE-type citrate transporter (CIT) exuded 2.2-to 2.6-fold higher OA compared with that of wild-type plants. The PHY plants had 33-fold higher exudate phytase activity (6.0\u00d7 10\u2212 2 nkat plant\u2212 1 day\u2212 1) compared with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14599300992409699899", "cites_id": ["14599300992409699899"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Fulltext/2012/10000/Organic_Anion_Driven_Solubilization_of.3.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O4aW9eYim8oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
