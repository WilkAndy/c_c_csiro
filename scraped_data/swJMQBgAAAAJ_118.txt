However, these forms alone do not explain the existence of, or account for the processes responsible for, a larger pool of \u201cunresolved\u201d organic P that exists in soils. We critically reviewed the historic literature and carried out a global compilation of quantitative data to understand the chemical nature of soil organic P, including insight on what might constitute unresolved forms. We identified five key eras spanning the mid-1800s to current. Understanding of the chemical nature of organic P has largely reflected the predominant analytical technique in use, which generally involved focusing on a particular class of organic P. While inositol phosphates have been a focus throughout most eras, quantitative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18256314129962209626", "cites_id": ["18256314129962209626"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211319301063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WpFXoPl0W_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
