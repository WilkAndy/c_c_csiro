From tropical rain forests to the open oceans, organisms depend on organic phosphorus turnover for their phosphorus nutrition and have evolved complex adaptations that allow them to compete efficiently for this scarce resource (eg Lambers et al., 2006; Whitton et al., 2005). Yet organic phosphorus continues to be largely overlooked in biogeochemical, agricultural, and ecological research, and remains poorly understood in comparison to inorganic phosphorus. This limits our understanding of phosphorus cycling in ecosystems, inhibits the development of sustainable agricultural practices, and constrains our ability to predict the response of the earth's major biomes to global change. In 2003, the first organic phosphorus workshop was held at Mont\u00e9 Verita in the mountains of southern Switzerland. The meeting brought together a multidisciplinary group of scientists seeking to unravel the complexity of organic phosphorus in the environment. The resulting book Organic Phosphorus in the Environment (Turner et al., 2005) overviewed the state of the field at that time in a series of review chapters on topics ranging from the detection of organic phosphorus compounds in environmental samples to the dynamics of organic phosphorus in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Since the meeting in Mont\u00e9 Verita there have been a number of important conceptual and methodological developments that have significantly advanced our understanding of soil organic phosphorus dynamics. Many of these were presented at two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12770218061973442167", "cites_id": ["12770218061973442167"], "pub_url": "https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/26671/Geoderma%20257-258%201-3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d040-KrtOLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
