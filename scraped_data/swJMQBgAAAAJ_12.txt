Consequently, we hypothesised that the sequestration of C-rich crop residue material into the FF-SOM pool could be improved by adding supplementary nutrients to the residues based on these ratios. Here we report on the effect of N, P and S availability on the net humification efficiency (NHE), the change in the size of the FF-SOM pool (as estimated by fine fraction C (FF-C)), following incubation of soil with wheaten straw. Four diverse soils were subjected to seven consecutive incubation cycles, with wheaten straw (10 t ha\u22121 equivalent) added at the beginning of each cycle, with and without inorganic N, P, S addition (5 kg N, 2 kg P and 1.3 kg S per tonne of straw).
