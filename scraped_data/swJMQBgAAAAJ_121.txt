Data were collected after 20\u202fyears of P fertilization (average 19\u202fkg\u202fP\u202fha\u22121\u202fyear\u22121) compared to a non-P fertilized control, on a P deficient soil. The high P treatment had higher productivity and stocking rate (hereafter termed fertilization treatment). Soils to a depth of 110\u202fcm were analysed for soil bulk density, whole soil C and nitrogen (N), and for C, N, P and sulphur (S) that was associated with a soil pool of fine fraction C (FFC). Fertilization and higher stocking rate had no effect on soil pH but led to a decrease in soil bulk density to depth, and an increase in total soil C that was associated with an increase in both the whole soil C (WSC) and the FFC throughout much of the soil profile. The increase in soil C was evident in both the C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11499962787072617225", "cites_id": ["11499962787072617225"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706118317385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CaustTkTmJ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
