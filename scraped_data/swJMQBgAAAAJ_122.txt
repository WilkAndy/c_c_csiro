However, the chemical nature of the accumulated organic P remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to use solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on sodium hydroxide\u2013ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH\u2010EDTA) extracts to identify the chemical nature of organic P in soils from a medium\u2010term (13 years) permanent pasture field experiment. This included an unfertilized pasture (P0), and treatments designed to maintain soil P fertility at near \u2018optimum' (P1) and \u2018supra\u2010optimum' (P2) levels for pasture growth; pastures at all levels of soil P fertility were continuously grazed with either a moderate or high stocking rate (SR09 and SR18). Approximately 20% of the fertilizer P added to pastures was recovered as organic P in NaOH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17658157982866932687", "cites_id": ["17658157982866932687"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jpln.201600076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zwOD5CBhDvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
