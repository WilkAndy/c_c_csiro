Improved techniques are needed for such studies.This study used in situ and destructive sampling techniques and compared two exudate extraction methods [anion exchange membrane (AEM) capturing and water extraction] from rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere samples of genetically modified (GM) and control Pinus radiata D. Don trees grown in large-scale rhizotrons for ~10 months. Metabolically active soil microbial communities were analysed using rRNA-DGGE.Recovery of eight out of 12 anions was influenced by extraction methods, and in situ sampling using AEM was shown to be the most efficient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16577921111045989701", "cites_id": ["16577921111045989701"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-012-1198-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RWVYumqbEOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
