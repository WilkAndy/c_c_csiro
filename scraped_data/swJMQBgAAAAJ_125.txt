The aim of this experiment was to determine the fate of fertiliser P in clover pastures under field conditions.A procedure was developed to radiolabel SSP granules with a 33P radiotracer, which was then applied to the soil surface (equivalent to ~12 kg P ha\u22121) of a clover pasture. Recovery of fertiliser P was determined in clover shoots, fertiliser granules and soil fractions (surface layer: 0\u20134 cm and sub-surface layer: 4\u20138 cm).The P diffusion patterns of the 33P-labelled SSP granules were not significantly different to those of commercial SSP granules (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Recovery of fertiliser P in clover shoots was 30\u201335 %.
