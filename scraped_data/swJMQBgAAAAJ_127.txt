The findings show monofilament fibres to play a significant role in protecting the concrete matrix against the forces encountered. External cube integrity was shown to be a poor indicator of structural condition. A significant aspect of the work is the range of tests applied to the freeze/thaw concrete cubes against the control sample. Strong evidence of condition was obtained from ultrasonic, compressive strength and weight loss. Surface scaling was not a satisfactory indication of the structural condition of the concrete."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3067417445063779380", "cites_id": ["3067417445063779380"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800310511569/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NOTcFuqnkSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
