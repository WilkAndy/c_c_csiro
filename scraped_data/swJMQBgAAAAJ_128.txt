This study examined the role of root morphology traits in response to P supply.Nine Rytidosperma species ranging from slow- to fast-growth were examined along with Lolium perenne and Bromus hordeaceus. Plants were grown in a glasshouse for 47 days in soil supplied with six levels of P between 0 and 60 mg P per pot. Root mass, length and diameter, root hair length and density, and extent of mycorrhizal colonisation were measured.Across all species there was a positive correlation (P < 0.001) between P uptake and root mass, length and root hair cylinder volume (RHCV; estimated using root diameter, root hair length and root length) at all levels of P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5600915512267487851", "cites_id": ["5600915512267487851"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-016-2933-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a7qtxftyuk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
