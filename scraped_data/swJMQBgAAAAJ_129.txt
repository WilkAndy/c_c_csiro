Our study evaluated the importance of differences in root structure and function, and the differential composition of the bacterial community in four sugarcane cultivars, in relation to the efficiency for P uptake and also to assess changes in soil P with distance from the rhizoplane. Experiments were performed in pot trials using a sandy clay loam Ferralsol. In the first experiment, the effect of P application (78.4 mg P kg-1 soil as triple superphosphate) on sugarcane cultivars RB92-579; RB85-5156; RB86-7515 and RB96-6928 was investigated. Secondly, we evaluated P rates of 0; 9.8; 19.6; 39.2 and 78.4 mg kg-1 soil using cultivar RB96-6928 which was shown to be one of the more growth responsive cultivars. The cultivar RB96-6928 exhibited the highest root dry matter and root surface area, while the bacterial communities found in the rhizosphere of these plants were not different from other cultivars, as determined by PCR-DGGE. From the P dose-dependent experiment for this cultivar, optimal plant performance occurred at a P supply up to 38.5 mg P kg-1 soil. Collectively, our results indicate that P efficiency in sugarcane was predominantly associated with the generation of high root biomass and surface area."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11482909831510365676", "cites_id": ["11482909831510365676"], "pub_url": "https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-95162016005000064&script=sci_arttext", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7BUEF6d9W58J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
