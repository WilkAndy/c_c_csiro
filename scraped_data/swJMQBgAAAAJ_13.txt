This is notable in intensive wheat rotations which are widely used. Expectations are that this gap can be reduced by manipulating soil processes, especially those that involve microbial ecology. Cross\u2010year analysis of the soil microbiome in an intensive wheat cropping system revealed that rhizosphere bacteria changed much more than the bulk soil community. Dominant factors influencing populations included binding to roots, plant age, site and planting sequence. We demonstrated evolution of bacterial communities within the field rhizosphere. Early in the season, communities tightly bound to the root were simplest. These increased in diversity with plant age and senescence. Loosely bound communities also increased in diversity from vegetative to reproductive plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 286, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11396464098103868637", "cites_id": ["11396464098103868637"], "pub_url": "https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.12452", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Tz5VrdfKJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 31, "2018": 18, "2019": 32, "2020": 49, "2021": 67, "2022": 54, "2023": 11}}
