These environments are increasingly being altered by anthropogenic disturbances, which potentially alter ecosystem service provision. Dryland salinity is one such disturbance and is becoming increasingly prevalent in Australian soils. We used microarrays and analysis of soil physicochemical variables to investigate the methane-oxidizing communities of several Australian natural woodland soils affected to varying degrees by dryland salinity. Soils varied in terms of salinity, gravitational water content, NO3-N, SO4-S and Mg, all of which explained to a significant degree MOB community composition. Analysis of the relative abundance and diversity of the MOB communities also revealed significant differences between soils of different salinities.
