The aim of this work was to evaluate the interaction between available soil P and P. bilaii inoculation on plant growth.Maize plants (Zea mays) inoculated with P. bilaii and non-inoculated were grown in pot experiments in three soils with different inherent P availability, and in a low P availability soil with different additions of mineral P, both with and without supplementation of all other macro and micronutrients.We found a positive interaction between P bilaii and available P, when other nutrients were applied, with P bilaii inoculation resulting in increased root growth and thus nutrient uptake and plant growth.
