The present study focused on paired sites of native remnant woodland and managed pasture at three locations in south-eastern Australia. Improved understanding of N cycling is important for assessing the impact of agriculture on soil processes and can guide conservation and restoration soil management strategies to maintain remnant native woodland systems, which currently exist as small pockets of woodland within extensive managed pasture landscapes. Organic and inorganic N pools were quantified, as well as the rates of amino acid and peptide mineralisation in the paired native woodland and managed pasture systems. Soil DON dominated the soil N pool in both land uses, and the proportion of DON to other N pools was greatest at the most N-limited site (up to \u223c70% of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11933443323299010204", "cites_id": ["11933443323299010204"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071715000905", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nJZ--HkbnKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
