This work was carried out to determine structural qualities that may lead to potential enhanced performance when concrete is subjected to a bomb blast and in addition the same structural qualities may act as a safety measure in earthquake situations. The majority of injuries caused from bomb attacks are a result of fragmented building components energised by the blast wave, therefore it is vital to reduce fragmentation of concrete. It is known that fibre reinforcement can reduce fragmentation of concrete by increasing energy absorption. A three point beam test was conducted on two batches of beams reinforced with straight steel and 3D fibres respectively, so that flexural strength and post crack toughness could be calculated and compared.
