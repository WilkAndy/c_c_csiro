However, poor spectral sensitivity (related to the signal to noise ratio) can limit its applicability for soils of low organic P content, especially in subsurface layers. Sensitivity can potentially be improved by employing a much narrower (1:4) soil to solution ratio than usual (1:10 or 1:20), which increases the density of P in the NMR tube. Pasture soils were collected at two depths (0\u20134 cm and 4\u201310 cm) from across the high rainfall zone of eastern Australia, and were extracted with NaOH\u2013EDTA at a 1:4 and 1:10 extraction ratio. The extracts were analysed for molybdate-reactive P (i.e. an estimate of inorganic P), and total extractable concentrations of aluminium (Al), iron (Fe \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11444709161364927892", "cites_id": ["11444709161364927892"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000440", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lLXQeFjG054J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
