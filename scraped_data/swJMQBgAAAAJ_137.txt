The findings show a small, but significant difference between the electrolytic transport properties of cement grout with monofilament polypropylene fibre additions when compared to grout without fibre additions. The grout with fibre additions suggests a reduced probability of water and ion transmission, due to higher measured resistivity, which will result in enhanced durability and lower life cycle costs. Durability of reinforced concrete structures, is known to be closely linked to the water permeability of the concrete matrix. This potential trend for enhanced durability can be added to the other benefits of using monofilament polypropylene fibre in concrete, such as low absorption, freeze/thaw resistance, fire resistance and micro reinforcement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1207285612950496588", "cites_id": ["1207285612950496588"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800410549053/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TKVaVt4jwRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
