In order to quantify species-specific root biomass from measurements of DNA, consideration needs to be given to replication and ability to recover roots for calibration purposes in order to account for spatial, temporal and inter- and intra-species variation in DNA content of roots and distribution of roots within the soil profile.This paper develops the field application of a DNA-based technique for direct quantification of roots in soils. The method was applied to a field experiment to investigate differences in root growth of acid-soil resistant and sensitive genotypes of perennial pasture grasses in an acid soil. DNA was extracted directly from soil and species-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3270094294734697058", "cites_id": ["3270094294734697058"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-012-1405-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YnKxc2-1YS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
