Inability of plants to effectively use phytate-P is associated with poor substrate availability in soil environments, and insufficient extracellular root phytase activity. We therefore generated transgenic lines of Trifolium subterraneum L. that expressed the phytase (phyA) gene from Aspergillus niger. Analysis of segregating T1 populations of these plants showed that the presence of an extracellular phytase was effective in improving the P nutrition of the plants when supplied with phytate and grown in agar under sterile conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14445327628131657939", "cites_id": ["14445327628131657939"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47624-X_271", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:02jscvEceMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
