Plants showed limited ability to obtain P from inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), whereas other monoester substrates such as glucose 1\u2010phosphate (G1P), were equivalent sources of P for plant growth as compared with inorganic phosphate (Pi). Poor utilization of IHP was exemplified by significantly lower rates of dry matter accumulation and reduced P content of tissues, which were generally not significantly different to control plants that were grown in the absence of added P. The inability of wheat seedlings to obtain P from IHP was not associated with poor substrate availability but was due to either insufficient root phytase activity or inappropriate localization of phytase within root tissues. Phytase activities of 4 and 24 mU g\u22121 root fresh weight (FW) were determined for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 284, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11743060749668213234", "cites_id": ["11743060749668213234"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00557.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8mHOz4i796IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 10, "2005": 13, "2006": 7, "2007": 15, "2008": 14, "2009": 12, "2010": 14, "2011": 17, "2012": 23, "2013": 14, "2014": 14, "2015": 18, "2016": 20, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
