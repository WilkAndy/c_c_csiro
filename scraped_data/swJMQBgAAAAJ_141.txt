Ensuring a supply chain of recycled materials affords many potential gains, achieved through: reducing the material volume transported to already over-burdened landfill sites, possible cost reductions to the contractor/client when considering the landfill tax saved and the potential for lower cost material replacements, a reduction in the environmental impact of quarrying and the saving of depleting natural material resources.Reuse of Materials and Byproducts in Construction: Waste Minimization and Recycling addresses use of waste and by products in the construction industry. An over view of new \u201cgreen\u201d design guides to encourage best practice will be examined and current legislation that channels on site practices, such as site waste management plans. Fundamental individual construction materials are discussed and the process \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9898742134475239123", "cites_id": ["9898742134475239123"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-5376-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:066WiIZlX4kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
