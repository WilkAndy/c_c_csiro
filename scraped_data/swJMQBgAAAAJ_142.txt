The rhizosphere is an extremely complex environment with simultaneous spatial and temporal interactions between soil, plants, and microorganisms. There are significant technical challenges associated with the collection and analysis of root exudates and investigation of rhizosphere microbial communities. Design of in vitro and in situ systems to study interactions between root exudates and composition of microbial communities remains an important issue. Various experimental systems under controlled conditions have been described and a range of techniques used to demonstrate links between root exudates and microbial community structure and function. Nonetheless, our understanding of direct links between root exudates and microbial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17733623342327308589", "cites_id": ["17733623342327308589"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118297674.ch11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LaH-G3l8GvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
