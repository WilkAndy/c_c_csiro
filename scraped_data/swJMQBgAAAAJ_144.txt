These systems often require the addition of fertiliser phosphorus (P) for maximum pasture growth, and it is now estimated that a four-fold increase in the use of P fertiliser in grasslands is needed to meet increased food demand by the year 2050. However, the recovery of P from fertiliser is often inefficient and global issues associated with P scarcity will continue to worsen. Knowledge on the uptake of fertiliser P by grasslands, including the effect of agronomic management, remains incomplete under field conditions. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of soil P fertility (across three levels of soil P fertility), time of fertiliser application (at one level of soil P fertility), and placement of fertiliser (at one level of soil P fertility) on the growth and uptake of fertiliser P by clover pastures during a growing season.
