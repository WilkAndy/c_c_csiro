Proc 15th Aust Soc Agron Conf", "pages": "15-18", "abstract": "Farm-gate phosphorus (P)-balance (Pinput vs Poutput) was measured in grazing systems managed without P-fertiliser (P0), by increasing soil P (1994-2000) and then maintaining it (2001-2006) at near-optimum soil P fertility (target Olsen P= 10-12 mg/kg; P1), by increasing soil P and maintaining it at supra-optimal P-fertility (target Olsen P= 20-25 mg/kg; P2), or by fertilising to a supra-optimal level before allowing a return to the near-optimal level by withholding fertiliser (P1*). Pastures were grazed with either 9 (SR9) or 18 sheep/ha (SR18). P-export was in liveweight gain. Although fertilised paddocks accumulated 89-93% of their P input (fertiliser+ feed) over the whole experiment (1994-2006), this included P that was contributing to changes in soil fertility and P accumulating in sparingly-available pools. The efficiency of fertiliser use was better demonstrated by P-balance during the maintenance phase (2001-2006) where changes in soil fertility were small. When P contributing to soil fertility changes was accounted for, the accumulation of P in sparingly-available pools was 40-47 kg P/ha in P1 paddocks and 75 kg P/ha in P2 paddocks. Differences due to stocking rate were not significant. Although total P input and accumulation did not differ between P1* SR18 and P1SR18 paddocks, soil fertility was improving marginally in the P1SR18 treatment and declining in the P1* SR18 treatment. Managing paddocks at levels of soil P fertility higher than necessary proved costly because more P was required to both build and maintain high levels of soil fertility."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12456234327402800437", "cites_id": ["12456234327402800437"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2010/crop-production/nitrogen-phosphorus/7208_simpsonrj.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NeXe8x9v3awJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
