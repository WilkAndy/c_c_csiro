Un\u2010graded construction demolition waste and un\u2010graded ground glass were used as aggregate replacements. With regard to concrete, compressive strength is widely used as a measure of suitability as being fit for purpose. Therefore compressive strength was mainly used to compare the different concrete batches; however density was measured across the range of samples.The findings show that a lower average compressive strength is achieved when compared to the plain control sample \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2223089937425253161", "cites_id": ["2223089937425253161"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800910941692/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KUP6B4UA2h4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
