Effects of soil amendment with FC on different soil P fractions and influence on microbial community structure in the rhizosphere were also assessed. Two glasshouse experiments were conducted with completely randomized block designs. The first experiment evaluated rates of FC using a factorial design (5 \u00d7 2): 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 g FC kg\u22121 soil applied as either broadcast in bulk soil or in the planting furrow. The second experiment used a factorial design (2 \u00d7 3): without and with FC (5 g kg\u22121 soil, dry basis), both without P (NP) and with P supplied as either triple superphosphate (TSP) or as rock phosphate (RP), both at the rate of 78.4 mg kg\u22121 based on total P. Microbial community structure was determined using TRFLP and dynamics of soil P by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1488033928783695517", "cites_id": ["1488033928783695517"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sum.12484", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nY7havmOphQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
