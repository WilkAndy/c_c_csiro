Conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystems has generally resulted in a significant loss of soil organic-C (SOC, up to 50% or \u223c30\u201340 t ha\u22121) and \u2018restoring\u2019 this lost C is a significant global challenge. The most stable component of soil organic matter (SOM), hereafter referred to as fine fraction SOM (FF-SOM), contains not only C, hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), but substantial amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), in approximately constant ratios. The availability of these associated nutrients is essential for the formation of FF-SOM. Here we show, in short term (56 day) incubation experiments with 13C labelled wheaten straw added to four soils with differing clay content, that conversion of straw into \u201cnew\u201d FF-SOM is increased by up to three-fold by augmenting the residues with supplementary nutrients. We also show that the loss of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2707314826386364949", "cites_id": ["2707314826386364949"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713003337", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FVromX1QkiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 16, "2016": 25, "2017": 32, "2018": 29, "2019": 33, "2020": 37, "2021": 39, "2022": 44, "2023": 20}}
