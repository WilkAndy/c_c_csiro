As a consequence, lower life cycle costs and best value will be achieved for concrete use, with an ultimate reduction in the cost of maintaining the aging infrastructure. A unique aspect of this work is that heart and covercrete are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4223674003242683187", "cites_id": ["4223674003242683187"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800310479089/full/html?fullSc=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MwtVwiCBnToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
