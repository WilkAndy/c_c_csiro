P-related problems center around broken P cycles from local to global scales. This paper presents outcomes from the 9th International Phosphorus Workshop (IPW9) held 2019 on how to move towards a sustainable P management. It is based on two sequential discussion rounds with all participants. Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as finite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deficits were identified such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived science-practice/policy gap. While this gap may be smaller in reality as illustrated with a Swiss \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10669184067308618986", "cites_id": ["10669184067308618986"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-021-01562-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6gQwp2GOEJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
