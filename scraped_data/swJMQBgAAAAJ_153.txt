The contribution of sub-soil microorganisms to relatively stable fine-fraction carbon content may be critical for soil carbon sequestration. Here we assessed bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities at three different soil depths (over 90 cm) in a 25-year old crop-tillage trial in southeastern Australia. We explored the effect of soil depth on microbial community composition, network complexity and interkingdom associations to test whether microbial community characteristics could be linked to relatively stable fine-fraction carbon content. Our results showed that soil depth had a stronger impact than cropping practice on microbial abundance, diversity, taxonomic composition and community structure. Both bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity declined significantly along the depth continuum, whereas soil archaeal diversity increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15111939694614649273", "cites_id": ["15111939694614649273"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880921002632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uZmh9BVluNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 6}}
