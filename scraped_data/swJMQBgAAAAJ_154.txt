Previous investigations have focussed on the anchor and considered the anchor, in terms of dimensions and adhesive agents, but not specifically on the addition of synthetic or steel fibres to concrete. This paper addresses the practical aspect of anchor fixings and means of improving pull out performance, that will reduce the risk of failure for the designer and contractor or allow greater design loads."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=152017901088168897", "cites_id": ["152017901088168897"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan-Richardson-4/publication/229176222_Pullout_Performance_of_Chemical_Anchor_Bolts_in_Fibre_Concrete/links/555cc2ea08ae8c0cab2a668e/Pullout-Performance-of-Chemical-Anchor-Bolts-in-Fibre-Concrete", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wVvcwXkTHAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
