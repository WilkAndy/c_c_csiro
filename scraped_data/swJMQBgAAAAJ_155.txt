Nine Rytidosperma species, Lolium perenne and Bromus hordeaceus were grown as microswards in pots in a glasshouse, and their growth response to six levels of applied P was measured. Shoot yield differed up to twofold between the highest\u2010 and lowest\u2010yielding Rytidosperma species. Some Rytidosperma species were slow growing with minimal ability to respond to increased soil P availability. However, three species, Rytidosperma duttonianum, Rytidosperma racemosum and Rytidosperma richardsonii, had a similar shoot yield to L. perenne. Species that grew well at high P also grew well at low P, except B. hordeaceus, which was the lowest\u2010yielding species at low P, but had among the highest yields at high P. No species showed evidence of P toxicity. The species exhibited a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6333066678457983257", "cites_id": ["6333066678457983257"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gfs.12170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GeFZDJeS41cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
