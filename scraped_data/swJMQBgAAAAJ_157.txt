We examined bacterial and fungal community composition within mineral soil fractions using amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). We targeted bacterial non-specific acid (class A, phoN/phoC) and alkaline (phoD) phosphomonoesterase genes and quantified specific genes and transcripts using real-time PCR. Soil bacterial diversity was greatest after 4000 years of ecosystem development and associated with an increased richness of phylotypes and a significant decline in previously dominant taxa (Firmicutes and Proteobacteria). Soil fungal communities transitioned from predominantly Basidiomycota to Ascomycota along the chronosequence and were most diverse in 290- to 392-year \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9494351679491650301", "cites_id": ["9494351679491650301"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/97/4/fiab034/6145523", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_bK7nIy2woMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
