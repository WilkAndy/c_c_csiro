Such differences could, in agricultural situations in particular (where inorganic nutrients are often added), result from substantial concentrations of inorganic\u2010N, inorganic\u2010P and inorganic\u2010S that remain in the soil. We assessed the efficacy of removal of inorganic nutrients with different washing procedures (0.1 or 0.5\u2009m hydrochloric acid solution). Even after repeated additions of inorganic\u2010N, inorganic\u2010S and inorganic\u2010P to soil as part of a long\u2010term incubation experiment, washing soil with 0.1\u2009m HCl was effective at removing residual inorganic\u2010N and inorganic\u2010S, but not effective at removing inorganic\u2010P. We demonstrate that estimates of C:N, C:S and C:P ratios in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=710255490584126944", "cites_id": ["710255490584126944"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.12378", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4KUJCJtV2wkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
