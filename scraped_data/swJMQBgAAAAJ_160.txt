Bond strength was examined using 12 concrete cube specimens of 150\u2009mm, six cubes had steel rebar and six had FRP rebar inserted through the full depth of the cube and they were subject to pull out tests. To determine flexural strength and toughness, a three point loading test was performed to provide load/extension data on 28 500\u00d7100\u00d7100\u2009mm concrete beams. A total of 14 beams were cast with steel rebar and 14 were cast with FRP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13874674343745631128", "cites_id": ["13874674343745631128"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630801111118412/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mDMv8c2-jMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
