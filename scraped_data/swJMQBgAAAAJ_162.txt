Pseudomonas spp. can improve the availability of P to plants through the production of phytases and organic anions. Gluconate is a major component of Pseudomonas organic anion production and may therefore play an important role in the mineralization of insoluble organic P forms such as calcium\u2013phytate (CaIHP). Organic anion and phytase production was characterized in 2 Pseudomonas spp. soil isolates (CCAR59, Ha200) and an isogenic mutant of strain Ha200, which lacked a functional glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) gene (strain Ha200 gcd::Tn5B8). Wild-type and mutant strains of Pseudomonas spp. were evaluated for their ability to solubilize and hydrolyze CaIHP and to promote the growth and assimilation of P by tobacco plants. Gluconate, 2-keto-gluconate, pyruvate, ascorbate, acetate, and formate were detected in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1056821007089586623", "cites_id": ["1056821007089586623"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2015-0206", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v9G-ThuVqg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
