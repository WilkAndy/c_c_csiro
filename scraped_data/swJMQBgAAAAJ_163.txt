Plain control samples were used to determine the original concrete strength and this was used as a benchmark following high temperature heat tests to evaluate the surface condition and final compressive strength. A pilot study was used to determine an appropriate heat source for the test. This was three Bunsen burners, however sufficient heat could not be generated within 150\u2009mm concrete cubes and the concrete was shown to be a significant insulator and fire protection for structural members. The concrete test cubes were tested in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15108350974391694354", "cites_id": ["15108350974391694354"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800810922775/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EjSL6imlq9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
