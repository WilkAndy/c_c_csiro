The role of inositol phosphates in the environment, including the origins and biochemical transformations of the soil inositol phosphates and their detection by modern instrumental and isotopic techniques, was reviewed recently by Turner et al.(2002), and detailed reviews of the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for the analysis of inositol phosphates in environmental samples also appear in this volume (see Murthy, Chapter 2, and Cooper et al., Chapter 3). This chapter summarizes early work (1967\u20131969) on the extraction and characterization of inositol phosphates in soil using a range of analytical procedures, including electron-impact mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and proton NMR spectroscopy.
