Incorporation of plant residues with nutrient addition (nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur) may reduce these losses. We investigated the impact of initial soil fertility and supplementary nutrient addition on breakdown of sugarcane residue and associated changes in soil C following a pasture to crop transition. The legume-based pasture was previously managed with fertilizer to develop soils with high and low C. The soils were cultivated with sugarcane mulch (10 Mg ha\u22121), a C4 crop residue that enabled isotopic 13C tracking, with or without nutrients and sown to a triticale crop [Triticale (\u00d7 Triticosecale)]. Higher soil fertility with additional nutrients reduced the decrease in total soil C as a proportion of the initial C (14.9% compared to 21.8% without nutrients) to 100 mm depth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14244920638064807853", "cites_id": ["14244920638064807853"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-019-10037-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rc979dgfsMUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
