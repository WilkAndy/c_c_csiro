In most instances the nature of the visual defect or the results of radiological contrast studies make the position quite clear, and dictate the appropriate management. Occasionally, however, the character of the visual defect may be unusual, and radiological studies either negative or equivocal, making diagnosis uncertain and the indication for surgical exploration a matter of judgement. Four cases of progressive visual failure are reported here in which investigations were not conclusive in indicating the compressive lesion, but in which exploratory craniotomy revealed a tumour.Case Reports Case 1.-A medical practitioner aged 54 years was admitted to Atkinson Morley's Hospital on October 29, 1963, complaining of poor vision in the left eye.
