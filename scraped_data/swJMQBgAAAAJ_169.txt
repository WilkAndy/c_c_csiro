NVIDIA CUDA is introduced into the existing C/MPI framework, and we have given careful consideration to maintainability in addition to performance. Significant performance gains are realised on each GPU through restructuring of the data layout to allow memory coalescing and the adaptation of key loops to reduce off-chip memory accesses. The halo-swap communication phase has been designed to efficiently utilise many GPUs in parallel: included is the overlapping of several stages using CUDA stream functionality. The new GPU adaptation is seen to retain the good scaling behaviour of the original CPU code, and scales well up to 256 NVIDIA Fermi GPUs (the largest resource tested).
