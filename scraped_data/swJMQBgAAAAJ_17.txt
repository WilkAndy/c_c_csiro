The total P content of shoots from IHP-supplied plants grown in agar was between 20% and 34% of that for seedlings supplied with an equivalent amount of P as inorganic phosphate (Pi), while in sand-vermiculite, the total P content of IHP-grown plants was between 5 and 10% of control plants. The poor ability of plants to utilize P from IHP resulted in significantly lower tissue P concentrations and, in general, reduced plant dry weight accumulation. In contrast, the P nutrition of plants supplied with IHP was significantly improved by inoculating media with either a cultured \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16648949967486384248", "cites_id": ["16648949967486384248"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1004871704173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ePhGF8nzDOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 13, "2006": 9, "2007": 16, "2008": 9, "2009": 14, "2010": 17, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 19, "2014": 23, "2015": 14, "2016": 21, "2017": 15, "2018": 12, "2019": 17, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
