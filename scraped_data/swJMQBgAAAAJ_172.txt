Cultivation during the transition from pasture to crop leads to a loss of SOM, which may affect soil functionality and subsequent agricultural productivity. However, it is unclear how management practices influence SOM dynamics following this transition. We investigated the impact of initial soil fertility and application of lime and nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S)) on changes in soil carbon (C) during the transition from a permanent pasture to a crop. The pasture was managed over 20 years with fertiliser to generate soils with initial high and low fertility (referred to as P2 and P0, respectively), based on soil C, N, P and S concentrations. Prior to sowing, pasture residue was incorporated with three treatments applied: control, lime, and lime + nutrient.
