The species differ in their intrinsic growth rates, response to phosphorus (P) fertiliser application and critical external P requirements (P required for 90% maximum growth). The present study examined whether internal P-utilisation efficiency (PUE) by Rytidosperma species influenced these differences. The PUE of nine Rytidosperma species and two grasses of Mediterranean origin, Bromus hordeaceus L. and Lolium perenne L., was assessed using alternative measures of shoot P concentration or its reciprocal. No measure of PUE was correlated with the critical external P requirements of the species. One measure of PUE, shoot dry matter per unit P, when assessed at a common shoot P content was correlated with potential growth rate (P\u2009<\u20090.001; r\u2009=\u20090.93; 4\u2009mg shoot P). However, other measures of PUE were not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9993352451699906815", "cites_id": ["9993352451699906815"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BT/BT15202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_xjalhuFr4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3}}
