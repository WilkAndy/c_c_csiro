Recovery of P from waste streams (e.g., by producing fertiliser products from sewage sludge) is an important way to conserve scarce P resources. This study evaluated the P fertiliser and soil pH amendment values of a municipal sewage sludge ash (SA) for pasture growth on three acidic soils with contrasting P buffering and P sorption (\u201cfixation\u201d) characteristics. Growth of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) and incubation of the fertilisers with soil were used to compare the initial (following application) and residual (following incubation with soil) fertiliser values of SA with those of single superphosphate (SSP). Soil pHCa was increased linearly by application of SA. The lime-equivalent value of SA was\u2009~\u200933% (product weight basis). The initial P-fertiliser value of SSP was substantially greater than that of SA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16728699739520264509", "cites_id": ["16728699739520264509"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-022-10206-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PWlG2MdHKOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
