In this study we assessed differences in carbon (C) stability of pasture soils that had high and low C content (2.35% vs 1.73% whole soil C in the 0\u201310 cm layer) resulting from long-term phosphorus fertilisation. We used soil size fractionation (fine fraction, coarse fraction and winnowing) to assess the amount of stable C and indicators of microbial decomposition capacity (catabolic profiles, metabolic quotient) to assess C stability. As a main effect throughout the 60-cm profile, C concentrations were higher in the fine fraction soil in the high (excess P fertiliser; P2) than low (no P fertiliser; P0) treatments, demonstrating a larger stable C fraction. For both P2 and P0, there was a strong correlation between C measured in the fine fraction and winnowed fraction in the 0\u201330 cm layer (R = 0.985, P < 0.001 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3763022002688482097", "cites_id": ["3763022002688482097"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR19065", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mds5-JLwODQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
