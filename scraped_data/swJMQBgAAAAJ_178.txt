In this study, we investigated two P\u2010solubilisation approaches (acidification and P mobilisation by citrate) to enhance plant P uptake from the FB\u2010I ash in a pot study by using various biotic strategies: (1) a pre\u2010treatment of ash with a Penicillium bilaiae inoculum, (2) an isogenic line of wheat that excretes citrate from the root tip, (3) nitrogen (N) provided as   combined with nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD). All strategies were tested combined with each other and with different methods for ash application: (1) completely mixed within the top one third of soil in a pot, or (2) applied as distinct band at 10 cm depth. Triple super phosphate (TSP) at a rate of 15 mg P kg\u22121 soil per pot was sufficient to support maximum shoot growth.
