Because of their oligotrophic nature, archaea play an important role in biogeochemical processes in nutrient-limited Arctic soils. With the existing knowledge of high archaeal abundance and functional potential in Arctic soils, this study employed terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP) profiling and geostatistical analysis to explore spatial dependency and edaphic determinants of the overall archaeal (ARC) and ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) communities in a high Arctic polar oasis soil. ARC communities were spatially dependent at the 2\u20135 m scale (P < 0.05), whereas AOA communities were dependent at the \u223c1 m scale (P < 0.0001). Soil moisture, pH, and total carbon content were key edaphic factors driving both the ARC and AOA community structure. However, AOA evenness had simultaneous correlations with dissolved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16658038481596910470", "cites_id": ["16658038481596910470"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2015-0669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hgtfrr09LecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
