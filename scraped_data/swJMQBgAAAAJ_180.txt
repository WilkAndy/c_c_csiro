Key nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are required in relatively large amounts by plants. This article compares the soil microbial and chemical processes involved in converting unavailable sources of N and P into plant-available forms; contrasts the different origin of N and P inputs, their pathways of movement within soil to the root, and efficiencies in plant uptake and use; and considers the environmental implications of N and P losses from the plant\u2013soil system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4072634640859904890", "cites_id": ["4072634640859904890"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4072634640859904890&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ertnzKDnhDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
