There are many advantages using this philosophy. The recycled materials are free from landfill tax, waste disposal charges and aggregate levy tax. This chapter examines the engineering qualities of concrete incorporating by products and recycled aggregates (RA).Conclusions are drawn that support the use of RA. The RA can provide suitable strength for structural concrete and with careful mix design, the same concrete can produce equal freeze/thaw durability if suitably protected with air entrainment or Type 1 polypropylene fibres."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11760169096365510803", "cites_id": ["11760169096365510803"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780857096821500130", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k5BkL3yDNKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
