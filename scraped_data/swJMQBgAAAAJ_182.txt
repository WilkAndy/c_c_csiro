What is less readily understood is the use of Type 2 synthetic fibres to provide toughness. This problem is exacerbated by the wide range of synthetic fibres available, with each different fibre providing different structural/material properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6321311172215658579", "cites_id": ["6321311172215658579"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan-Richardson-4/publication/235306294_Synthetic_and_steel_fibres_in_concrete_with_regard_to_equal_toughness/links/5534e4180cf2ea51c1335340/Synthetic-and-steel-fibres-in-concrete-with-regard-to-equal-toughness", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U1if9gTPuVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
