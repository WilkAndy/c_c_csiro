Ornithopus sativus was included as a highly P\u2010efficient benchmark species. Plants were grown as microswards in pots with five rates of P supplied in a topsoil layer to mimic uneven P distribution within a field soil profile. Topsoil and subsoil roots were harvested separately to enable measurement of the nutrient\u2010foraging responses. Critical P requirement (lowest P supply for maximum yield) varied over a threefold range, reflecting differences in root morphology and acclimation of nutrient\u2010foraging roots to P stress. Among the species, there was a 3.2\u2010fold range in root length density, a 1.7\u2010fold range in specific root length, and a 2.1\u2010fold range in root hair length. O. sativus had the lowest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=827124678195846277", "cites_id": ["827124678195846277"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ppl.13500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hZzSNIOJegsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
