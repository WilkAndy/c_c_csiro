This work expands upon the earlier data collection by introducing a bye product (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement. The test methodology allows comparisons to be drawn between fibre and non fibre concretes with and without GGBS."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14362566389630328113", "cites_id": ["14362566389630328113"], "pub_url": "http://www.claisse.info/2010%20papers/l64.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MV3hBAkWUscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
