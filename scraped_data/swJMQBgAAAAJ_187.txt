The study focuses upon the quality of the concrete in the cover zone and the cover zones effect upon overall permeability and sorptivity of the concrete. In conjunction to the above, there is an examination of the transport mechanisms available to move water through the concrete matrix and how the transport mechanisms are influenced by the additions of polypropylene fibres. It was found the effect of fibres in the early plastic stages of concrete manufacture have the effect of reducing water demand, reducing bleed water, therefore increasing cement hydration and increasing the ability of the concrete to hold the aggregates together, thus reducing slump. Examinations of the many transport mechanisms show polypropylene fibres have positive effects to reduce water absorption and ion migration. The overall effect is one of enhanced durability compared to that of concrete without a polypropylene fibre addition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2341601082748296136", "cites_id": ["2341601082748296136"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/65902", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yNvhRscJfyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2}}
