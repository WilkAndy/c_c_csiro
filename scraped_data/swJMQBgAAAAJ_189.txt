Previous work [Richardson 2005] has shown monofilament fibres to be instrumental in maintaining the integrity of early life concrete when subject to freeze/thaw cycles. This work expands upon the earlier data collection by introducing a bye product (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement. The test methodology allows comparisons to be drawn between fibre and non fibre concretes with and without GGBS. Concrete cubes cured to four days were subjected to a maximum of 50 freeze/thaw cycles. It was found that there was a clear association with the use of monofilament fibres in concrete with regard to enhanced durability qualities, when compared to plain PC concrete and concrete mixes with partial GGBS cement replacement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17616903036136559331", "cites_id": ["17616903036136559331"], "pub_url": "https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/491/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:45JrF_nPe_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
