Two A. niger phytase preparations were used: (1) a purified form which exhibited a narrow substrate specificity and high specific activity against phytate; and (2) a commercial preparation (Sigma) with activity against a broad range of P compounds. A comparatively large proportion (up to 79%, or 5.7\u2009\u03bcg g\u20131 soil) of the organic P (Po) extracted with citric acid was hydrolysed by the commercial phytase, while between 28% and 40% (up to 3.1\u2009\u03bcg g\u20131 soil) was hydrolysed using purified phytase. By comparison, only small quantities of the Po in water and NaHCO3 soil extracts were enzyme labile. While extractable Po was increased both with increasing concentrations of citric acid (up to 50\u2009mM) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 252, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15074671296657389736", "cites_id": ["15074671296657389736"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003740000249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qHgK36z9M9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 11, "2005": 8, "2006": 17, "2007": 12, "2008": 12, "2009": 13, "2010": 12, "2011": 11, "2012": 10, "2013": 20, "2014": 14, "2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
