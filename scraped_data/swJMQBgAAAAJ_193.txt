The efficacy of a three compartment model of inorganic P (Pi) in the soil (soil solution, readily-exchangeable and \u201cfixed\u201d Pi) to predict plant-available Pi was examined for use in a computer-based simulation tool (NutriAce) being developed to assist graziers making fertiliser investment decisions. Predictions of plant-available Pi explained 80% of the variation in soil test values."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2622699043669627883", "cites_id": ["2622699043669627883"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47624-X_436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:61OvcuKyZSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
