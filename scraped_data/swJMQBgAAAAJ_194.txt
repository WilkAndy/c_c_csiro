To investigate this, a litter decomposition experiment was established using a reciprocal design (litter type x dominant overstory genus) in Acacia and Eucalyptus revegetation shelterbelts on a common soil to assess rates of decomposition and C degradation associated with differences in enzyme activities and microbial communities. Litter bags with two mesh sizes were used to either exclude (<2 mm) or allow access (>2 mm) by soil macrofauna. Bags were filled with either Eucalyptus, Acacia or an equal mix of Acacia and Eucalyptus litter. Decomposition, enzyme activities and bacterial and fungal community profiles were determined following recovery of surface-placed bags at 40 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5808988582166078076", "cites_id": ["5808988582166078076"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031405620300913", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fCJPkFasnVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
