Previous research has focused on assessing either the impact of nutrients on C associated with specific soil fractions or the application of lime on C dynamics in the whole soil, without fully considering the potential interactions of lime and nutrients on changes in soil C. A short-term (77 days) incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of lime and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) when added with 13 C-labeled wheat straw on the incorporation of the wheat straw C into soil C. Respiration was measured throughout the incubation, and soil (a Yellow Chromosol or acidic Alfisol) was analyzed for C in the fine (< 0.4 mm) and coarse (> 0.4 mm) soil fractions after 77 days. There was greater C loss from the coarse fraction soil across all treatments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17537613924651816912", "cites_id": ["17537613924651816912"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/FullText/2019/04000/Lime_and_Nutrient_Addition_Affects_the_Dynamics.2.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0NfQOvIeYvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
