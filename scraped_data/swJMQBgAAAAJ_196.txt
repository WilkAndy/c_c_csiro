Total shoot dry mass of microswards of clover interplanted with lupin was significantly higher in P-deficient soil, compared to clover monocultures. The benefit to P-efficiency was greater when there was more lupin growing in the mixture. However, the clover component of the sward was depressed by the lupin. In a second experiment, subterranean clover and white lupin were interplanted with their shoots physically separated to assess whether mobilisation of P by the lupin directly improved the P nutrition of the interplanted clover. However, the shoot dry matter and P uptake by subterranean clover were generally lower when grown in interplanted treatments, compared with growth and P uptake in clover monocultures. This suggested that interplanted lupins had not \u201cfacilitated\u201d improved P acquisition by the clover; instead the improved yield of mixed swards in low-P soil was more likely the result of \u201ccomplementarity\u201d or \u201cniche differentiation\u201d, with the companion species exploring different soil horizons and/or different soil P resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1545782316529593195", "cites_id": ["1545782316529593195"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2017/199_ASA2017_Becquer_Adeline_Final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a6vTtNO4cxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2}}
