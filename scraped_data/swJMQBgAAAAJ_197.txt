Durability is defined within Eurocode 2 (2006), which states: 'A durable structure shall meet the requirements of serviceability, strength and stability throughout its intended working life, without significant loss of utility or excessive maintenance.' The satisfactory durability of CEM 1 (Portland cement) concrete, with or without additives, is a major reason why it is the world's most widely used construction material. Areas of concern that will adversely affect the durabiltiy of concrete are material limitations; design and construction practices; and severe exposure conditions that can cause concrete to deteriorate, which may result in aesthetic, functional or structural problems. Concrete can deteriorate for a variety of reasons, and concrete damage is often the result of a combination of factors, starting with the initiation of cracks which lead to processes that involve deleterious chemical reactions and hydrostatic breakdown, The rate of crack propagation is controlled by ionic/molecular transport systems, producing microstructural changes degrading the physical properties of the concrete. Concrete is subject to deterioration caused by the absorption of moisture and thermal expansion and contraction. Extreme temperature ranges of both hot and cold can cause spalling. Moisture absorbed by the concrete expands and contracts with temperature changes, and the resulting mechanical action can cause fractures and spalling.
