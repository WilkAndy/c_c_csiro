Plain and finned concrete slabs were manufactured from concrete with a 100% - PC binder (CEM 1) and a binder using 50% - PC and 50% GGBS (CEM 111). The slabs were subject to mainly radiative heat for a 7.5 hour daytime period and left to cool for 16.5 hours. Comparative readings were taken to measure the temperature difference between the two types of concrete during heating and cooling. The findings showed concrete manufactured with GGBS had a lower heat build up and release when compared to concrete manufactured with 100% CEM 1 binder. The research was limited to one comparative test at a single concrete strength with a single water cement ratio, and 50% GGBS cement replacement. Various GGBS cement replacement percentages could be tried to evaluate heat build up and release. Further research on U and Y values are also worthy of further investigation. Thermal mass could be improved thus reducing the need to use energy intensive air conditioning systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16028432472948847917", "cites_id": ["16028432472948847917"], "pub_url": "https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/2389/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LbVzcGlucN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2}}
