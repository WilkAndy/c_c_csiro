Understanding the microbial contribution to plant P nutrition and opportunities for manipulating specific microorganisms to enhance P availability in soil has therefore been of considerable interest over many decades. This interest is accentuated by P deficiency being common in weathered and tropical soils throughout the world, by rising costs of P fertilizer, and because the efficiency of P use by plants from soil and fertilizer sources is often poor despite many soils containing a relatively large amount of total P that is only sparingly available to plants. The world\u2019s high-quality sources of rock phosphate are finite and this itself justifies the need to develop plants and/or agricultural systems that are more P efficient.
