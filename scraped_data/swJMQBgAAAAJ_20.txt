In particular, the importance of rhizosphere phosphatase activity and its role in hydrolysing organic phosphorus in soil is considered. The bioavailability and utilization of organic phosphorus by plants as well as in the soil are also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 241, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8575345115887014940", "cites_id": ["8575345115887014940"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9780851998220.0165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HJTT4vK-AXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 11, "2009": 13, "2010": 12, "2011": 16, "2012": 15, "2013": 27, "2014": 13, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 23, "2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
