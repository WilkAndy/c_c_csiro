Myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) constitutes the majority of identified organic P in many soil types and is poorly available to plants. Incorporating phytase-producing biofertilizers into soil presents a viable and environmentally acceptable way of utilizing P from phytate, while reducing the need for mineral P application. A deeper understanding of the microbial ecology in relation to degradation of phytate under natural soil conditions is however needed to obtain successful biofertilizer candidates able to compete in complex soil environments. Here we present the development of a microcosm for studying microbial communities able to colonize and utilize Ca-phytate hotspots in solum. Our results provide evidence that the recruited microbial population mineralizes Ca \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11285298783861998873", "cites_id": ["11285298783861998873"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42832-021-0089-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GQU-rHNvnZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
