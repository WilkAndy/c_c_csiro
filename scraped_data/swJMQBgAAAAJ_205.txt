The C:N ratio of the gravel-associated OM was similar to that in fine earth fraction (FEF) soil, with C:N ratio of \u223c13 in surface layers to \u223c8 at depth.Conclusions We estimated that 19% and 23% of the total stock of C and N, respectively, were associated with gravel over the whole soil profile.
