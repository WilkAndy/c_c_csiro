This biological nitrification inhibition(BNI) capacity can decrease N loss and increase N uptake from the rhizosphere. This study sought evidence for the existence and magnitude of BNI capacity in canola (Brassica napus). Seedlings of three canola cultivars, Brachiaria humidicola (BNI positive) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) were grown in a hydroponic system. Root exudates were collected and their inhibition of the ammonia oxidizing"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5097532366296445702", "cites_id": ["5097532366296445702"], "pub_url": "https://journal.hep.com.cn/fase/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=30464", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
