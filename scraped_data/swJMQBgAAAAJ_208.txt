However, there are increasing environmental, economic and strategic issues associated with using P, which is a nonrenewable and \u201ceffectively finite\u201d global resource. We review the P balance of temperate pastures to identify the factors that contribute to inefficient P use and discuss ways to improve P use efficiency. The most immediate gains can be made by ensuring that pastures are not over-fertilised. Plants with low critical P requirements, particularly as a result of better root foraging, will be important. Root traits such as fine roots (root diameter), branching, length and root hairs, and mycorrhizal associations all contribute to improved root foraging; some are amenable to plant breeding. Plants that can \u201cmine\u201d sparingly-available P in soils by producing organic anions and phosphatases are also needed; as are innovations in fertiliser technology. Soil microorganisms play a crucial role in P acquisition by pastures but are not particularly amenable to management. Selection of pasture species for root characteristics offers a more realistic approach to improving P efficiency but progress, to date, has been minimal. Traditional plant breeding, augmented by marker assisted selection and interspecific hybridisation, are likely to be necessary for progress. Inevitably, P efficient pastures will be achieved most effectively by a combination of plant genetic, fertiliser innovation and management responses. Success will bring economic and environmental benefits from reduced P fertiliser use, with consequent benefits for global resource and food security."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10460823090114572800", "cites_id": ["10460823090114572800"], "pub_url": "https://uknowledge.uky.edu/igc/22/2-11/2/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ALJ7OC1PLJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
