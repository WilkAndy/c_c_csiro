In this study an agricultural site with consistent long term (+20years) treatments and a non-agricultural site (grassland) were investigated to determine land-use effects on soil microbial community structure and function. We used a variety of methods to investigate microbial community structure, biomass, potential and actual function and soil physicochemical properties. All soils showed similar levels of bacterial diversity although community structure (bacterial, archaeal, fungal) differed under all treatments. Overall, our results indicate that despite evident differences in microbial community structure among all soils examined, there was little functional difference among soils under cultivation in the various cropping treatments. There were, however, clear differences in both function and structure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7748721430198427615", "cites_id": ["7748721430198427615"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139311001922", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3x9vFhb9iGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 14, "2014": 16, "2015": 23, "2016": 18, "2017": 21, "2018": 14, "2019": 24, "2020": 20, "2021": 25, "2022": 32, "2023": 6}}
