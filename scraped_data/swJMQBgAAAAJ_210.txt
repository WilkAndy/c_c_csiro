We investigated the concentrations of Colwell extractable P in the surface soil (0-10 cm) of a red kandosol (pHCaCl2 4.42) within the planting row of a wheat crop sown on 31 May 2011 at Condobolin, NSW. Triple superphosphate had been banded at 0, 4, 8 or 20 kg P/ha with the wheat seed which was sown at 4.5 cm depth. The aim was to quantify the temporal mismatch between P availability in the band and the critical P requirement (Colwell P concentration corresponding to 95% of maximum growth rate) of the crop. The critical Colwell P concentration of topsoil in the crop row was initially low, but increased during tillering and was~ 54 mg P/kg during grain filling. To achieve this concentration of Colwell P after anthesis it was necessary to apply~ 15.3 kg P/ha at sowing. It was estimated that this would initially generate a Colwell P concentration of 80-90 mg P/kg and it was concluded that the Colwell P concentration of topsoil in the crop row (ie soil associated with the fertiliser band) would remain above the critical requirement of the crop for the first 126 days (~ 70%) of the crop\u2019s growth period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14740673021212627211", "cites_id": ["14740673021212627211"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2012/8303_4_culvenor.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CxGQawNkkcwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
