Paired comparison tests were carried out to compare density, strength, pulse velocity, and absorption using plain and fibre concrete at ambient UK indoor temperatures, compared to concrete at elevated temperatures that would be found in The Middle East.   The results show that both plain and fibre concrete were subject to poor internal curing which created an open pore structure that led to high absorption rates. Polypropylene fibres do not have a significant effect in providing optimum curing conditions when subject to elevated temperatures, however they performed better than plain concrete."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6231651127577623914", "cites_id": ["6231651127577623914"], "pub_url": "https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/5709/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aj1tD69Fe1YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
