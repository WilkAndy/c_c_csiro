Root and shoot growth of acid-soil resistant (cv. Advanced AT) and sensitive (cv. Sirosa) phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) were compared during establishment at a field site with an acid and aluminium toxic subsoil (pHCaCl2 3.9; Al 25 mg kg-1 CaCl2 extractable). At 6 weeks after planting, the phalaris genotypes did not differ in plant density, shoot dry matter per plant or root mass to a depth of 0.1 m. However, 10 months after planting, ground coverage and shoot dry matter yield of Sirosa were only 73% and 51% of that of Advanced AT, respectively. Roots were sampled at 0.1 m increments to a depth of 0.6 m and were washed from soil for dry matter determination. Root DNA was also extracted directly from intact soil cores and quantified using real-time PCR. Advanced AT had significantly greater root growth in the acid subsoil than Sirosa as shown by either root mass or root DNA content of soil cores. However, when converted to root mass (based on calibration samples), the DNA assays indicated a larger mass of roots than was measured after root washing. The cause of this difference is presently unknown. Better root development by Advanced AT was associated with improved plant persistence and dry matter production. Results from glasshouse studies indicate that differences in root growth between the genotypes are likely to be due mainly to differences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8651901659413990064", "cites_id": ["8651901659413990064"], "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2010/pastures-forage/physiology-breeding/7148_halingre.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sMr7MLi6EXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
