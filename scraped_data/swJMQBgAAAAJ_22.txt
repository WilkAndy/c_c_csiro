Using agroforestry systems as a model, this study examined the effects of land uses and edaphic properties on bacterial communities in three agroforestry types covering a 270\u2009km soil\u2010climate gradient in Alberta, Canada. Our results demonstrate that land\u2010use patterns exert stronger effects on soil bacterial communities than soil zones in these agroforestry systems. Plots with trees in agroforestry systems promoted greater bacterial abundance and to some extent species richness, which was associated with more nutrient\u2010rich soil resources. While Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla and subphyla across land uses, Arthrobacter, Acidobacteria_Gp16, Burkholderia, Rhodanobacter and R \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 196, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7993572527844911089", "cites_id": ["7993572527844911089"], "pub_url": "https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.12986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8WeEwNzf7m4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 12, "2018": 17, "2019": 23, "2020": 27, "2021": 49, "2022": 45, "2023": 16}}
