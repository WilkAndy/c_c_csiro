Soil C and N stocks were monitored for a further 3 years (to 2015) with supplementary nutrients maintained, and then for 5 years after they were ceased (2015\u20132020). The increase in FF-C established in the first phase of nutrient addition (9.6 Mg C ha\u22121) was maintained during the ongoing 3 year period of nutrient addition (9.8 Mg C ha\u22121) but declined to 3.0 Mg C ha\u22121 during the subsequent 5 years when nutrient addition ceased. The decline in FF-C stocks was attributed to both less formation of FF-C without the supplementary nutrients applied, and to nutrient mining as insufficient N was being applied to both treatments to fully satisfy the N removed in crops.
