Air lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca (OH) 2) is a binder that has attracted considerable attention for its ability to capture CO 2 from the atmosphere, its low-cost and low-energy production process. Furthermore, Ca (OH) 2 is an important phase of hydrated Portland cements, and lime-based mortars have shown high elasticity and the ability of self-healing. The performance of lime-based building materials can be enhanced by the addition of organic compounds that can modify the mineralogy and microstructure of Ca (OH) 2. In this study, the effects of four biopolymers including starch, inulin, pectin, and calcium lignosulfonate, on the microstructure and mineralogy of lime have been investigated. Hydrated lime was produced by slaking quicklime in water. Two sets of hydrated lime batches were produced for each polymer:(i) the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.scientific.net/CTA.1.353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YOjsRgzw8nQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
