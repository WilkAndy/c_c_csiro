Myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) and its lower order derivatives constitute the majority of identified organic P in many soil types and has been shown to accumulate with increasing application of P fertilizer. Phytate is only poorly available to plants, and in alkaline soils it often precipitated as even more unavailable calcium (Ca)-phytate. Incorporating phytase-producing biofertilizers (i.e., microbial-based products with capacity to mineralize phytate) into soil presents a viable and environmentally acceptable way of utilizing P from phytate, whilst reducing the need for mineral P application. Here we present an in-soil microcosm that utilizes precipitated Ca-phytate to recruit microorganisms with degradation activity towards phytate in solum. Our results show both direct and indirect evidence for Ca-phytate mineralization in vitro and in solum. Furthermore, the abundance of bacteria recruited was measured via 16S rRNA gene copy number, as was three genes relating to organic P degradation; phoX and phoD phosphatases and the BPP (\u03b2-propeller phytase) gene. Amplicon sequencing as well as BioLog catabolism studies show that microcosm treatments containing the \u2018bait\u2019 Ca-phytate, recruited a different set of microorganisms when compared to controls. These Ca-phytate microcosms recruited mainly Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, and the genus Streptomyces was specifically enriched. We conclude that our microcosm presents an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.03.274811.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GZAJXSPmhlYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
