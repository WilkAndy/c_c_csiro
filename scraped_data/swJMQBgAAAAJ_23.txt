Phytase activity from roots of phosphorus- (P-)-deficient Trifolium subterraneum L. was characterised. Activity was enhanced by 40% when extracts were passed through Sephadex G-25, and increased by a further 20\u201330% with the addition of either 1 m\u041c EDTA or 5 m\u041c cysteine to assay solutions. The optimum temperature for phytase activity was 50\u00b0C and the optimum pH was 5.3. When compared with phosphatase activity measured in the roots of T. subterraneum, phytase activity exhibited narrower pH and temperature optima, and was also more strongly inhibited by Co2+, Zn2+ and AsO42\u2212 ions. Significantly, for the five pasture species examined, phytase activity was less than 5% of the total acid phosphatase activity in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 194, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8220927246063754202", "cites_id": ["8220927246063754202"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/pp99065", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2tv1IcaZFnIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 12, "2006": 5, "2007": 8, "2008": 14, "2009": 11, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
