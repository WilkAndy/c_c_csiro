Adding P fertiliser can overcome this limitation but the balance efficiency of the fertiliser, ie the proportion of fertiliser P that is exported from the paddock in produce in the year of application, is generally low (eg< 20%). The objective of this project was to investigate the causes of this low efficiency. Field trials using superphosphate containing a radioactive label indicated relatively high (30-60%) P use efficiency of pasture species (ie the proportion of fertiliser P that is taken up by plants). Analysis of soils from long-term field experiments showed that over longer timescales P accumulates in both inorganic and organic forms, with much of the organic P accumulating in these soils apparently produced by a previously unrecognised process. Together these results indicate that an important contributor to low P balance efficiency in grazed pastures are reactions occurring over longer time scales sequestering some of the P cycling in the soil-plant-animal system. Incorporation of this knowledge into fertiliser P management and the selection and breeding of pasture plants holds much promise for reducing P fertiliser requirements in the red meat industry."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mla.com.au/contentassets/75d0b5e191b84496a98baa52322e44b5/b.pue.0102_final_report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uMjEZojB9aYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
