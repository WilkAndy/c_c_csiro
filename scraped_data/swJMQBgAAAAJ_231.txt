Conference Proceedings", "pages": "322-325", "publisher": "Australian Society of Agronomy Inc", "abstract": "The application of single superphosphate (SSP) to leguminous pastures is a successful strategy for pasture production in the high rainfall zone of eastern Australia. Typically, the management of fertiliser phosphorus (P) in these grazing systems involves the addition of SSP to the soil surface early in the growing season. However, it is not known whether this is the \u2018best\u2019strategy for achieving maximum pasture growth with high fertiliser P efficiency. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of different fertiliser P management strategies on clover growth and fertiliser P efficiency. This involved using 33P-labelled SSP to measure the direct recovery of fertiliser P in shoots of a subterranean clover pasture at two field sites and under different management conditions (including timing, placement and initial soil P fertility). In general, maximum clover growth and recovery of fertiliser P by clover plants was obtained when fertiliser P was applied to the soil surface early in the growing season. In addition, the recovery of fertiliser P by clover shoots was highest (46% of applied P) in fields that were maintained with soil test P levels near the optimum for pasture growth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2015_Conference/pdf/agronomy2015final00350.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oPKH5ESDspUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
