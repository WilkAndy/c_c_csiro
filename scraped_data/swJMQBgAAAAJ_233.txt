However, the fertilizer P use efficiency (PUE) in pasture systems is low and will need to significantly improve for agricultural and environmental reasons. The cause of low PUE in pastures is most often associated with the accumulation of P in fertilized soil as sparinglyavailable forms of orthophosphate and organic P. The processes associated with poor PUE can be elucidated from an understanding of the major soil P forms that accumulate under P fertilization in pasture soils. The aim of this study was to identify which soil P forms accumulate in a long-term P-fertilized, grazing experiment under permanent pasture. The experiment was established in 1994 near Hall, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The experiment was established on a Yellow Chromosol soil in a degraded grass/clover pasture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE02445241", "cites_per_year": {}}
