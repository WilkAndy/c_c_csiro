The purpose of this paper is to improve existing structural performance or to return the original design performance, during refurbishment. The research aims to investigate the potential for enhanced flexural strength and toughness in concrete beams, which may be required for change of use of buildings, where loadings may be subject to change. Buildings in earthquake zones may also benefit from additional toughness provided with external fabric/yarn reinforcement as a means of providing additional time for escape, for the occupants.The test compared four types of concrete beams with different reinforcement material compositions and each set consisted of three beams. The beams were: plain reinforced concrete without any \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630801211228752/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SVhRfb3GIvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
