We used a quantitative DNA-based technique to investigate root growth of acid-soil resistant (eg, weeping grass and selections of phalaris) and sensitive genotypes (eg, tall wheat grass) of perennial grasses directly in an acidic field soil. DNA was extracted from large samples of soil (~ 500 g) taken from different soil profile regions and quantified by real time-PCR using species-specific primers and probes. A range of factors, including plant species, root type and plant age were previously shown to influence the DNA content of roots (Haling et al. 2011). Therefore, it was necessary to account for this with specific calibrations for each species and soil depth when converting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP112569&sb=RECENT&n=6&rpp=25&page=34&tr=5040&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
