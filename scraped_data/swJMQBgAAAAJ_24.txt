Agar (pH 5.0) had a low IHP-sorbing capacity while IHP was almost completely sorbed in sand-vermiculite. Pi and G1P were relatively available in both media. Growth of each species was measured in relation to phosphorus (P) supply and levels of Pi supply at which shoot yields reached 90% of maximum yield (Pcrit) were determined. Pcrit values were generally higher for the legume species than for the grasses, and were six-fold higher for Trifolium subterraneum L. seedlings when grown in sand-vermiculite relative to agar. When supplied with G1P, seedlings of the six species grew as well as plants supplied with Pi. By contrast, IHP was a poor source of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7625896020318613361", "cites_id": ["7625896020318613361"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1004782324030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ce8n2Qag1GkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 7, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 12, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 10, "2011": 6, "2012": 12, "2013": 14, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 16, "2017": 13, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
