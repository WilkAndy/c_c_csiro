This issue represents the start of a new era, as it is the first since the new School was formed on the 1st September 2010. We would like to take this opportunity to greet our new colleagues, who we anticipate will greatly enhance the research profile of the School, as well as providing a range of interesting and thoughtprovoking journal submissions. The journal\u2019s name has been altered to reflect the change, and will now be known as Built and Natural Environment Research Papers. Dr Emine Mine Thompson continues in the role of Editor-in-Chief, assisted by two Associate Editors, Dr Paul Greenhalgh and Gill Davidson. We welcome input from all of our colleagues in the School; we are particularly keen to hear from new colleagues who would be willing to become Editorial Board members, so that we can ensure that the Board\u2013and the journal\u2013continues to fully reflect the broad scope of subject interests the School encompasses. All papers printed in the journal are subject to a rigorous peer-review process.The aim of the journal is to recognise and celebrate the range of quality research that is produced within the School, giving early career researchers the chance to gain writing experience, showcasing the best of our students\u2019 work, sharing ideas and allowing the publication of interim findings. We publish the following types of work: early and interim findings from ongoing research; literature reviews and scoping studies; and high quality student research projects and dissertations, including award-winning work."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ziouziou.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Strategic_Considerations_for_Construction_in_the_PR_of_China.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
