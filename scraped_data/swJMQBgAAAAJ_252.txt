If a medium dose of accelerator was found to be effective, the cost/bene\ufb01t would be substantial as well as being low risk with regard to additive additions in concrete.Designfrnethoclologyfapproach\u2014Comparative examination of plain concrete, and concrete with a non-chloride accelerator additive was carried out, using the compressive strength to establish strength gain at various time intervals between one and 28 days. The additive dose was less than half of the maximum recommended to avoid the strength loss problems associated with the use of accelerating admixtures due to possible overheating."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/566/1/Richardson%20-%20strength%20development%20of%20plain%20concrete%20compared%20to....article.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2GWQ5-otU_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
