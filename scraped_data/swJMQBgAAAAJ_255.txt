The bioavailability of inositol phosphates depends on their mineralization by extracellular phytases. However, we currently have a poor understanding of the interactions between phytases and inositol phosphates in the rhizosphere. Transgenic plants which exude phytase to the rhizosphere allow us to directly manipulate rhizosphere biochemistry and have potential to elucidate mechanisms of organic P turnover inconceivable with other less strictly controlled experimental material. With phytate as the sole P source in agar, transgenic T. subterraneum exhibited significantly improved growth and P accumulation (2.9-fold increased shoot P content) compared to controls. This was attributed to a 77-fold increase in phytase activity exuded to the rhizosphere. However, when grown in soil these unique characteristics were compromised. In that, transgenic T. subterraneum had only 1.2-fold greater P accumulation than controls. In contrast, transgenic N. tabacum accumulated up to 1.5-fold more P than controls, but only in soils amended with inositol phosphate. In unamended soils all plants depleted phytate (phytase-labile P), which was determined by its lability to a non-specific phytase (Sigma-Aldrich). Over the growth period 60% of phytase-labile P was depleted from a low P-sorption rhizosphere soil, while only 15% disappeared from moderate P-sorption rhizosphere soils. Transgenic plants were more effective, depleting 80% of phytase-labile P, but only in the low P-sorption soils. This suggests that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://crops.confex.com/crops/wc2006/techprogram/P11920.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
