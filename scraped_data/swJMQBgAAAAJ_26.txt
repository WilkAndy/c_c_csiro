These changes have been linked to a reduction in plant biomass as ecosystems age, but the implications for belowground organisms remain unknown.We constructed a phosphorus budget for the well-studied 120,000 year temperate rainforest chronosequence at Franz Josef, New Zealand. The budget included the amounts of phosphorus in plant biomass, soil microbial biomass, and other soil pools.Soil microbes contained 68\u201378 % of the total biomass phosphorus (i.e. plant plus microbial) for the majority of the 120,000 year chronosequence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11027359021666902280", "cites_id": ["11027359021666902280"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-012-1493-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CKEn0ZoMCZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 17, "2016": 19, "2017": 16, "2018": 17, "2019": 21, "2020": 23, "2021": 19, "2022": 30, "2023": 8}}
