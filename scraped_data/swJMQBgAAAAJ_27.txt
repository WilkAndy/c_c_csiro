These constraints are commonly overcome in agriculture by applying fertilizers to improve yields. However, excessive anthropogenic N and P inputs impact natural environments and have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences, from individual species up to entire ecosystems. The extent to which global N and P cycles have been perturbed over the past century can be seen as a global fertilization experiment with significant redistribution of nutrients across different ecosystems. Here we explore the effects of N and P availability on stoichiometry and genomic traits of organisms, which, in turn, can influence: (i) plant and animal abundances; (ii) trophic interactions and population dynamics; and (iii) ecosystem dynamics and productivity of agricultural crops. We articulate research priorities for a deeper understanding of how bioavailable N and P move through the environment and exert their ultimate impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 181, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11312051335358129945", "cites_id": ["11312051335358129945"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2017.00070/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GScBdcF6_JwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 14, "2020": 27, "2021": 56, "2022": 62, "2023": 14}}
