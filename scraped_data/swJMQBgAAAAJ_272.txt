These compounds are rarely detected elsewhere in nature and remain poorly understood, partly because conventional procedures for their determination are lengthy and erroneous. We report a straightforward procedure for the determination of scylloinositol phosphates in soil extracts using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Solution 31P NMR chemical shifts of a range of synthetic scyllo-inositot phosphate esters were determined in alkaline solution. Of these, only the signal corresponding to scylloinositol hexakisphosphate at approximately 4.2 ppm was identified in soil NaOH-EDTA extracts, constituting between 6.5 and 9.8% of the NaOH-EDTA extracted P. This signal has been previously assigned to choline phosphate, but we confirmed it to be an inositol phosphate using hypobromite oxidation, a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18319971088265909044&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
