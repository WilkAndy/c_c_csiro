The relationship was similar in years with moist spring conditions (1999 and 2000). However, the P concentrations of clover herbage were low and deficient when the topsoil was dry (2001), irrespective of soil P fertility. Critical herbage P concentrations of 0.32-0.34% of DM (YOL) or 0.27-0.30%(WS) were required to predict the expected critical soil P concentration (20-25 mg P/kg) using 1999-2000 data. However, when conditions other than P-deficiency also constrained plant growth (eg. dry topsoil), paired tests were not an appropriate way to predict the critical soil test value."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2003/c/14/simpson.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hoI6bjGsyYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
