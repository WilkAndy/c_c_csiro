Initial studies have shown that barley contains at least eight homologous genes. The promoters of six of these genes were analysed for the presence of regulatory elements potentially associated with expression specificity. In particular, the P1BS\u2010like elements (implicated in phosphorus\u2010regulated expression of genes in plants) was identified in all HvPht1 promoters examined. For two members of the family (HvPht1;1 and HvPht1;2), promoter fusions to \u03b2\u2010glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein reporter genes were constructed, transformed into rice, and the expression profiles observed. The inclusion of an intron derived from Adh1 enhanced gene expression approximately 20\u2010fold, but did not appear to affect the specificity of expression.
