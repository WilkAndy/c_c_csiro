Although soils generally contain a large amount of total soil phosphorus (P), only a small proportion is readily available to plants. P-based fertilizers are therefore used routinely to overcome P-deficiency which, for most soils, results in a further accumulation of total P. Numerous factors affect the availability of P in soil, with root structural characteristics and biological processes that occur at the root surface being most important. In particular, the release of exudates from roots and interactions of roots with soil microorganisms can improve a plant's capacity to obtain P. 1hese processes are amenable to manipulation and this paper summarises the potential for manipulating biological processes to improve the utilization of soil P by plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/ielapa.200302231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YVNMhmGGcgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
