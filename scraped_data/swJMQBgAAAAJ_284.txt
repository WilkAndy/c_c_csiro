We are assessing the feasibility to increase organic acid efflux (citrate) from roots by transforming plants with a gene coding for citrate synthase (CS). Preliminary analysis of tobacco transformed with its endogenous mitochondrial CS gene under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter shows up to a 2.5 fold higher CS activity than wildtype (wt) but similar internal citrate concentrations in roots and shoots."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47624-X_13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tEMggGOad6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
