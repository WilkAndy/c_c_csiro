More particularly, the present invention provides a method of increasing plant productivity comprising expressing in the root of a plant an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a phytase polypeptide for a time and under conditions sufficient for said phytase to be secreted from the root. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the chemistry of the soil around the root is modified by the application of an organic acid. The invention also provides novel phytase-encoding genes; genetic constructs which are useful for performing the inventive method; and transgenic plants produced therewith having improved productivity compared to their otherwise isogenic counterparts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU2019100121", "cites_per_year": {}}
