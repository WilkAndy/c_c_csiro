Acid phosphomonoesterase (\" phosphatase') activity of root segments was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. When plant growth was P-limited, elevated CO2 concentrations increased phosphatase activity more than at ambient CO2. This result (1) was evident when expressed on a unit root dry weight or root length basis, indicating that increased root enzyme activity was unlikely to be associated with CO2-induced changes in root morphology;(2) occurred when plants were grown aseptically, indicating that the increase in phosphatase activity originated from root cells rather than rootassociated microorganisms;(3) was associated with shoot P concentrations below 0.18%;(4) occurred only when wheat roots were grown under P deficiency but not when a transient P deficiency was imposed; and (5) suggest that a previously reported increase in phosphatase activity at elevated Co, by an Australian native pasture grass (Gifford, Lutze and Barrett 1996; Plant and Soil 187, 369-387) was also a root mediated response.
