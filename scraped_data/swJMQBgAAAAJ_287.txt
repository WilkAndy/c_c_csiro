Which sources of aggregate minerals are used in the future is an issue of the deepest interest to quarrying companies, the construction industry, people concerned with the environment, and decision makers within the planning system. In the UK, the role of the Department of the Environment (DoE) in aggregates planning is:(1) legislation, which governs the system and its operation;(2) specific decisions on issues for the Secretary of State for the Environment to decide; and (3) guidance on government policy for those operating the system. The newly revised MPG1, published in June 1996, presents the general principles of minerals planning, updates earlier guidance, and explains more fully how to incorporate sustainable development principles. MPG6 analyses trends in the consumption of aggregates and in their use, and considers the available supply options. Several ongoing activities support the implementation of its policies, and respond to some of the issues that it identifies. Planning is now firmly based on sustainable development, but there is much scope to discuss and develop the practical applications of its principles and their relevance to different forms of mineral working."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/482684", "cites_per_year": {}}
