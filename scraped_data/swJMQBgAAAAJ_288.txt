Trials cur-rently in progress at sites throughout Australia will help to determine the value of herbicide-resistant crops and pastures as part of weed management practices and pro-vide an assessment of the risks associated with the intro-duction of this technology. Transgenic cotton, lupins, peas, wheat and subterranean clover carrying genes conferring herbicide tolerance are being evaluated under field conditions, though it is not expected that these trials will all lead to the commercialization of herbicide-resist-ant crops. In some cases, eg wheat, herbicide tolerance has been used to demonstrate that stable transformation of the target species has been achieved. Commercializa-tion will ultimately depend on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks of the technology and the value of herbicide-resistance as part of an overall strategy for weed management.Resistance may be introduced into crop plants in three ways. Firstly, resistance may be identified in natural or mutagenised populations and the resulting germplasm used in breeding programs. For example, the development of brassicas with resistance to triazine her-bicides was accomplished by traditional breeding using resistance sourced from a weedy Brassica biotype (Beversdorf et al. 1988). Secondly, cell/tissue culture techniques may be used to identify genetic material carrying natural resistance to a particular herbicide and in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10605723592766970887&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B9zahGoZL5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
