Trials currently in progress at sites throughout Australia will help to determine the value of herbicide-resistant crops and pastures as part of weed management practices and provide an assessment of the risks associated with the introduction of this technology. Transgenic cotton, lupins, peas, wheat and subterranean clover carrying genes conferring herbicide tolerance are being evaluated under field conditions, though it is not expected that these trials will all lead to the commercialization of herbicide-resistant crops. In some cases, eg wheat, herbicide tolerance has been used to demonstrate that stable transformation of the target species has been achieved. Commercialization will ultimately depend on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks of the technology and the value of herbicide-resistance as part of an overall strategy for weed management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://caws.org.nz/old-site/awc/1996/awc199610491.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:38BmnRTrZOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
