Organic P (Po) compounds play key roles in biological and ecosystems function in the terrestrial environment being critical to cell function, growth and reproduction.We asked a group of experts to consider the global issues associated with Po in the terrestrial environment, methodological strengths and weaknesses, benefits to be gained from understanding the Po cycle, and to set priorities for Po research.We identified seven key opportunities for Po research including: the need for integrated, quality controlled and functionally based methodologies; assessment of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16564063862660570495", "cites_id": ["16564063862660570495"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-017-3391-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f53EqlJg3-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 29, "2020": 31, "2021": 36, "2022": 44, "2023": 23}}
