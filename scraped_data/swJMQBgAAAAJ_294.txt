Ornithopus sativus was included as a highly P-efficient benchmark species. Plants were grown as microswards in pots with five rates of P supplied in a topsoil layer to mimic uneven P distribution within a field soil profile. Topsoil and subsoil roots were harvested separately to enable measurement of the nutrient-foraging responses. Critical P requirement (lowest P supply for maximum yield) varied over a 3-fold range, reflecting differences in root morphology and acclimation of nutrient-foraging roots to P stress. Among the species, there was a 3.2-fold range in root length density, a 1.7-fold range in specific root length and a 2.1-fold range in root hair length. Ornithopus sativus had the lowest critical P requirement, displayed a high root-length density, the highest specific root length, and the longest root hairs. Acquisition of P from P-deficient soil was facilitated by development of a large root-hair cylinder (ie, a large root-soil interface). This, in turn, was determined by the intrinsic root morphology attributes of each genotype, and the plasticity of its root morphology response to internal P stress. Root acclimation in low-P soil by all species was mostly associated with preferential allocation of mass to nutrient-foraging roots. Only O. sativus and four of the Trifolium species adjusted specific root length beneficially, and only O. sativus increased its root hair length in low-P soil."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:T_ojBgVMvoEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hans-Lambers/publication/353263037_Critical_phosphorus_requirements_of_Trifolium_species_The_importance_of_root_morphology_and_root_acclimation_in_response_to_phosphorus_stress/links/60f60c990859317dbdf4cf63/Critical-phosphorus-requirements-of-Trifolium-species-The-importance-of-root-morphology-and-root-acclimation-in-response-to-phosphorus-stress.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Ytj3iuUPd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
