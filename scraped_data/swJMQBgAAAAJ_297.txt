The research was carried to examine the optimum particle size of rubber crumb, when used within concrete, which will provide the maximum freeze-thaw protection. The investigation extends the range of earlier work carried out by Richardson, Coventry, and Ward,(2011) Richardson, Coventry, Dave, and Dave, J,(2011).The rubber crumb used within the test was divided into five batches, where the concrete mix increased the rubber crumb size in instalments of 0.5 mm. The range of rubber crumb used was between 0.5 to 2.5 mm. The primary properties of the concrete investigated were; air content, freeze-thaw durability and compressive strength."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/17302/1/Concrete_society_article_-_James_Lucky_2014.docx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3QryKd7IiaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
