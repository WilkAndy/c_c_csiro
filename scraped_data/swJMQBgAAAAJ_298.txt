Two different sizes of 3D fibres with perimeters of 115 mm and 220 mm were considered. Fresh properties were determined through slump flow, J-ring, V-funnel and sieve segregation tests. The test results reveal that the addition of 3D fibres decreases the workability of the SCC. 3D fibres with a perimeter of 220 mm have a more adverse effect on the fresh properties of SCC than 3D fibres with a perimeter 115 mm. The balling effect occurred when 3% fibre volume fractions of 3D fibres with a perimeter of 220 mm were added to the mixture, compromising the workability of SCC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:HJSXoJQnj-YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17837937549746696680&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6PFAKrEVjfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
