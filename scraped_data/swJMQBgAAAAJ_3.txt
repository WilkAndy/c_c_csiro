For phosphorus (P), soil microorganisms are involved in a range of processes that affect P transformation and thus influence the subsequent availability of P (as phosphate) to plant roots. In particular, microorganisms can solubilize and mineralize P from inorganic and organic pools of total soil P. In addition, microorganisms may effectively increase the surface area of roots. Also, the microbial biomass itself contains a large pool of immobilized P that potentially is available to plants. Given that most soils are deficient in plant-available P and that P fertilizer represents a significant cost for agricultural production throughout the world, there is interest in using soil microorganisms as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 1188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7831174104868805628", "cites_id": ["7831174104868805628"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP01093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_FvxZlvrrWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 6, "2005": 18, "2006": 26, "2007": 33, "2008": 30, "2009": 33, "2010": 56, "2011": 48, "2012": 72, "2013": 69, "2014": 72, "2015": 72, "2016": 96, "2017": 89, "2018": 84, "2019": 89, "2020": 67, "2021": 98, "2022": 76, "2023": 30}}
