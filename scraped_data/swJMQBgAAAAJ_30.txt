We examined thirty-two temperate soils (with soil organic C concentrations 12\u2013449 g C kg\u2212 1 and total P 295\u20133435 mg P kg\u2212 1) for biogeochemical properties of soil C, reactive surfaces and P by common indices and 31P-NMR spectroscopy on NaOH\u2013EDTA extracts for P species. Arable soil P was dominated by inorganic orthophosphate (276\u20132520 mg P kg\u2212 1), > monoester P (105\u2013446 mg P kg\u2212 1). The limited diesters, polyphosphates and microbial P in arable soils suggest that cropping and fertiliser inputs limit ecosystem microbial functions and P diversity. Intensive grassland had inorganic orthophosphate concentrations (233\u2013842 mg P kg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6256725012301791124", "cites_id": ["6256725012301791124"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000919", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lL-Mxz9a1FYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 25, "2019": 28, "2020": 19, "2021": 30, "2022": 22, "2023": 12}}
