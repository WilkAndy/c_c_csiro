A promoter deletion series was prepared as outlined in Figure 1A and used to generate reporter gene constructs (Fig. 1B). The constructs included an intron derived from the maize (Zea mays) Adh1 gene as this had previously been shown to increase expression levels by more than 15-fold without altering promoter specificity (Schunmann et al., 2004). In addition to the five deletion constructs (Pht1; 1-\u03941 to Pht1; 1-\u03945), a negative control (3# end\u0394) was designed that lacked 85 nucleotides of 3# sequence including the putative transcription start and 5# untranslated region of the HvPht1; 1 gene. The HvPht1; 1 promoter constructs were analyzed using a rice system since its high transformation efficiency enabled numerous promoter variants to be assessed in detail as stably transformed lines, and many studies support the hypothesis that cloned promoters commonly retain their native expression profile when transformed into related species (see Komari et al., 1998). Preliminary experiments showed that the full-length HvPht1; 1 promoter attached to green fluorescent protein (GFP) conferred expression in similar tissues in both barley and rice (data not shown)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/51449162/Promoter_analysis_of_the_barley_Pht11_ph20170120-19951-1jtcmdq.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qc6w1psfX_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
