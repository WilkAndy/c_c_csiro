If this concrete can be produced with lower life cycle costs due to enhanced durability, this will have a significantly reduced environmental impact on our world. The addition of polypropylene fibres to concrete may significantly and beneficially affect the mobility of ions in the concrete matrix by causing physical changes in the microstructure, The fibres themselves are electrical insulators and hence, their presence will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan-Richardson-4/publication/235268761_Electrical_properties_of_Portland_cement_with_the_addition_of_polypropylene_fibres_-_regarding_durability/links/54f854f70cf28d6deca1ca39/Electrical-properties-of-Portland-cement-with-the-addition-of-polypropylene-fibres-regarding-durability.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hoHNc2mb6HMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
