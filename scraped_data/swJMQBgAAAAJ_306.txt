Previous research in the Mallee has shown that the management of biologically available C is the key to improving biological functions including those involved in N mineralisation and availability. Crop residues are one of the major sources of C for soil biota therefore stubble retention can provide benefits through changes in soil physical, chemical and biological properties which influence carbon turnover, nutrient generation and subsequent availability of nutrients to crops (Gupta and Roget, 2008). Although stubble retention benefits are expected to be realised in all soil types, the magnitude and nature of change in biological functions can vary depending on type and timing of stubble management and is influenced by soil type and environmental factors (eg rainfall).Most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14548488297420766193&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Tuxegad5skJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
