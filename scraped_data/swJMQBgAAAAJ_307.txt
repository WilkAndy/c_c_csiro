Because of their oligotrophic nature, archaea play an important role in biogeochemical processes in nutrient-limited Arctic soils. With the existing knowledge of high archaeal abundance and functional potential in Arctic soils, this study employed t-RFLP profiling and geostatistical analysis to explore 30 spatial dependency and edaphic determinants of overall archaeal (ARC) and ammonia oxidizing archaeal (AOA) communities in a high Arctic polar oasis soil. Overall communities were spatially dependent at 2-5 m scale (P< 0.05) whereas AOA communities were dependent at~ 1 m scale (P< 0.0001). Soil moisture, pH and total carbon content were key edaphic factors driving both the ARC and AOA community structure. However, AOA evenness had 35 simultaneous correlations with dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and mineral nitrogen, indicating a possible niche differentiation for AOA in which dry mineral and wet organic soil microsites support different AOA genotypes. Richness, evenness and diversity indices of both ARC and AOA communities showed high spatial dependency along the landscape and resembled scaling of edaphic factors. The spatial link between archaeal community structure 40 and soil resources found in this study has implications for predictive understanding of archaea-driven processes in polar oases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7167707018739194144&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
