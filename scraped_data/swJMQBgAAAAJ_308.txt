However, the benefits of citrate and phytase exudation have been shown to be limited in soils due to interactions with soil (George et al. 2005) or the decoupled expression of these traits in individual plants. The combination of beneficial root exudation traits in P responsive plant systems may therefore improve plant access to sparingly available soil P."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Courtney-Giles/publication/288345147_Understanding_the_complementarity_between_citrate_and_phytase_exudation_on_the_acquisition_of_soil_phosphorus_by_plants/links/5680722508ae051f9ae7cc47/Understanding-the-complementarity-between-citrate-and-phytase-exudation-on-the-acquisition-of-soil-phosphorus-by-plants.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
