It is generally recognised that crushed recycled construction aggregate material produces concrete of a lower compressive strength, when used as an aggregate replacement due to deleterious materials within the aggregate. It is generally accepted that in the UK, freeze/thaw attack is, after chloride-induced corrosion, the most common cause of concrete deterioration. This paper addresses the freeze/thaw durability of recycled aggregate concrete using a paired comparison test based upon weight loss and final compressive strength. Recycled aggregate concrete was found to be of at least equal durability to concrete manufactured with virgin aggregates. This was due to careful selection of the replacement aggregate and treatment prior to batching. Durability is an important material property \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12229820677648988733", "cites_id": ["12229820677648988733"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652610003707", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pbr-JRwNuakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 13, "2014": 17, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 11, "2018": 24, "2019": 14, "2020": 25, "2021": 22, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
