Phytate accumulates in soils over time, particularly with sustained P addition, suggesting a restriction to its mineralisation. Despite accumulations in soils, mechanisms for mineralisation of phytate do exist. Enzymes which specifically catalyse its hydrolysis (phytases) have been identified in plants and microorganisms. However, plants have poor ability to acquire P from phytate. Phytase is either not secreted from plant roots or may be ineffective upon secretion to the rhizosphere. Low solubility of phytate in soil solution may also limit hydrolytic reactions. In order to investigate the limitations to mineralisation of phytate in the rhizosphere, lines of transgenic Trifolium subterraneum which expressed a phytase gene (phyA) from Aspergillus niger were generated.
