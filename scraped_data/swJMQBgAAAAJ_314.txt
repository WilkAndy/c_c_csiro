On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported 30 in products. Given the finite nature of global P resources, it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed. For low P-sorbing soils, P-efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment.\u2022 ScopeP-balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion, runoff or 35 leaching, uneven dispersal of animal excreta, and accumulation of P as sparinglyavailable phosphate and organic P in the soil. In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion. Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to~ 5% of P-fertiliser inputs. However, the rate of P accumulation in P-sorbing soils is a major contributor to inefficient P-fertiliser use. We discuss the 40 causal edaphic, plant and microbial factors in the context of soil P management, P cycling and productivity goals of farms. Management interventions that can alter P-use efficiency are explored, including better targeted P-fertilisers use, organic amendments, removing other constraints to yield, zone management, use of plants with low critical-P requirements, and modified farming systems. 45\u2022 Conclusions"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP111423&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xRCw9rhQKj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
