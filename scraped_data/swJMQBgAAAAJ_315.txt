Plants contain large amounts of inositol phosphates, especially in seeds, where they function as a storage compound. Soils also contain inositol phosphates in abundance, some of which exist nowhere else in nature. Monogastric animals cannot digest phytic acid, so considerable research has been directed towards improving the availability of this compound in animal feeds. Such efforts are aimed in part at reducing phosphorus concentrations in animal manures, because the pollution of water bodies by phosphorus in runoff from agricultural land in now one of the most pervasive problems in the \u2018developed\u2019world. Biochemical research on inositol phosphates in animal nutrition is at the cutting edge of the discipline, yet the environmental impacts of this technology \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13780432508472861528&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WCPFxlruPb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
