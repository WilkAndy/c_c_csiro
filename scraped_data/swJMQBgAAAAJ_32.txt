Microscopic and chemical analysis was carried out on the rubber sample to investigate how rubber crumb entrains air and reacts with the surrounding concrete. The work contained two pilot studies that informed the main test methodology. The pilot studies examined the air content/compressive strength relationship (1) and freeze/thaw cycle durations (2). Pilot study 1 informed the main test program by identifying an optimum addition of rubber crumb to a concrete mix, which was found to be 0.6% by weight of concrete. The main test investigated the use of rubber crumb in providing freeze-thaw protection of a C40 concrete mix after 3 days of curing. A freeze-thaw test was carried out on three separate batches of concrete containing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9158878648063115225", "cites_id": ["9158878648063115225"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652611003842", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2T-2xprfGn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 15, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 18, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 24, "2023": 13}}
