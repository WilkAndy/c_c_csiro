Three independently transformed lines showed increased extracellular phytase activity compared with a vector control and wild\u2010type plants, both of which had no detectable extracellular phytase. Transgenic N. tabacum plants grown in sterile agar supplied with phosphorus (P) as phytate accumulated 3.7\u2010fold more P than vector control plants. Despite this, the expression of ex::phyA in plants did not lead to an improved accumulation of P from two unamended P\u2010deficient soils. However, when soils were amended with either phytate or phosphate and lime, transgenic plants accumulated up to 52% more P than controls. Positive responses by transgenic plants were, in some instances, coincident with a putative increase in soil phytate. We conclude that the development of plants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 160, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=158059608340767442", "cites_id": ["158059608340767442"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7652.2004.00116.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0iJ9WGCKMQIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 15, "2010": 14, "2011": 17, "2012": 16, "2013": 14, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
