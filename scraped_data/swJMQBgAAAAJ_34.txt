Phytase was collected from the roots of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana that express a phytase gene from Aspergillus niger. Phytase activity in solution and on the solid phase of the soil was monitored over time. Phytase added to the solution phase of a soil suspension (1:20, w/v) was almost completely lost within 10min in all soil types, while phytase in non-soil controls remained active in solution. Phytase activity lost from solution was recovered on the soil solid phase, suggesting rapid adsorption of the enzyme. Adsorption of phytase was less in soil taken from the rhizosphere of transgenic plants expressing phyA, indicating that the rhizosphere environment may help maintain phytase activity in solution. The activity of adsorbed phytase declined with time at a rate 2\u20134 times slower than that in the absence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16581349381695510054", "cites_id": ["16581349381695510054"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071704004122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JpaaMGnJHOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 13, "2008": 10, "2009": 9, "2010": 8, "2011": 11, "2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
