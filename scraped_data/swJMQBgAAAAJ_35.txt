Interactions between inorganic P, plants and soils have been studied extensively. However, less is known about the transformation of organic P to inorganic orthophosphate. This paper investigates what is known about organic P in pasture/grassland soils used for agriculture, as well as the research needed to utilise organic P for sustainable plant production.Organic P comprises > 50% of total soil P in agricultural systems depending on location, soil type and land use. Organic P hydrolysis and release of orthophosphate by phosphatase enzymatic activity is affected by a range of factors including: (a) the chemical nature of the organic P and its ability to interact with the soil matrix; (b) microorganisms that facilitate mineralisation; (c) soil mineralogy; (d) soil water electrolytes; and (e \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13045696846451145487", "cites_id": ["13045696846451145487"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706113004321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D3snrCmgC7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 16, "2017": 21, "2018": 19, "2019": 22, "2020": 21, "2021": 22, "2022": 15, "2023": 1}}
