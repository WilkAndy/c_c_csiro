To identify promoter regions controlling gene regulation specificities, successive promoter truncations were made and attached to reporter genes. Promoters of between 856 and 1,400 nucleotides activated gene expression in a number of cell types but with maximal expression in trichoblast (root hair) cells. For shorter promoters the trichoblast specificity was lost, but in other tissues the distribution pattern was unchanged. The low P induction response was unaffected by promoter length. Domain exchange experiments subsequently identified that the region between \u2212856 and \u2212547 nucleotides (relative to the translational start) is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14299203849594369333", "cites_id": ["14299203849594369333"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/136/4/4205/6112553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NXX4CST6cMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 12, "2010": 10, "2011": 14, "2012": 3, "2013": 17, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
