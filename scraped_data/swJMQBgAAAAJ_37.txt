Overapplication of P fertilizer to soil is in itself wasteful, but the transport of P to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2110960252891546637", "cites_id": ["2110960252891546637"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es2044745", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DcSRaCqjSx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 16, "2016": 14, "2017": 10, "2018": 20, "2019": 17, "2020": 14, "2021": 22, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
