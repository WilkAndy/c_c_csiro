Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that shifts in woodland community composition correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon, while changes in pasture community composition correlated with moisture, nitrogen and phosphorus. Weighted correlation network analysis detected two distinct microbial modules per land use. Bacterial and fungal ribotypes did not group separately, rather all modules comprised of both bacterial and fungal ribotypes. Woodland modules had a similar fungal\u2009:\u2009bacterial ribotype ratio, while in the pasture, one module was fungal dominated. There was no correspondence between pasture and woodland modules in their ribotype \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15004658432692070745", "cites_id": ["15004658432692070745"], "pub_url": "https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.12559", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WSmusFhBO9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 20, "2021": 26, "2022": 35, "2023": 11}}
