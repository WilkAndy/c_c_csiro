It is therefore desirable to identify plants with enhanced abilities to utilize P more efficiently. Exudation of phosphatase from roots may improve P availability, yet there is little direct evidence for this. Here we report the dynamics of organic P in the rhizosphere of plants that have enhanced rhizosphere phosphatase activity. Agroforestry species and transgenic subterranean clover (engineered to produce phytase) were compared with crop and wild\u2010type plant controls, respectively. Depletion of organic P was measured in pools defined by chemical extraction, solution 31P NMR spectroscopy, and microbial immobilization of radio\u2010isotopic P. Plants that had greater extracellular phosphatase activity depleted more organic P from P\u2010deficient Oxisols than control plants. Depleted organic P forms were primarily phosphate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16657570435755812078", "cites_id": ["16657570435755812078"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00767.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7iRGRA6UK-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 4, "2013": 18, "2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
