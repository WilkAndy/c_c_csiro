Our understanding of biogeographic controls in microbial communities is likely hampered by the enormous environmental variability encountered across spatial scales and the broad diversity of microbial life histories. Here, we constrained environmental factors (soil chemistry, climate, above\u2010ground plant community) to investigate the specific influence of space, by fitting all other variables first, on bacterial communities in soils over distances from m to 102\u2003km. We found strong evidence for a spatial component to bacterial community structure that varies with scale and organism life history (dispersal and survival ability). Geographic distance had no influence over community structure for organisms known to have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11776201212337462748", "cites_id": ["11776201212337462748"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2010.04804.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3B3mEJx4baMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 14, "2013": 9, "2014": 14, "2015": 9, "2016": 19, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 14, "2020": 18, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
