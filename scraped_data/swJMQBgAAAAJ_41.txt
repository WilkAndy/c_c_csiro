We have investigated the use of the promoter from the ArabidopsisPht1;2 phosphate transporter to drive the expression of a secretable Aspergillus niger phytase gene only in the root epidermis of phosphate-deprived plants. Deletion analysis of this promoter indicated that, while the 933 bp upstream of the start codon is sufficient for root-specific and phosphate-responsive reporter gene expression, the 2000 bp upstream of the start codon are required for maximum expression levels. We show that transgenic Arabidopsis plants in which this 2000 bp promoter drives the Aspergillus phytase gene secrete phytase enzyme only from roots when grown on medium containing low phosphate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5777183730946743541", "cites_id": ["5777183730946743541"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945203002863", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Rw_lf6tLFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 14, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
