These compounds are rarely detected elsewhere in nature and remain poorly understood, partly because conventional procedures for their determination are lengthy and erroneous. We report a straightforward procedure for the determination of scyllo\u2010inositol phosphates in soil extracts using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Solution 31P NMR chemical shifts of a range of synthetic scyllo\u2010inositol phosphate esters were determined in alkaline solution. Of these, only the signal corresponding to scyllo\u2010inositol hexakisphosphate at approximately 4.2 ppm was identified in soil NaOH\u2013EDTA extracts, constituting between 6.5 and 9.8% of the NaOH\u2013EDTA extracted P. This signal has been previously assigned to choline phosphate, but we confirmed it to be an inositol phosphate using hypobromite oxidation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13294407999279645886", "cites_id": ["13294407999279645886"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2004.8020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vsQseKM5f7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 12, "2006": 7, "2007": 13, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
