They are important in agriculture because they constitute most of the phosphorus in grain seeds, but they cannot be digested by some animals. As a result, considerable research has been directed towards improving the digestibility of inositol phosphates in animal diets. Inositol phosphates are also abundant in soils and water bodies, yet a clear understanding of their behaviour in the environment remains elusive.  This is surprising given the importance of phosphorus in the nutrition of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Written by leading experts, this book brings together critical reviews on inositol phosphates in agriculture, ecology, and the environment.  The sixteen chapters cover a diverse range of topics, including the synthesis and hydrolysis of inositol phosphates, their role in animal nutrition, and their fate in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10978434349842938195", "cites_id": ["10978434349842938195"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1079/9781845931520.0000", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U7lV_N87W5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 16, "2021": 10, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
