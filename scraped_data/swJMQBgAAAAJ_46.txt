Five independently transformed lines showed an average 77\u2010fold increase in exuded phytase activity in comparison with null segregant and wild\u2010type controls. Unlike other phosphatases, exuded phytase activity was unaffected by P supply, verifying the constitutive expression of phyA. Transgenic T. subterraneum grown in agar with P supplied as phytate, took up 1.3\u2010 to 3.6\u2010fold more P than controls and had equivalent P uptake to plants supplied with orthophosphate. This unique phenotype was compromised when the plants were grown in soil. None of the five lines showed increased shoot biomass or total P uptake in an unfertilized, low\u2010P soil taken from under permanent pasture. With addition of P, one of the five transgenic lines had consistently greater P nutrition compared with control plants.
