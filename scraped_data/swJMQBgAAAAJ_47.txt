This work evaluated the interaction of phytases with goethite, haematite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and two oxisol clays and investigated how this interaction is affected when myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) was sorbed on the mineral surfaces. phyA histidine acid phosphatases of fungal origin were used and their ability to release orthophosphate from the InsP6-saturated minerals was evaluated. The phytases showed a high affinity for the mineral surfaces, with a loss of enzyme activity generally being observed over 24 h (up to 95% of the initially added activity). The loss of phytase activity was dependent on the type of mineral, with kaolinite and montmorillonite showing the greatest effect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14760594918604806910", "cites_id": ["14760594918604806910"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071709004659", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_hrgnN8q2MwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 13, "2015": 16, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 17, "2023": 1}}
