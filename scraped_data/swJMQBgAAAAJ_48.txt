The amplified fragment length polymorphisms (amplification profiles) generated by the 2 arbitrary primers (RPO4 and RPO5), effectively differentiated a diverse collection of Rhizobium meliloti, R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii and R. l. bv. viciae strains. The nif-directed primer (RPO1) was also highly discriminatory on Rhizobium DNA and generated unique amplification profiles for each strain. For selected strains, reproducible amplification profiles were obtained using a variety of DNA sources, and these were achievable over a 125-fold range in template concentration. Amplification profiles generated by the primers RPO5 and RPO1 were shown to be temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1131826518763056028", "cites_id": ["1131826518763056028"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003807179598626Y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nCs93jgOtQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 6, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 10, "2005": 11, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
