A small number of studies have used correlation network analyses to investigate fungal\u2013bacterial co-occurrences in soil, and revealed differences, as well as overlaps, in the ecosystem roles of these groups. These results contradict the view that fungi and bacteria are two distinct functional groups which can be studied in isolation. A more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between soil properties, biogeochemical cycles and the interactions between fungi and bacteria will be an important step towards improving the prediction and management of soil ecosystem services."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11074314950610573418", "cites_id": ["11074314950610573418"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527417300061", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:atjw-cXer5kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 24, "2021": 27, "2022": 38, "2023": 18}}
