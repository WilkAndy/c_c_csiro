Microbial decomposition of OM may vary with quality of OM, addition of nutrients and functional types of microbes. While the role of fungi and bacteria in OM decomposition has received considerable attention, the succession and co-occurrence patterns of these communities during decomposition remain unexplored. Using 454 pyrosequencing and network analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS genes in a time-course microcosm experiment, this study shows a positive effect of nutrient addition on overall microbial biomass and abundance of bacteria and fungi. Abundance of different bacterial and fungal groups changed up to 300-folds under straw- and nutrient amended treatments while \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 558, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17902262847913592671", "cites_id": ["17902262847913592671"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071716300268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XweQvTWdcfgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 19, "2018": 36, "2019": 46, "2020": 78, "2021": 143, "2022": 152, "2023": 81}}
