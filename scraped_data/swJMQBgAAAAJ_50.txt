In the experiments reported here, transcriptional and translational fusions of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene to Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii nodulation (nod) genes were used to investigate the effects of pH and of Ca and Al ions on nod gene expression. The regulatory nodD gene in R. leguminosarum biovar trifolii was constitutively expressed at a range of pH levels between 4.8 and 6.5, and expression was not affected by the addition of 22.5 \u03bcM Al or 1,250 \u03bcM Ca. Induction of expression of nodA, nodF, and region II nodulation genes in the presence of 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 M 7,4\u2032-dihydroxyflavone was restricted at a pH of <5.7 and was extremely poor at pH 4.8. Induction of nodA expression was further restricted by 22.5 \u03bcM Al over a range of pH levels but was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16546265534752552552", "cites_id": ["16546265534752552552"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.54.10.2541-2548.1988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aPY2htYkoOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 4, "1992": 4, "1993": 7, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 8, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
