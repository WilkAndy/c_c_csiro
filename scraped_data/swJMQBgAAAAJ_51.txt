The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects on compressive strength of various dosages of monofilament polypropylene fibres when used in concrete. Compressive strength is widely used as the key indicator of concrete quality and therefore needs accurate determination. Monofilament fibres and air entrainment provide a similar function in that they provide freeze/thaw protection, they are both compared against a plain concrete sample to determine relative strength and density.Two different concrete design strengths (medium and high) were examined with varying amounts and types of polypropylene fibre fraction/volume to establish a common link between fibre additions and reduced final compressive strength.The findings from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11730857993538265443,13281859301390800226", "cites_id": ["11730857993538265443", "13281859301390800226"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02630800610666673/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y2FmPzFhzKIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 17, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
