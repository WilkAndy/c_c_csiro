In the present experiments a bioassay with an indicator strain ofR. trifolii, which contained thelacZ gene fromEscherichia coli fused to theR. trifolii nodA gene, was used to measure the level ofnod gene expression inR. trifolii. Compounds that stimulatednodA gene expression were shown to be present in exudates of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and nine cultivars of subterranan clover (T. subterraneum L.) seedling sgrown at a range of pH between pH 3.0 and pH 8.0. Thenod gene-induction activity of exudates was, however, reduced when seedlings of all clover species were grown at pH>7.0 and at pH<4.0 and pH<5.0 for white clover and subterranean clover respectively. No major differences were apparent in the activity of exudates from seedlings of the various cultivars of subterranean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7302265609576228012", "cites_id": ["7302265609576228012"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02197578", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rKRXAuLbVmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 4, "1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 5, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
