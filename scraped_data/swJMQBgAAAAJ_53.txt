The supply of P to living organisms is strongly dependent on the dynamics of soil organic P. However, fluxes of P through soil organic matter remain unclear because only a minority (typically <30%) of soil organic P has been identified as recognizable biomolecules of low molecular weight (e.g., inositol hexakisphosphates). Here, we use 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the speciation of organic P in soil extracts fractionated into two molecular weight ranges. Speciation of organic P in the high molecular weight fraction (>10 kDa) was markedly different to that of the low molecular weight fraction (<10 kDa). The former was dominated by a broad peak, which is consistent with P bound by phosphomonoester linkages of supra-/macro-molecular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2934299220326903290", "cites_id": ["2934299220326903290"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b02948", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-m1KJJi5uCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 15, "2020": 18, "2021": 23, "2022": 17, "2023": 9}}
