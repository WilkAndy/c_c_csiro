The cereal lines were selected on the basis of differences in their rate of root growth, Al-resistance and root hair morphology. Root morphology was assessed after 7 days of growth. The length of fine (mainly lateral) roots of Al-sensitive genotypes was more sensitive to soil Al concentrations than that of the coarse (mainly primary) roots. The experiments demonstrated that even where root growth was protected by expression of the TaALMT1 gene for Al-resistance, root-soil contact \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10373800733926610278", "cites_id": ["10373800733926610278"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-009-0047-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZtVhBM4k948J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 20, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
