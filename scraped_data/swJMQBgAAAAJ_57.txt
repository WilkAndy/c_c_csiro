Phytase from an ascomycete fungus (Aspergillus niger) and a basidiomycete fungus (Peniophora lycii) was added to soil suspensions from three contrasting soils and activities in the solution and solid phase were monitored. The two enzymes were compared because the P. lycii phytase was known to have greater specific activity and a more acidic isoelectric point (pI) than A. niger and therefore predicted to have different adsorption characteristics. When added to soil suspensions buffered at pH 7.5, both phytases remained in solution in all of the soils. In contrast at near natural soil pH (pH 5.5), only the P. lycii phytase remained in solution, while the A. niger phytase was rapidly adsorbed to the soil solid phase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17727171903252675184", "cites_id": ["17727171903252675184"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071706004482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cDqpZeyQA_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
