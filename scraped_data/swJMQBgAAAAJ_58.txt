These are: Histidine acid phosphatase (HAP), \u03b2-propeller phytase (BPP), Cysteine phosphatase (CP), and purple acid phosphatase (PAP). The representatives of each of these classes have different catalytic mechanisms and other unique features that allow them to effectively utilize myo-inositol hexakisphosphate as a substrate at various pH values. The fact that each is different also broadens the number of enzymes that may be applied to the search for developing an enhanced phytase for current and future applications of such enzymes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11614809738337544119", "cites_id": ["11614809738337544119"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9781845931520.0097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t2dbS-sXMKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
