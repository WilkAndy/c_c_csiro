However, factors influencing the structure and function of denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere remain unclear. Waterlogging can result in root anoxia and increased denitrification, leading to significant N loss from soil and potential nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. This study investigated denitrifier gene abundance, community structure and activity in the rhizosphere of wheat in response to anoxia and N limitation. Denitrifier community structure in the rhizosphere differed from that in bulk soil, and denitrifier gene copy numbers (nirS, nirK, nosZ) and potential denitrification activity were greater in the rhizosphere. Anoxia and N limitation, and in particular a combination of both, reduced the magnitude of this effect on gene abundance (in particular nirS) and activity, with N limitation having greater impact than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18087365184997704849", "cites_id": ["18087365184997704849"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/83/3/568/594799", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kUSOBs46A_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 16, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
