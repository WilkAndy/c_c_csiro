Although soils may contain a large amount of total P, only a small proportion is immediately available to plants. Australian soils often have low availability of P for plant growth and P-based fertilisers are, therefore, commonly used to correct P deficiency and to maintain productivity. For many soils, the sustained use of P fertiliser has resulted in an accumulation of total P, a proportion of which is in forms that are poorly available to most plants. The efficiency with which different P fertilisers are used in agricultural systems depends on their capacity to supply P in a soluble form that is available for plant uptake (i.e. as orthophosphate anions). In addition to fertiliser source, the availability of P in soil is influenced to a large extent by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 493, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5245700787367287107", "cites_id": ["5245700787367287107"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/cp07125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q5kDvRJ5zEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 9, "2010": 14, "2011": 16, "2012": 30, "2013": 40, "2014": 35, "2015": 27, "2016": 49, "2017": 37, "2018": 40, "2019": 41, "2020": 40, "2021": 46, "2022": 43, "2023": 26}}
