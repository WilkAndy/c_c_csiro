This work investigated the effect of soil acidity on primary root length and root-hair and rhizosheath development of five perennial grass genotypes varying in acid-soil resistance. Plants were grown in three low-P acid soils that were limed (CaCO3) to modify soil pH (0.01 M CaCl2 extractable) from <4.3 to >5.0 and Al3+ concentrations from \u2265 16 to <4 mg kg\u22121 (0.01 M CaCl2 extractable). Root morphology of tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Z.-W. Liu & R.-C Wang), phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) and weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides Labill. R. Br.) was assessed after 20\u201325 days growth. The root length of tall wheatgrass and phalaris cv Sirosa was sensitive to acidity, with lateral root length more sensitive to acidity than seminal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14799257756325311064", "cites_id": ["14799257756325311064"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-010-0433-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WPI2AYWGYc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
