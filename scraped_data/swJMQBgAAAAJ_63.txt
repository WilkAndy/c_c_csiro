For soil and environmental scientists, agronomists, plant physiologists and breeders alike, there has been a common goal to better understand the physico-chemical and biological interactions of P in soil-plant systems. Factors that influence the availability, mobility and subsequent uptake and utilization of P by plants have been of particular interest. A key objective of this research effort has been to better manage this valuable soil resource in both natural systems and agricultural soils and to optimize inputs of fertilizer P for maximum agricultural benefit. Techniques in molecular biology provide new tools for addressing important questions in the understanding of plant responses to P-deficiency and are providing rapid advance in the identification and characterization of various \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7403868377549264831", "cites_id": ["7403868377549264831"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-009-0071-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v1eS3w_Tv2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
