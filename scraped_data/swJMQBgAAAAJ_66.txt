Our aim was to evaluate the validity of this concept. Most studies that report \u2018positive effects\u2019 of PSM on plant growth have been conducted under controlled conditions, whereas field experiments more frequently fail to demonstrate a positive response. Many studies have indicated that the mechanisms seen in vitro do not translate into improved crop P nutrition in complex soil\u2013plant systems. Furthermore, associated mechanisms are often not rigorously assessed. We suggest that PSM do not mobilise sufficient P to change the crops\u2019 nutritional environment under field conditions. The current concept, in which PSM solubilise P \u2018for the plant\u2019 should thus be revised. Although PSM have the capacity to solubilise P to meet their own needs, it is the turnover of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14683582583612103811", "cites_id": ["14683582583612103811"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.16924", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g9xPFpCQxssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 12, "2022": 46, "2023": 22}}
