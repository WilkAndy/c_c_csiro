Phosphorus is a non-renewable and finite resource, and there are environmental and economic reasons for using P more effectively. We review the P balance of temperate pastures to identify the factors contributing to inefficient use of P fertiliser and discuss ways to improve P-balance efficiency. Immediate gains can be made by ensuring that P fertiliser inputs are managed to ensure that the plant-available P concentrations of soil do not exceed the minimum concentration associated with maximum pasture production. Unnecessarily high soil P concentrations are associated with greater potential for P loss to the wider environment, and with higher rates of P accumulation in soils that have a high P-sorption capacity. Soil microorganisms already play a crucial role in P cycling and its availability for pasture growth, but are not amenable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17524707424962567291", "cites_id": ["17524707424962567291"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/CP13395", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e1yLmY1ENPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 17, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
