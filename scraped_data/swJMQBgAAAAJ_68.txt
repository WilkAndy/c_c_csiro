Acid phosphomonoesterase (\u2018phosphatase\u2019) activity of root segments was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. When plant growth was P-limited, elevated CO2 concentrations increased phosphatase activity more than at ambient CO2. This result (1) was evident when expressed on a unit root dry weight or root length basis, indicating that increased root enzyme activity was unlikely to be associated with CO2-induced changes in root morphology; (2) occurred when plants were grown aseptically, indicating that the increase in phosphatase activity originated from root cells rather than root- associated microorganisms; (3) was associated with shoot P concentrations below 0.18%; (4) occurred only when wheat roots were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12866315193184355875", "cites_id": ["12866315193184355875"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP97045", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Iwb34X9VjrIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
