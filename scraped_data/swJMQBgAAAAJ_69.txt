P budgets (P input vs P output) were developed to examine P use in a long-term experiment in which grazing systems were managed with contrasting soil test P concentrations: (i) no P-fertiliser (P0; Olsen P = 2\u20135 mg/kg), (ii) near-optimum soil P fertility (P1; Olsen P = 10\u201315 mg/kg), (iii) supra-optimal P fertility (P2; Olsen P = 20\u201325 mg/kg), or (iv) with variable P fertility. Pastures were grazed with either 9 or 18 sheep/ha. P was exported as liveweight gain in sheep removed from the fields. Fertilised fields accumulated 89\u201393% of their P input over the whole P-budgeting period (1994\u20132006). However, this included P that was contributing to a \u201cbuild up\u201d in soil fertility (1994\u20132000). The efficiency of P fertiliser use was better demonstrated by P budgets during a soil P fertility \u201cmaintenance\u201d phase (2001\u20132006) in which P inputs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5535075979291139709", "cites_id": ["5535075979291139709"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880915300074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fR5y7kaK0EwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 6, "2019": 20, "2020": 14, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
