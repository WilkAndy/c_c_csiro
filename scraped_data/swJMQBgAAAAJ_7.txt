The C:N:P:S ratios were investigated for a series of soils to test the hypothesis that the stable portion of the soil organic material (humus) has constant ratios of C:N:P:S. Constant ratios, if established, would provide an excellent tool to evaluate the feasibility, cost and strategies to sequester soil C in terrestrial ecosystems. Freshly-collected Australian soils cited in the literature were analysed for total C, N, P, organic P (OP) and S, and the ratios were compared with values for soils from numerous locations around the world, hereafter known as the International soils.Total N and S were highly correlated with C for the International and Australian soils and the relationships were similar for both sets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 483, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1488183059405329605", "cites_id": ["1488183059405329605"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706111000905", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xdSbmJsWpxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 8, "2012": 15, "2013": 22, "2014": 36, "2015": 41, "2016": 45, "2017": 38, "2018": 47, "2019": 50, "2020": 52, "2021": 64, "2022": 39, "2023": 25}}
