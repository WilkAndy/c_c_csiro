Transposon Tn5 mutagenesis was used to isolate mutants of strain ANU1173, which were unable to grow on media at a pH of less than 4.8. The acid-tolerant strain ANU1173 maintained a near-neutral intracellular pH when the external pH was as low as 4.5. In contrast, the acid-sensitive mutants AS25 and AS28 derived from ANU1173 had an acidic intracellular pH when the external pH was less than 5.5. The acid-sensitive R. leguminosarum biovar trifolii ANU794, which was comparatively more sensitive to low pH than mutants AS25 and AS28, showed a more acidic internal pH than the two mutants when the three strains were exposed to medium buffered at a pH of less than 5.5. The two acid-sensitive mutants had an increased membrane permeability to protons but did not change their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13485808891862743593", "cites_id": ["13485808891862743593"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.59.6.1798-1804.1993", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KXpIfLw3J7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
