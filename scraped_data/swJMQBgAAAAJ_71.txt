The magnitude of fire-induced changes in soil properties and soil microbial communities was determined by comparing (1) variation in fire-adapted eucalypt woodland vs. pasture grassland at the burnt site; (2) variation at the burnt woodland-pasture sites with variation at two unburnt woodland-pasture sites in the same locality; and (3) temporal variation pre- and post-fire. In the eucalypt woodland, soil ammonium, pH and ROC content increased post-fire, while in the pasture soil, soil nitrate increased post-fire and became the dominant soluble N pool. However, apart from distinct changes in N pools, the magnitude of change in most soil properties was small when compared to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12748197581643121936", "cites_id": ["12748197581643121936"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071717301438", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EAVVXCiy6rAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 18, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
