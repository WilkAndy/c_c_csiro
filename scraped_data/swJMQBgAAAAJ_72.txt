We assessed the spatial variation within each land-use plot, including the influence of sampling distance, soil chemical characteristics and, where appropriate, proximity to trees on the soil bacterial community, by generating terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The soil bacterial community under the revegetated site was more similar to the original woodland than the pasture, and this result was found regardless of the soil- or the DNA-pooling strategy used. Analyzing as few as eight cores per plot was sufficient to detect significant differences between the bacterial communities under the different plots to be distinguished. Soil pH was found to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10913315125675088689", "cites_id": ["10913315125675088689"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/78/1/70/522497", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MdvCG0nic5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
