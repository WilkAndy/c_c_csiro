Poor availability of P in soil and consequent P-deficiency represents a major constraint to crop production globally (Runge-Metzger 1995). Soil P status is also a key factor that controls the competitive dynamics and species composition in different natural ecosystems (McGill and Cole 1981; Attiwill and Adams 1993), and thus may have significant impact on biodiversity (Wassen et al. 2005). Many plant species have evolved in P-limited environments and, as a consequence, are known to possess a number of adaptive features that can enhance the acquisition of P from soil (Raghothama 1999; Vance et al. 2003; Richardson et al. 2005). However, ongoing selection of crop cultivars, in nutrient replete environments, for traits such as yield and vigor (and thus an adaptation to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10920088526642352371", "cites_id": ["10920088526642352371"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8435-5_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8xBWaqjyi5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
