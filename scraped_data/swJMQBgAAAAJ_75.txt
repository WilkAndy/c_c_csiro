They belong to a special class of phosphomonoesterases termed myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydolases, which are capable of initiating the stepwise release of phosphate residues from phytate (salts of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate), the major storage form of phosphate in plant seeds and pollen. The ability of such enzymes to hydrolyse phytate is usually known only from in vitro assays, and information on their in vivo function is rather limited. As enzymes are classified in general by their in vivo function, the term \u2018phytate-degrading enzyme\u2019is preferred here to the term \u2018phytase\u2019, and is used throughout the chapter.
