The population of R. trifolii was largely confined to the top 2 cm of the soil profile. Lower numbers occurred deeper in the soil profile. Factors that influenced the numbers of R. trifolii in the soil and the rate of soil colonization were; soil pH and moisture content, the presence of the host plant and the severity of the dry summer. In clover dominant treatments, large increases in the numbers of R. trifolii in the soil occurred at the end of the growing season. This was thought to be associated with senescing nodules and was considered to be an important factor in the development of populations of R. trifolii. Low soil pH markedly influenced the distribution of the population of R. trifolii, with highest proportions occurring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1125242206872465735", "cites_id": ["1125242206872465735"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071788900545", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R_HoStOpnQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 5, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
