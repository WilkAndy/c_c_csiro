Mt. Barker was 80% relative to that of strain ANU794, a Smr derivative of the commercial inoculant R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii TA1. Strain ANU1173 contained four indigenous megaplasmids, the smallest of these being the symbiotic (Sym) plasmid. The critical pH requirement for growth of strain ANU1173 in laboratory media was shown not to be associated with this plasmid. When the Sym plasmid of strain ANU1173(pSym-1173) was mobilized into a Nod- strain of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae, the plasmid conferred to the transconjugant a level of symbiotic effectiveness in association with T. subterraneum that was similar to that observed with ANU1173.
