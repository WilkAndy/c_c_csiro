Shoot and root growth by plant lines were measured and effects of reducing the influence of soil microorganisms were investigated by pasteurising the soils. Plants that expressed phyA did not have better P-nutrition than control plants after 56 days growth, except in a soil that contained a large concentration of both total organic P and organic P that was amenable to hydrolysis by a plant-derived phytase. Pasteurisation had little effect on the relative P-nutrition of the various plant lines in any of the soils. Roots of transgenic plants that expressed ex::phyA were shorter than controls up to 21 days growth in a number of soils, which resulted in an initial greater P accumulation efficiency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6931422453800831841", "cites_id": ["6931422453800831841"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-005-8699-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YQv3Wv9bMWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
