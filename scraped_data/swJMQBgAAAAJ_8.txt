Despite this, most soils contain significant amounts of total soil P that occurs in inorganic and organic fractions and accumulates with phosphorus fertilization. A major component of soil organic phosphorus occurs as phytate. We show that when grown in agar under sterile conditions, Arabidopsis thaliana plants are able to obtain phosphorus from a range of organic phosphorus substrates that would be expected to occur in soil, but have only limited ability to obtain phosphorus directly from phytate. In wild\u2010type plants, phytase constituted less than 0.8% of the total acid phosphomonoesterase activity of root extracts and was not detectable as an extracellular enzyme. By comparison, the growth and phosphorus nutrition of Arabidopsis plants supplied with phytate was improved significantly when the phytase gene (phyA) from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 468, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2107616356717085320", "cites_id": ["2107616356717085320"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.00998.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iMLs6OjBPx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 9, "2004": 16, "2005": 28, "2006": 20, "2007": 30, "2008": 22, "2009": 35, "2010": 23, "2011": 28, "2012": 29, "2013": 23, "2014": 21, "2015": 35, "2016": 25, "2017": 26, "2018": 19, "2019": 14, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
