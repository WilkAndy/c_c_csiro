In particular, soil microorganisms are effective in releasing P from inorganic and organic pools of total soil P through solubilization and mineralization. The microbial biomass in soil also contains a significant quantity of immobilized P that is potentially available to plants. Microorganisms therefore are critical for the transfer of P from poorly available soil pools to plant available forms and are important for maintaining P in readily available pools. These processes are likely to be most significant in the rhizosphere of plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17809295085946324632", "cites_id": ["17809295085946324632"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-5765-6.pdf#page=90", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mMbw4YVTJ_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 2}}
