This was consistent with growth of the strains over a range of pH in liquid culture. Concentrations of Al in excess of 150 \u03bcM were necessary to inhibit growth of R. trifolii in agar-culture at pH 5.10. Sensitivity of growth to Al was also influenced by the concentration of P in the medium. Acid-tolerance of R. trifolii isolates collected from a very acid soil was considered to be poor and was similar to that observed for R. trifolii strains TA1 and WU95. Only 96 of 481 isolates were capable of growth in solid media at pH 4.70, whereas all isolates made growth at pH 5.10. The proportion of isolates capable of growth at pH 4.70 was not related to the pH of the soil from which they were isolated, but was influenced by the method of isolation. A higher proportion of more acid-tolerant isolates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16482970982477184318", "cites_id": ["16482970982477184318"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071789900163", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pr2fLcdGv-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
