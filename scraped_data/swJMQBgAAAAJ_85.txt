Soil microorganisms in particular are able to release plant available P from otherwise sparingly available forms of soil P, through solubilisation and mineralisation reactions of inorganic and organic P, respectively. The potential of phosphate solubilising microorganisms (PSM)Phosphatesolubilising microorganism (PSM) to improve plant P nutrition is widely recognised, and the mechanisms involved are being investigated. The feasibility of developing efficient management systems based on PSM as biofertilisers is of current interest in rhizosphere biotechnologyRhizospherebiotechnology. Mycorrhizosphere interactions involving PSM and their interaction with AM fungi is of further relevance for the acquisition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16894864408069443466", "cites_id": ["16894864408069443466"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-08575-3_24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:io9ek6qdduoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
