This paper describes a novel technique for repeated in situ collection of low molecular weight organic anions from plant roots grown in large-scale rhizotrons under controlled environmental conditions. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) was used to collect organic anions from the soil\u2013root interface. The recovery and stability of 12 organic anions (tartarate, quinate, formate, malate, malonate, shikimate, lactate, acetate, maleate, citrate, succinate and fumarate) on AEM was first assessed under controlled conditions using solution and soil media. The AEM strips were shown to be effective for the capture of the range of organic anions from both solution and soil. Contact between AEM impregnated with anions and soil reduced the recovery of organic anions from the AEM by an average of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10380610654503837745", "cites_id": ["10380610654503837745"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847210001620", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MSBWNWRWD5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 9, "2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
