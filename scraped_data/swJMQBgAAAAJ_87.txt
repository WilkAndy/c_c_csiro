In this study, soil microbial biomass, bacterial community structure (determined by TRFLP), and function, (determined by enzyme assays and Biolog assays), and soil physicochemical properties were investigated in a wheat cropping system subjected to long-term tillage (20 years) and short-term nutrient addition treatments. Samples were taken over a full cropping cycle. Tillage, nutrient addition, and time all significantly affected bacterial community structure (rDNA and rRNA), which showed considerable shifts across the sampling period. Microbial biomass and Biolog profiles changed significantly with time, but were not affected by treatment. With regard to specific enzyme assays, there were significant main effects of treatment and time on glucosidase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=293782484766237948", "cites_id": ["293782484766237948"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071712004701", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_CS5BZ25EwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
