Analysis of global literature indicated that microbial detritus carbon (C) contributed 59 and 64% of total soil C in arable agricultural and grassland systems respectively, with a 2.5% greater contribution of bacterial-derived detritus in grasslands and with no difference in the proportional contribution of fungal detritus. Total soil C and nitrogen (N) content was higher in grasslands with an average of 2.8 and 1.6 g N kg\u22121 soil and 28.8 and 16.8 g C kg\u22121 soil in grassland and arable systems, respectively. Soil N content explained 11 to 28% of the variance in microbial detritus contribution to soil C. Further, total soil N and C content explained more variance than other factors which are commonly considered to mediate SOM content including precipitation, acidity and clay. Microbial biomass C assimilation and re-metabolism of SOM are affected by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15067306483343274893", "cites_id": ["15067306483343274893"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-020-10076-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jbOdpWrTGdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 25, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
