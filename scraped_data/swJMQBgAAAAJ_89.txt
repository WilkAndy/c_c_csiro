Enzyme activity has therefore been used as a surrogate for microbial activities and an indicator of soil productivity. Although numerous studies have assessed enzyme activity individually in different ecosystems, little is known about soil factors that determine their spatial structure and associated variation in activities across ecotones. Ecotones provide unique opportunities to study how soil properties vary spatially within and across adjacent land-uses. This study used multiple approaches, including geostatistical kriging, principal component analysis (PCA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the determinants and spatial distribution patterns of six key soil enzymes across two grassland-woodland ecotones in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4276172161106472905", "cites_id": ["4276172161106472905"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139316300956", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yW8qpewDWDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 14, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
