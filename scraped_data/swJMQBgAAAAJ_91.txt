The role of actinobacteria in cellulose degradation has not been extensively investigated despite their abundance in soil and known cellulose degradation capability. Here, the diversity and abundance of the actinobacterial glycoside hydrolase family 48 (cellobiohydrolase) gene in soils from three paired pasture-woodland sites were determined by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and clone libraries with gene-specific primers. For comparison, the diversity and abundance of general bacteria and fungi were also assessed. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of 80 clones revealed significant new diversity of actinobacterial GH48 genes, and analysis of translated protein sequences showed that these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13352889409854898512", "cites_id": ["13352889409854898512"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.00067-15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UAF67yv-TrkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 9, "2023": 7}}
