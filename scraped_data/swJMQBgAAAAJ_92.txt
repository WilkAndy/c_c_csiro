Restricted nodulation occurred in regions with very low soil pH and this consequently affected the distribution of nodules on roots throughout the entire soil profile. Nodulation was improved in all profile regions where lime was incorporated into the soil; this resulted in a more uniform distribution of nodules. Surface application of lime influenced nodulation only at the very top of the soil profile.Restrictions to nodulation at low pH were largely compensated for by the plant, either by a shift in the distribution of nodules to less acidic regions of the profile, or by an increase in the mass of individual nodules. Total nodule mass per plant was therefore generally the same in all pasture treatments despite large differences in the total number of nodules.The major determinants of restricted nodulation of subterranean clover roots in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4826049501883487903", "cites_id": ["4826049501883487903"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071788900557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n1Y31HOS-UIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
