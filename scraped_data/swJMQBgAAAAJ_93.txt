Phosphorus deficiency is a major constraint to the growth of plants in many agricultural systems throughout the world and influences species composition in natural ecosystems (eg Wassen et al., 2005). This is despite the fact that soils generally contain a relatively large amount of total phosphorus. This total phosphorus includes organic and inorganic forms that are bound to soil particles by adsorption reactions or are present in mineral and precipitated complexes. Agricultural production systems are therefore reliant on the application of phosphorus-based fertilizers to meet the phosphorus requirement of plants. Such fertilizers are composed primarily of soluble inorganic phosphate processed from rock phosphates, or are derived from animal manures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3701580948878123083", "cites_id": ["3701580948878123083"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1079/9781845931520.0242", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S-A73UKoXjMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
