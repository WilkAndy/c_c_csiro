Here, we explored the bacterial community structure and occurrence of putative PGPR in plants grown in agro-ecosystems and undisturbed ecosystems from northern, central, and southern Chile. Total rhizobacterial community structure was evaluated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and dominant bands present in diverse ecosystems were sequenced. Significant differences in total bacterial communities were shown with some bacterial orders (Enterobacteriales, Actinomycetales, and Rhizobiales) being highly similar to both ecosystems. Twenty-nine putative PGPR, showing phytate- and ACC-degrading activities and production of auxin, were selected from across the sites.
