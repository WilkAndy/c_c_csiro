Myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP) is the major organic P form in many soils, but the conversion of IHP to plant-available orthophosphate is restricted by precipitation and sorption reactions, which limit the solubility of IHP and activity of phytase enzymes. Organic anion (OA) production by Pseudomonas spp. was expected to improve the bioavailability of P in insoluble calcium-IHP (CaIHP) to Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) plants. Bacterial production of OAs at concentrations greater than 40 mM resulted in a \u223c2-unit decrease in media pH and solubilization of CaIHP salts in agar media. Plant inoculation with an OA-producing and phytate-mineralizing soil isolate (Pseudomonas sp. CCAR59) improved shoot P accumulation by wild-type (WT) and citrate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7848397926149982503", "cites_id": ["7848397926149982503"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713003271", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JwkVzFQc62wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
