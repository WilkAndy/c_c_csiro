Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a range of microorganisms possess the ability to utilize phytate in their environment (Shieh and Ware, 1968; Irving and Cosgrove, 1971; Power and Jagannathan, 1982; Richardson and Hadobas, 1997; Yanke et al., 1998). These microorganisms occur in a variety of diverse habitats and do not employ an identical method to degrade phytate. Phytases, defined as enzymes that initiate the cleavage of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, are now classified into four groups based on common biochemical and catalytic mechanisms.
