In particular the paper outlines the need for an integrated and holistic-multidisciplinary approach to deal with historic and ongoing high inputs of P to intensively managed agroecosystems. This commentary is designed to complement the Ulrich et al. manuscript by highlighting the vital role of \u201cresidual\u201d or \u201clegacy\u201d P in tightening P cycling to maintain productivity in farming systems with reduced P inputs and minimise P transfer from land to water. It is well established that most of the P applied to agroecosystems in the form of mineral fertilisers, manures and wastes is retained in the soil as inorganic and organic P that is otherwise only sparingly available to plants. For example, accumulation of P in soil under cropping in Western Europe between 1965 and 2007 amounted to over 800 kg P ha\u00c01 (Sattari et al., 2012), which included significant quantities of organic P in the form of phosphomonoesters (Stutter et al., 2012). Whilst this legacy P accumulated in the soil has enormous potential to \u2018off-set\u2019fertilizer inputs, it also represents a significant environmental risk\u2013if not appropriately managed, the accumulated P can cause enhanced eutrophication of rivers, lakes and estuaries, resulting in wide spread loss of socioeconomic value in these systems and accumulation of P in depositional zones.Improved utilisation of legacy P across all environmental systems could, in many cases, allow a reduction or more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "swJMQBgAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5919256723886110929", "cites_id": ["5919256723886110929"], "pub_url": "https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/21864/stri_Environ_Dev_8_147-148.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0fiS-aBsJVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
