In terms of their responses to stress and disturbance, Dominant Dolichoderinae (DD) are considered analogous to trees, functionally subdominant Generalized Myrmicinae (GM) to shrubs and ruderal Opportunists (OPP) to grasses. Community types DD0 (twenty-two sites), DDI (twenty-two sites), DD2 (eight sites), DD3 (thirty-nine sites) and DD4 (three sites), respectively, are defined as having the relative abundance of Dominant Dolichoderinae $<10%$, 10-19%, 20-29%, 30-70% and $>90%$. They are structurally analogous to treeless plant communities, open woodlands, woodlands, forests and plantations, respectively. DD0 communities are classified as DD0GM (analogous to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 679, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13908001463187512117", "cites_id": ["13908001463187512117"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2846070", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NZvnnKQlA8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 7, "1997": 7, "1998": 8, "1999": 11, "2000": 21, "2001": 12, "2002": 10, "2003": 19, "2004": 16, "2005": 16, "2006": 26, "2007": 28, "2008": 28, "2009": 26, "2010": 35, "2011": 34, "2012": 48, "2013": 44, "2014": 29, "2015": 21, "2016": 33, "2017": 31, "2018": 31, "2019": 35, "2020": 30, "2021": 28, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
