In this paper, we briefly discuss five key values of such studies. These are: (1) quantifying ecological responses to drivers of ecosystem change; (2) understanding complex ecosystem processes that occur over prolonged periods; (3) providing core ecological data that may be used to develop theoretical ecological models and to parameterize and validate simulation models; (4) acting as platforms for collaborative studies, thus promoting multidisciplinary research; and (5) providing data and understanding at scales relevant to management, and hence critically supporting evidence\u2010based policy, decision making and the management of ecosystems. We suggest that the ecological research community needs to put higher priority on communicating the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 432, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5467486464616710498", "cites_id": ["5467486464616710498"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02351.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YkG8ufhp4EsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 22, "2015": 26, "2016": 27, "2017": 39, "2018": 39, "2019": 52, "2020": 59, "2021": 72, "2022": 57, "2023": 26}}
