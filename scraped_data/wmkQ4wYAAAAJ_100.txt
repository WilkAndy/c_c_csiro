Indeed, Australian savannas act as refugia for significant elements of the Australian fauna that have suffered marked declines elsewhere in the country (Woinarski and Braithwaite 1990). However, there are clear signs of major range contractions and population declines for some species in recent times (Braithwaite and M\u00fcller 1997; Franklin 1999; Woinarski et al. 2001), and there is widespread concern that inappropriate fire management is an important contributing factor.Much public concern over fire is directed at its immediate effects on fauna. Several studies have recorded large numbers of animals being killed by wildfire, either directly by the flames or by smoke inhalation (Recher et al. 1975; Christensen 1977; Fox 1978; Wright and Bailey 1982; Bowland and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7747839997009838953", "cites_id": ["7747839997009838953"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-21515-8_8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:acNVbm3bhWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
