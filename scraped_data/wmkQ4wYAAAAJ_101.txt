Eight of the >15 harvester species known from adjacent 30\u2003\u00d7\u200330\u2010m plots, comprising four species of Meranoplus and two species each of Monomorium and Pheidole, maintained conspicuous nest middens. 2.\u2002All these eight harvester species are monomorphic (or functionally so in the context of seed collection), with total body length ranging from 2\u00b70 to 5\u00b70\u2003mm. The two species of Monomorium are column foragers, whereas the others apparently forage solitarily. Nests averaged 0\u00b71\u2003m2, but were highly patchy both within and between plots. 3.\u2002Seed fragments from a total of 33 plant species were identified from 50 middens sampled during the end of the wet season, with up to 19 seed species recorded from a single \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3384707036414331315", "cites_id": ["3384707036414331315"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2000.00452.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s8k93h3l-C4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 7, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
