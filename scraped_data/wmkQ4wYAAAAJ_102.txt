Sampling was conducted during the dry season (June) of 1988, with supplementary litter samples collected dUring the following wet season. A total of 102 species (19-41 per patch, mean 33) from 33 genera were recorded, with the richest genera being Pheldole (13 species), Monomonum (12) and Polyrhachis (10). Arid-adapted genera such as tridomyrmex and Melophorus were Virtually absent. Forty-six species were considered to belong to Torreslan taxa, three to Eyrean taxa, five to Basslan taxa, and 48 to widespread taxa. Surrounding open sclerophyll habitats support a far greater proportion of Eyrean taxa, and lesser proportion of Torresian taxa. This survey provides baseline data for monitoring any future change In the Kimberley rainforest habitats."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8130948155658542967", "cites_id": ["8130948155658542967"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/32363", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dx8lmUTu1nAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
