Such biodiversity significance is due to the plateau\u2019s isolation from other sandstone massifs, its enduring presence within surrounds marked by long-term instability, the diversity of topographic (and resultant microclimatic) features that it offers, and the protection it affords from some otherwise pervasive threats. Some important components of this biodiversity are now in decline, with such trends driven by inappropriate fire regimes and invasive plants and animals. The management priorities required to maintain the biodiversity values of the plateau area are: to reduce the incidence, extent and severity of fire; to control feral animals (particularly cats and buffalo) more effectively; to prevent spread to the plateau of invasive pasture grasses; and to establish or enhance comprehensive monitoring programs that measure trends in biodiversity and management effectiveness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3110349674030411257", "cites_id": ["3110349674030411257"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2J7mOvX3JR0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA201&dq=info:-a3Vl4wuKisJ:scholar.google.com&ots=rrtr_vry67&sig=iGX9sKCVHv0SrIknhkqf--PRcn0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-a3Vl4wuKisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
