This is the first comprehensive documentation of any rainforest ant fauna in the Northern Territory. A total of 47 species (six of them introduced) from 24 genera was collected. These include a previously uncollected species of Polyrhachis Fr. Smith, a new generic record (Ectomomyrmex Mayr) for the Northern Territory, and the first record of Monomorium talpa Emery from Australia. the most common ants on the ground were Opportunists (particularly species of Paratrechina Motschoulsky, Rhytidoponera Mayr and Odontomachus Latreille), Generalised Myrmicinae (mostly Pheidole spp.), and Cryptic Species (mostly M. talpa). Canopy ants were abundant and composed almost entirely of tree\u2010nesting taxa, primarily species of Oecophylla Fr. Smith \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8320666965816828443", "cites_id": ["8320666965816828443"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1994.tb00942.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G-LWR4XyeHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
