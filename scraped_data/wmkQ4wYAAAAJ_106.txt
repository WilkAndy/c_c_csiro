Using large datasets on Pheidole geographical distributions and phylogeny, we (1) inferred patterns of biogeographical modularity (clusters of areas with similar faunal composition), (2) tested whether species in open habitats are more likely to be expanding their range beyond module boundaries, and (3) tested whether there is a bias of lineage flow from high\u2010 to low\u2010diversity areas.The Old World.We compiled and jointly analysed a comprehensive database of Pheidole geographical distributions, the ecological affinities of different species, and a multilocus phylogeny of the Old World radiation. We used network modularity methods to infer biogeographical structure in the genus and comparative methods to evaluate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18230987390917369494", "cites_id": ["18230987390917369494"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12592", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ll5BrHB6Af0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 10, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
