These taxa have contrasting biogeographical histories, which are predicted to lead to contrasting responses to fire. Iridomyrmex is an autochthonous Australian genus that has radiated primarily in the arid zone; as such, its abundance is predicted to be promoted by frequent fire because this maintains an open habitat. In contrast, Oecophylla is a genus of leaf\u2010nesting ants occurring in the canopies of Old World tropical rainforest, and is a recent arrival to Australia in geological time; the abundance of these ants is predicted to decline under frequent fire. We test these predictions using results from a landscape\u2010scale fire experiment, where three experimental fire regimes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13113805509690906966", "cites_id": ["13113805509690906966"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00353.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VtmvkqGY_bUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
