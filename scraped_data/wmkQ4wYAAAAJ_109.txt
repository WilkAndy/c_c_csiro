Linking ecological traits to disturbance response helps clarify what different bioindicator groups are actually indicating, providing a mechanistic basis for predicting the responses of other taxa. Dung beetles and ants are ecologically contrasting but widely used bioindicator taxa. Here we link variation in dung beetle assemblages to body size and dung-feeding behavior, and variation in ant communities to habitat preferences, foraging behaviour and competitive dynamics, to clarify what dung-beetles and ants are indicating in terms of biodiversity responses to pastoral land management in a Brazilian savanna landscape. Dung beetles and ants were sampled at 24 pastoral sites that varied in grass cover, tree density, pasture age, cattle density, and frequency of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4525284108539787527", "cites_id": ["4525284108539787527"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19307587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B_k7tesJzT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 15, "2023": 13}}
