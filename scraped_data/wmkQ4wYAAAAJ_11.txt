In particular, the use of functional groups has provided a predictive framework for analysing ant community responses to disturbance in the absence of reliable information on the responses of individual species. Here we review 45 studies of the responses of Australian ant communities to disturbance, in order to: (i) identify individual species or species\u2010groups that respond consistently to disturbance; and (ii) examine the usefulness of the functional group scheme as a framework for predicting ant community responses under different disturbance regimes in different biogeographical regions. The most common forms of disturbance in our studies were fire (17 studies), mining (12; mostly studies of minesite restoration) and grazing (7), with other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 381, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13039258878271092470", "cites_id": ["13039258878271092470"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2003.01301.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9va0Zd3A9LQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 13, "2007": 12, "2008": 15, "2009": 22, "2010": 19, "2011": 22, "2012": 22, "2013": 27, "2014": 22, "2015": 22, "2016": 34, "2017": 26, "2018": 23, "2019": 20, "2020": 12, "2021": 28, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
