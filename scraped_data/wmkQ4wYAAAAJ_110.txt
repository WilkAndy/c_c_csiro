In this study, we use ant taxonomic and functional diversity to examine the effects of different land uses (agriculture, pastoralism, silviculture and conservation) and restoration practices on Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) biodiversity. We also examine the extent to which ant diversity and composition can be explained by vegetation attributes that apply across the full land management spectrum. We surveyed vegetation attributes and ant communities in five replicate plots of each of 13 land\u2010use and restoration treatments, including two types of native vegetation as reference sites: cerrado sensu stricto and cerrad\u00e3o. Several land\u2010use and restoration treatments had \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13080215348421212862", "cites_id": ["13080215348421212862"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12676", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vjpCtI5ChrUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
