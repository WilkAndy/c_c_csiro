However, a negative effect of disturbance on visitation by attendant ants could prevent EFN\u2010bearing plants from acting as disturbance winners. Here, we address the effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on the abundance of EFN\u2010bearing plants and their interactions with attendant ants in Caatinga vegetation of northeastern Brazil. We recorded the abundance of EFN\u2010bearing plants, proportion of plants visited by ants and composition of ant attendant species at 24 sites varying in levels of disturbance. EFN\u2010bearing plants as a whole did not behave as a disturbance winner group. The responses of the 13 species to increasing disturbance were highly variable, with three species declining in abundance (loser species). The richness of ant species attending EFNs did \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5656218175056907039", "cites_id": ["5656218175056907039"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12230", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HwtgWHbsfk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 14, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
