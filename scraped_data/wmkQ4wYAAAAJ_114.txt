Many taxonomically and ecologically similar species are now undergoing widespread decline across the northern Australian mainland, possibly driven by predation by feral cats and changed fire regimes. Here, we report marked recent declines of native mammal species in one of Australia's few remaining areas that support an intact mammal assemblage, Melville Island, the largest island off the northern Australian coast. We have previously reported a marked decline on Melville Island of the threatened brush\u2010tailed rabbit\u2010rat (Conilurus penicillatus) over the period 2000\u20132015, linked to predation by feral cats. We now report a 62% reduction in small mammal trap\u2010success and a 36% reduction in site\u2010level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11609098803407838327", "cites_id": ["11609098803407838327"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12596", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d1yJo9rNG6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
