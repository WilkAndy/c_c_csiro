We analyse the co\u2010occurrence of a remarkable 10\u201315 species of the ant genus Monomorium occurring within single 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009m plots in a tropical savanna of northern Australia. Most of the species are undescribed, so we use genetic analysis to validate our species demarcations. We document nest dispersion patterns, and investigate differentiation in the three primary niche dimensions: space, time and food. We also examine species differences in competitive abilities, by describing rates of foraging activity, foraging ranges, worker aggression, and levels of behavioural dominance. Analyses of nest and forager distributions showed very limited evidence of spatial segregation within plots. The great majority of species foraged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7456874914787816328", "cites_id": ["7456874914787816328"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12000", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iPNyDjokfGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
