Mangrove communities, which like the rainforests have closed canopies, are major components of the Australian tropics; however, their ant faunas remain poorly known, despite ants being the dominant insect group in them. This paper describes the ant fauna of a mangrove community in Darwin Harbour, and compares it with the regional savanna and rainforest fauna. Ants were sampled at baits located on the ground, foliage, and tree trunks, along three transects following the elevation/tidal gradient. Sixteen ant species were recorded in mangroves, including three savanna species, six rainforest species (one, Monomorium ?turneri, not previously recorded in Northern Territory), five habitat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14649404560761701068", "cites_id": ["14649404560761701068"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/zo9960521", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zEIwB9UjTcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
