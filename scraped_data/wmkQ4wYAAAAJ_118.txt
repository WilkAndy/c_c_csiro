Leaf-cutting ants are an example of such winner organisms in tropical rain forests, but their response to disturbance in dry forests is poorly known. We investigated Atta colony density in areas of tropical dry forest in Brazil with different distance to roads and vegetation cover. Atta colonies were surveyed in 59 belt transects of 300 \u00d7 20 m, covering a total area of 35.4 ha. We found 224 Atta colonies, 131 of which were active and belonged to Atta opaciceps (87 colonies, 2.45 ha\u22121), A. sexdens (35 colonies, 0.98 ha\u22121) and A. laevigata (9 colonies, 0.25 ha\u22121). The density of active colonies sharply decreased from 15 \u00b1 2.92 ha\u22121 in the 50-m zone along roads to only 2.55 \u00b1 1.65 ha\u22121 at distances up to 300 m. The reverse pattern was observed for inactive colonies.
