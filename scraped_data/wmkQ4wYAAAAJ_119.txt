The overall ant fauna of monsoonal rainforest is known reasonably well, but with just one exception (Holmes Jungle in Darwin) the faunas of individual rainforest patches have been only superficially studied. This paper comprehensively documents an ant fauna of a spring-fed rainforest patch at the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near Darwin, contrasts it with that of surrounding savanna, and compares it with the Holmes Jungle fauna. Ants were sampled at 21 locations within the TWP rainforest, using Winkler sacs for litter-dwelling species (160 samples), standard pitfall traps for ground-active species (75 traps), and baited pitfall traps taped to trees for arboreal species (75 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3346178828275694778", "cites_id": ["3346178828275694778"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/zo07066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ujxOXuoDcC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 10, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
