The ant fauna was extremely diverse, with 81 species from 24 genera recorded. Species were classified into functional groups based on habitat requirements and competitive interactions, with the most important groups being dominant species of Iridomyrmex (11 species, 14-63% total ants in traps); generalized myrmicines (mostly species of Monomorium and Pheidole; total of 22 species, 11-61% total ants in traps); hot climate specialists (species of Melophorus. Monomorium (\"Chelaner\") and Meranoplus; total of 14 species, 1-16% total ants in  traps); cryptic species (many genera; total of 13 species, 2-27% total ants in traps); and, opportunists (mostly species of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 373, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17987111807722554015", "cites_id": ["17987111807722554015"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388395", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n4KJquMOn_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 1, "1996": 9, "1997": 10, "1998": 12, "1999": 8, "2000": 14, "2001": 10, "2002": 8, "2003": 15, "2004": 22, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 17, "2008": 11, "2009": 11, "2010": 14, "2011": 15, "2012": 15, "2013": 23, "2014": 21, "2015": 14, "2016": 15, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 14, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
