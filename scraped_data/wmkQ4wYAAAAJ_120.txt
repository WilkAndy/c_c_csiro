However, the extent to which the forest fauna undergoes a parallel process remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that the process of fire-driven forest shifts towards derived savannas has congruent cascading effects on ant communities by causing declines in forest specialists and an influx of open-habitat taxa. In 2013 we collected ants using subterranean, epigaeic and arboreal pitfall traps in three adjacent 50-ha plots: an unburnt control and two treatment plots that were burnt either triennially or annually from 2004 to 2010. Frequent fire was associated with a marked decline of specialist forest species (almost 50%), and an influx of open-habitat taxa that were absent from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4453899169366271267", "cites_id": ["4453899169366271267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320717303828", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I-V7X7Jtzz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
