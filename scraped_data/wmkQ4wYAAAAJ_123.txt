However, the truly remarkable extent of its diversity is not well appreciated, even among myrmecologists, and the reasons for such diversity are poorly understood. The vast majority of ant species in arid Australia are undescribed, and I argue that a recognition of the true diversity of the fauna would re\u2010define the conventional understanding of global ant diversity patterns. For example, Monomorium Mayr and Tetramorium Mayr are formally recognised as widespread but essentially Afrotropical genera, whereas the large majority of species actually occur in arid Australia. The Australian fauna includes many genera each with >100 arid\u2010adapted species, and several of these have >300 species. Melophorus Lubbock is likely to have well over 1000 species, making it one of the world's richest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11560229981071309276", "cites_id": ["11560229981071309276"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aen.12203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3HmTR-svbqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
