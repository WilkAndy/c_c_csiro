Emissions trading for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement in Australia's remote, fire\u2010prone, and sparsely populated tropical savannas provides a financial incentive for intensive fire management that aims to reduce fire frequency, severity, and extent, and it supports important social, economic, and land management opportunities for remote communities, conservation agencies, and pastoralists. These programs now cover >20% of Australia's 1.9 million km2 tropical savanna biome, encompassing areas of globally significant biodiversity value. A common assertion is that by reducing the frequency, severity, and extent of fires for GHG abatement, these programs provide biodiversity co\u2010benefits. However, such biodiversity benefits have been assumed rather than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12258661824013414762", "cites_id": ["12258661824013414762"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/conl.12685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ajH20fqDH6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 14, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
