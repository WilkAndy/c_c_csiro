The dominance\u2010impoverishment rule states that high levels of dominance only occur in species\u2010poor communities, but there appear to be many cases of high levels of dominance in highly diverse communities. The extent to which dominant species limit local richness through competitive exclusion remains unclear, but such exclusion appears more apparent for non\u2010native rather than native dominant species. Here we perform the first global analysis of the relationship between behavioral dominance and species richness. We used data from 1,293 local assemblages of ground\u2010dwelling ants distributed across five continents to document the generality of the dominance\u2010impoverishment rule, and to identify the biotic and abiotic conditions under which it does and does not apply. We found that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6376901970327506699", "cites_id": ["6376901970327506699"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14331", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Cw_cRI5Of1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
