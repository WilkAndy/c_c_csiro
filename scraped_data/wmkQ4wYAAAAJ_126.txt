The lipid\u2010rich elaiosome on the seed provides nutrition to the ants; however, how the plant benefits from myrmecochory remains unclear. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the Euphorbiaceae species in the semi\u2010arid Caatinga vegetation region of northeastern Brazil, and show that myrmecochory strongly associates with small plant stature, even after controlling for seed size. The association of myrmecochory with small stature suggests that the primary benefit to plants concerns distance of dispersal, which reduces parental and sibling competition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7079594693776707742", "cites_id": ["7079594693776707742"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nhBNXN3FP2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
