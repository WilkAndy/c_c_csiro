Three sites were monitored, each with a distinct long-term burning history: burned annually since 1952, burned periodically since 1973, and unburned since 1946. A total of 89 species from 42 genera was recorded over all trapping periods, with the richest genera being Iridomyrmex, Camponotus and Pheidole, each with eight species. Site species richness was 74, 63 and 43, respectively, at the annually burned, periodically burned and the unburned site. We compared the ant community in this forest with those at other forested sites in eastern Australia. Overall, the south-eastern Queensland community was located on the overlap between the Bassian and Torresian zones (not dominated by either element), while the functional-group composition resembled those of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3336284530747315684", "cites_id": ["3336284530747315684"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/zo96069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5BXTtBrdTC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 6, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
