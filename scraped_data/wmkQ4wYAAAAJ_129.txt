Here, we present models of ant species density, using climate, abundance and habitat (i.e. canopy versus litter) as predictors. Ant species density is positively associated with temperature and precipitation, and negatively (or non-significantly) associated with two metrics of seasonality, precipitation seasonality and temperature range. Ant species density was significantly higher in canopy samples, but this difference disappeared once abundance was considered. Thus, apparent differences in species density between canopy and litter samples are probably owing to differences in abundance\u2013diversity relationships, and not differences in climate\u2013diversity relationships. Thus, it appears that canopy and litter ant assemblages share a common abundance\u2013diversity relationship influenced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5023859917121804888", "cites_id": ["5023859917121804888"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0151", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WFpeIfpVuEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
