I adopt two novel approaches to the study of humped diversity patterns. First, I look at the effect of temporal changes in the foraging abundance of dominant species, presumably linked to temporal changes in climatic favorability, on \"momentary\" diversity within a community. Second, I relate diversity directly to the abundance of dominant species rather than to some environmental variable that is assumed to control their abundance. Iridomyrmex spp. and Oecophylla smaragdina were dominant ants at the forest and savanna sites studied: they occurred at a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 336, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14106035947168386550", "cites_id": ["14106035947168386550"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9s3c-_S0wsMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 6, "1994": 6, "1995": 4, "1996": 10, "1997": 12, "1998": 9, "1999": 9, "2000": 15, "2001": 9, "2002": 7, "2003": 12, "2004": 12, "2005": 7, "2006": 13, "2007": 18, "2008": 11, "2009": 12, "2010": 15, "2011": 21, "2012": 15, "2013": 12, "2014": 16, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 15, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
