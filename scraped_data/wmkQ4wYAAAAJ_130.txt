This holds for even highly familiar insect groups such as ants. Here, I propose common names for all major native Australian ant genera and species\u2010groups, as well as for many of the most abundant and distinctive species. Sixty\u2010two genera, 142 species\u2010groups and 50 species are given names. The naming system closely follows taxonomic structure; typically a genus is given a general common name, under which species\u2010group and species names are nested."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7083370834197943911", "cites_id": ["7083370834197943911"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.2002.00312.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zxa7kD4wTWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
