Alternatively, an invader may act as a \u2018back-seat driver\u2019, being facilitated by disturbance that has already caused some biodiversity decline, but then causing further decline. Here we examine the interactive effects of anthropogenic fire and invasive ant species (Anoplolepis gracilipes or Wasmannia auropunctata) on native ant diversity in New Caledonia, a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot. We first examined native ant diversity at nine paired burnt and unburnt sites, with four pairs invaded by Anoplolepis, 5 years after an extensive fire. In the absence of invasion, native epigaeic ants were resilient to fire, but native ant richness and the abundance of Forest Opportunists were markedly lower in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3084120374330228616", "cites_id": ["3084120374330228616"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-013-0455-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iH9_3CP_zCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
