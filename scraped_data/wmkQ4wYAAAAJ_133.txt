There is concern that climate change will exacerbate the impacts of disturbance and thereby promote biotic homogenization, but its consequences for ecological services are unknown. We investigated the individual and interactive effects of increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and aridity on seed dispersal services provided by ants in Caatinga vegetation of north\u2010eastern Brazil. The study was conducted in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil. Within an area of 214 km2, we established nineteen 50 \u00d7 20 m plots that encompassed gradients of both CAD and aridity. We offered diaspores of six plant species, three myrmecochorous diaspores and three fleshy fruits that are secondarily dispersed by ants. We then quantified the number of interactions, seed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17593591725736474549", "cites_id": ["17593591725736474549"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.12979", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tTfGr3X-KPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
