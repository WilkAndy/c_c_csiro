The results presented here demonstrate that insect predation is a major factor influencing ovule survivorship throughout ovule development in Eucalyptus baxteri in south-eastern Australia. (2) The potential life of an ovule was considered to begin with the first appearance of floral buds, and to end as a dispersed seed available for germination. Buds of E. baxteri are produced over summer, and flowering occurs two summers later. One cohort of buds was heavily galled, and less than 20% flowered. Galling appeared to have adverse effects on the proportion of surviving buds flowering and on the proportion of flowers maturing fruit. Mortality of the previous cohort of buds, which was not galled, was also high, but was apparently caused by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2165363098082758107", "cites_id": ["2165363098082758107"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2260916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:20323kPqDB4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
