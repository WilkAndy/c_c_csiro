Thermal limits are used to measure climatic tolerances that potentially affect ectotherm distribution. While there is a strong relationship between the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of insects and their latitudinal ranges, the nature of this relationship across elevation is less clear. Here we investigated the combined relationships between CTmax, elevation and ant body mass, given that CTmax can also be influenced by body mass, in the World Heritage-listed rainforests of the Australian Wet Tropics. We measured the CTmax and body mass of 20 ant species across an elevational gradient from 350 to 1000 m a.s.l. Community CTmax did not vary systematically with increasing elevation and there was no correlation between elevation and elevational ranges of species. However, body mass significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=332730337239257644", "cites_id": ["332730337239257644"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-018-4154-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LFIklXoYngQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 12, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
