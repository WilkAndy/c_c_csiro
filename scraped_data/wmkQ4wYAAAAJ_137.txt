However, the potential limitations of individual transect studies have recently been highlighted. Here, we argue that replicating and networking transects, along with the introduction of experimental treatments, addresses these concerns. Transect networks provide cost\u2010effective and robust insights into ecological and evolutionary adaptation and improve forecasting of ecosystem change. We draw on the experience and research facilitated by the Australian Transect Network to demonstrate our case, with examples, to clarify how population\u2010 and community\u2010level studies can be integrated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17364692657947659664", "cites_id": ["17364692657947659664"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kM3NZvjH-_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
