Using a multi-model averaging approach we examined the association between five chronic disturbance surrogates and the richness and taxonomic and functional composition of ants in Brazilian Caatinga. Using pitfall traps in 47 plots near Parnamirim city (Pernambuco) across two soil types (sand and clay), we recorded 53 species from 27 genera. Ant species richness on sand was slightly higher than on clay, and was negatively related to most surrogates of anthropogenic disturbance. Soil type and human population size were the main predictors of ant species richness. Soil type was the most important predictor of functional group abundance. Taxonomic and functional composition were influenced by soil type and disturbance, but this relationship \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8938807736794315709", "cites_id": ["8938807736794315709"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/chronic-anthropogenic-disturbance-as-a-secondary-driver-of-ant-community-structure-interactions-with-soil-type-in-brazilian-caatinga/370C3993DD6FD1389C3DA3B0FFBDBD3A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vXsj20YGDXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
