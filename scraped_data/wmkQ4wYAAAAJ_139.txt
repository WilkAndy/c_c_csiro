Inappropriate fire regimes have been identified as a factor threatening a number of vertebrate groups, including small mammals, across northern Australia, and a possible mechanism might be through the effects of individual fires or fire regimes on food availability. We test for a fire effect on grass\u2010layer invertebrate resources, which may affect insectivorous savanna vertebrates. Wet season sweep\u2010net invertebrate samples were taken in two tropical savanna habitats, with contrasting laterite and sandstone substrates, in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Sites were stratified by post\u2010fire interval to analyse invertebrate successional change after fire. In addition, experimental burns were implemented in 2010 to investigate immediate post \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13212444608754470623", "cites_id": ["13212444608754470623"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02413.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:385Vf14IXLcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
