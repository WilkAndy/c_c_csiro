The recently established Tiwi Carbon Study aims to identify the biophysical and economic potential of fire management for greenhouse gas abatement on the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin, as a basis for possible livelihood opportunities for the Aboriginal Tiwi people. Recent (2001\u20132010) fire history for the Tiwi Islands based on AVHRR satellite imagery shows that on average 35% (187\u2003700\u2003ha) of its savanna woodlands and open forests are burned every year, with 72% of burning occurring late in the dry season (August to November).
