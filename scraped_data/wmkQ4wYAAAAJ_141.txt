However, little is known of the conservation values of old\u2010growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of highly frequent disturbance. Here we address the value of low fire frequency (<1 fire/10 years) in tropical savannas, the world's most fire\u2010prone biome, in terms of ant biodiversity. We do this by comparing savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of burning every 2\u20135 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP. More than 16\u2003000 ants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2715539625722239711", "cites_id": ["2715539625722239711"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02151.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:39qr7OaIryUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
