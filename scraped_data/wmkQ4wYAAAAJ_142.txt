A total of 138 species from 36 genera were collected, with the richest genera being Monomorium (18 species), Pheidole (16), Polyrhachis (15), Iridomyrmex (12), Paratrechina (9), Camponotus (8) and Meranoplus (6). The most frequently recorded species were Oecophylla smaragdina, Monomorium sp., Tetramorium (\u201cTriglypothrix\u201d) ?lanuginosum, Paratrechina \u201cminutula\u201d, Polyrhachis \u201cinconspicua\u201d and Tapinoma sp. About half of the species collected have Torresian affinities, which, based on data from the Kakadu region, is far higher than in the surrounding savanna. Some of these Torresian species represent specialist rainforest taxa (notably tree\u2010nesting Oecophylla, Crematogaster and Polyrhachis spp \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3467756832265355975", "cites_id": ["3467756832265355975"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1992.tb00480.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x0KcSnfyHzAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
