The study was conducted at two adjacent sites: one that had been burnt by a wildfire during early 1977, and the other long unburnt. Both sites contained a mixture of three mallee eucalypt species: Eucalyptus dumosa, E. foecunda and E. incrassata. In contrast to the canopies of other eucalypt formations elsewhere in southern Australia, abundance and diversity of ants were very high. Ants represented 43-69% of all invertebrates, and a total of 44 ant species from 19 genera was collected. Iridomyrmex and Camponotus respectively contributed 10 and 11 species, and the most abundant ants were species of Iridomyrmex, Monomorium and Crematogaster. Ant composition was broadily similar at the two sites, and on different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7846923994596162950", "cites_id": ["7846923994596162950"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/zo9920205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hr1kXczf5WwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
