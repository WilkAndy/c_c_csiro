By analysing 50,000 tweets from all Partner Institutions of the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, and 45,000 tweets from the main science and environmental news media world\u2010wide, we found strong disparities in attention and interest relative to biome extent and diversity. Tweets largely focused on forests, whereas open biomes (such as grasslands, savannas and shrublands) received less attention in relation to their area. In contrast to these differences in attention, there were equivalent likes and retweets between forest versus open biomes, suggesting the disparities may not reflect the views of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7692504492147752363", "cites_id": ["7692504492147752363"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.14060", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qz2QNxREwWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 14, "2023": 14}}
