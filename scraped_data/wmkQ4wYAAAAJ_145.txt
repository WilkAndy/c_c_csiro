Controlled field experiments are crucial for understanding biodiversity responses, and here I present key insights into faunal responses to fire that have been revealed by them, along with their lessons for fire management.Australian monsoonal tropics.Results are synthesized from six replicated fire experiments that have been conducted in Australian savannas and include multispecies assessments of fauna. The synthesis also draws on other fire studies and is presented in the form of five key insights into faunal responses.The key insights are as follows: (a) most faunal groups are extremely resilient to fire, with highly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7013921297725159565", "cites_id": ["7013921297725159565"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jXh0SUJ0VmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
