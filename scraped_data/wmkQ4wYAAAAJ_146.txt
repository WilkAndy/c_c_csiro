We utilised a long\u2010running, replicated fire experiment on Melville Island, the largest island off the northern Australian coast, to test the importance of pyrodiversity for native mammals in a northern Australian savanna landscape. We first developed statistical models to determine how native mammal abundance has responded to nine years of experimentally\u2010manipulated fire frequency. Next, given each species' modelled response to fire frequency, we identified the level of pyrodiversity and optimal mix of fire frequencies that would be expected to maximise mammal diversity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7308392624618030179", "cites_id": ["7308392624618030179"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y0Rx3V6gbGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
