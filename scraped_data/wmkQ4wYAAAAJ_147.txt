The proportion of fruits attacked by insects averaged 11% (range 3\u201337%) in populations of Leptospermum juniperinum, 23% (6\u201395%) in Leptospermum myrsinoides, 23% (0\u201347%) in Leptospermum laevigatum, and 28% (8\u201345%) in Leptospermum lanigerum. The proportion of seeds lost in attacked fruits also varied widely. Differences between species varied markedly from year to year, but differences between sites were relatively constant. Fruit production by L. myrsinoides was unusually low at most sites during 1984; in each case this coincided with unusually high rates of insect attack, suggesting that predator satiation operates during normal seasons."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2382826854153425493", "cites_id": ["2382826854153425493"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1989.tb01004.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VZITK2aAESEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
