However, ongoing management practices favor vegetation oversimplification, often limiting greenspaces to lawns and tree canopy rather than multi\u2010layered vegetation that includes under\u2010 and midstorey, and the use of nonnative species. These practices hinder the potential of greenspaces to sustain indigenous biodiversity, particularly for taxa like insects that rely on plants for food and habitat. Yet, little is known about which plant species may maximize positive outcomes for taxonomically and functionally diverse insect communities in greenspaces. Additionally, while cities are expected to experience high rates of introductions, quantitative assessments of the relative occupancy of indigenous vs. introduced insect species in greenspace are rare, hindering understanding of how management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7225211787920932800", "cites_id": ["7225211787920932800"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.2309", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wP_9HdcbRWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 15, "2023": 9}}
