Fire management has important social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions; however, a sound understanding of the ecological effects of fire is vital to the success management efforts. In northern Australia, there has been very limited understanding of the broader ecological effects of different fire regimes. Most of our knowledge relates to short-term responses to particular fires and is heavily influenced by the visual appearance of burnt vegetation. A true understanding of fire ecology requires a longer term perspective, considering fire regimes rather than individual fires, and focusing on elements and processes that are fundamental to ecosystem sustainability. Correlative studies of floristic patterns across the landscape can provide a useful indication of ecological responses to fire, but are insufficient for gaining the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11484847409389427033", "cites_id": ["11484847409389427033"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-21515-8_9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wdk4mN5fYp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
