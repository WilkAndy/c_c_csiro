Here we use ants to assess the extent to which livestock grazing is compatible with biodiversity conservation in a tropical savanna of northern Australia, where there is growing pressure to intensify pastoral production. We focus on the extent to which ant responses conform with four general patterns identified in a recent global review: (1) soil and vegetation type have a far bigger impact on ant community composition than does grazing; (2) grazing modifies ant species composition but often not species richness or total abundance; (3) a species\u2019 response often varies among habitats; and (4) between 25\u201350% of the species that can be statistically analysed are responsive to grazing. We sampled ants using pitfall traps at 38 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7935533383776671154", "cites_id": ["7935533383776671154"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-016-1277-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:shVDe5GtIG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
