This chapter offers an overview covering the diversity, taxonomy, biogeography, and functional composition of the Caatinga ant fauna, and a synthesis on ant response to chronic anthropogenic disturbance and increased aridity. We compiled a database consisting of 572 presence\u2013absence ant records and 276 ant species from 37 localities in the Caatinga. As expected, most of the Caatinga has not been intensively sampled for ants, with the intensive sampling that has been conducted revealing high rates of species turnover across localities. Most ant species recorded in the Caatinga are widely distributed in other biomes, especially in Cerrado, and few species can be considered endemic to the Caatinga. Thus, the Caatinga ant fauna appears to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14056643094148840041", "cites_id": ["14056643094148840041"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68339-3_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aXowOWs6E8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
