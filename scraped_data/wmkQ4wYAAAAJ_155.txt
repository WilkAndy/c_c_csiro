We used a manipulative field experiment to investigate the influence of fire and fuel loads on ant communities and their interactions with myrmecochorous seeds in the southern Amazon, a region currently undergoing extreme land-use intensification. Experimental fires and fuel addition were applied to 40 \u00d7 40-m plots in six replicated blocks, and ants were sampled between 15 and 30 days after fires in four strata: subterranean, litter, epigaeic, and arboreal. Fire had extensive negative effects on ant communities. Highly specialized cryptobiotic and predator species of the litter layer and epigaeic specialist predators were among the most sensitive, but we did not find evidence of overall biotic homogenization following fire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14983100210201289282", "cites_id": ["14983100210201289282"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-016-3638-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QuIg30Gq7s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
