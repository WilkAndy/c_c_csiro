Fruits of all species supported abundant and diverse assemblages of seed-eating insects and associated parasites. The distribution of phytophagous insects was related to host-plant phylogeny and, in particular, to fruit morphology. When fruit morphology was relatively constant within a host-plant genus (Eucalyptus and Casuarina), that genus supported a characteristic suite of seed-eating insects; when it varied markedly between species (Leptospermum), so did the composition of seed-eating insects. Insect species often occurred \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8878066409795220534", "cites_id": ["8878066409795220534"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ZO/ZO9870327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NvQrmFw6NXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
