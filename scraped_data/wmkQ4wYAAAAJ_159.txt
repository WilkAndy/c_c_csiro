These conservation values are threatened by inappropriate fire regimes and invasion by the introduced cane toad Bufo marinus. Ants were sampled at 16 sites in the Mitchell Falls area, eight each on laterite and sandstone substrates, representing the two regionally dominant landforms. At each site, ants were sampled using 40 pitfall traps during the middle of the dry season (June/July) 2007, and a wide range of environmental variables was measured, covering vegetation and ground-layer structure, soil texture and chemistry, and time since fire. A total of 166 species from 33 genera were collected, with sample species richness ranging from 35 to 59 (mean 45.5) across the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4550276216167918176", "cites_id": ["4550276216167918176"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-010-9294-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YOqYNhzUJT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
