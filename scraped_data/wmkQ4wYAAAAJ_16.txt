Here we examine the latitudinal pattern of species richness across 1003 local ant assemblages. We find latitudinal asymmetry, with southern hemisphere sites being more diverse than northern hemisphere sites. Most of this asymmetry could be explained statistically by differences in contemporary climate. Local ant species richness was positively associated with temperature, but negatively (although weakly) associated with temperature range and precipitation. After contemporary climate was accounted for, a modest difference in diversity between hemispheres persisted, suggesting that factors other than contemporary climate contributed to the hemispherical asymmetry. The most parsimonious explanation for this remaining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 297, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9633659605926618060", "cites_id": ["9633659605926618060"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01291.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zCNJyl6isYUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 16, "2011": 25, "2012": 24, "2013": 17, "2014": 17, "2015": 20, "2016": 24, "2017": 26, "2018": 25, "2019": 27, "2020": 18, "2021": 22, "2022": 22, "2023": 11}}
