Effective ecosystem management, on the other hand, aims to maintain the diverse and dynamic ecosystems that underpin sustainable landuse, and is based on the principles of adaptive management. Many elements of the command-and-control culture prevail in contemporary fire management in northern Australia, with most fire managers focusing more on the implementation of particular management prescriptions (burning pat-terns) than on their success in meeting strategic ecological objectives, even in conservation areas, The dominant fire management paradigm in northern Australia is one of burning extensively early during the dry season, in order to limit the extent of \u201cuncontrolled wildfires' later in the dry season. While this may appear intuitively sensible, the ecological outcomes of such burning are rarely monitored, and there is little research into the effectiveness of alternative management systems. This is despite the widespread recognition that fire management is based on a poor understanding of the long-term ecological effects of different fire regimes. CSIRO recently conducted a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, designed to test the ecological effects of a range of contemporary fire regimes.Results from the experiment challenge some of the accepted beliefs that drive contemporary fire management. There is no fire regime that is universally beneficial, and effective fire management cannot proceed until clear and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=824512340263822335", "cites_id": ["824512340263822335"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Vardon/publication/273946128_Biology_in_the_wet-dry_tropics_still_wet_behind_the_ears_proceedings_of_a_symposium_held_at_the_Northern_Territory_University_Darwin_11th_July_1998/links/56de487d08aedf2bf0c87ade/Biology-in-the-wet-dry-tropics-still-wet-behind-the-ears-proceedings-of-a-symposium-held-at-the-Northern-Territory-University-Darwin-11th-July-1998.pdf#page=69", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_-NZ4ppBcQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
