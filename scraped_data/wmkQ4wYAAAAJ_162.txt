Termites are a conspicuous component of the soil fauna of tropical savannas, and are the premier decomposer insects. Unlike other decomposers, termites fundamentally alter the distribution of carbon and other nutrients, enriching the soils associated with their nests and mounds, and depleting soils elsewhere. Termites might also play a significant role in the global budgets of the \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gases carbon monoxide and methane. The key factors influencing habitat selection by vertebrates are considered to be moisture and nutrient availability, and fire. The responses of mammals, lizards and birds to a moisture gradient associated with seasonal creeklines is outlined.
