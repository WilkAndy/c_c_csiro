The predicted increases in atmospheric C02 concentration, rising sea levels, and changes in both temperature and rainfall regimes are all likely to affect the world's biota (IPCC, 1990). The aim of this paper is to discuss the possible responses of the biota of the tropical savannas of northern Australia to global atmospheric and climatic changes which are predicted to occur by 2050.The wet-dry tropics of northern Australia occupy about 30% of the continent (Figure 1). Rainfall in the region is highly seasonal, with a distinct summer maximum-the dry season is prolonged and drought is severe. The major land uses within this area include nature conservation, recreation, tourism, mining and pastoralism. The biota within this region, which has evolved in conjunction with stress and disturbance (Walker & Menaut, 1988), is diverse and has high conservation value. Our discussion centres on the tropical savannas of the northern section of the Northern Territory (12-18 S), which corresponds to the Darwin and Gulf, Victoria River and Barkly Tablelands districts of the Northern Territory (Bowman et al, 1988b). Special emphasis will be placed on the humid savannas of the coastal and sub-coastal regions, where rainfall is highest. Our scenarios for climate change are based on the recent CSIR04 General Circulation Model (GCM)(CSIRO, 1990), and are discussed for a range of scales from the sub-continental to the level of the plant community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12136934606292584677", "cites_id": ["12136934606292584677"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2h531urdOGAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA39&dq=info:5Qg3XrgNb6gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=wt5boPW2XO&sig=UxBfWhxqX5EUXVel5zMpr5jHP6U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Qg3XrgNb6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
