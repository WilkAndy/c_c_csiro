However, the extent of cross-taxon congruence in biotic responses to disturbance, and therefore the utility of using particular taxa as indicators of broader biotic responses, is poorly known. In this study, we examine the extent to which variation in alpha diversity, beta diversity and species composition of ants, fruit-feeding butterflies, dung beetles and termites in relation to fragment size are congruent in the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest. Our results show generally low and inconsistent congruence, typically occurring for particular pairs of taxa only (such as butterflies and dung beetles for species composition, and ants and termites for Hill diversity-1D) or not at all (such as for species richness). In synthesis, there some universal community-level attributes and taxa (i.e., attributes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6330037496167413265", "cites_id": ["6330037496167413265"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18308999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ETb2lZDP2FcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
