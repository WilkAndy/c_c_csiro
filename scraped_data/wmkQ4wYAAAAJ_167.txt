According to the habitat accommodation model, these changes drive a succession of animal species, which enter and leave according to their habitat requirements. While the response of ants to fire has been extensively studied, studies of ant communities in biomes with long fire-return intervals have been overwhelmingly short-term in nature. Here, we explore the response of ant species, functional groups and communities to time since fire using a uniquely long-term (>300 years) chronosequence in eucalypt woodlands of south-western Australia. Marked non-monotonic vegetation structural changes occur in non-resprouting Eucalyptus salubris-dominated woodlands following fire, with tree and ground fuel cover peaking at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3867321724235363491", "cites_id": ["3867321724235363491"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112715000080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ozQzRZ58qzUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
