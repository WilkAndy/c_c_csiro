The composition of the assemblage of captured skinks was not significantly affected by fire, and no change in total abundance of skinks was recorded. Arthropods constitute the principal food of the skinks and the composition of the captured arthropod samples on the treatment plots was significantly affected by the fires, with spiders, beetles and hemipterans increasing in numbers during the immediate post-fire period. Seasonal changes in captured skink assemblage composition, unrelated to the fire event, occurred between the wet\u2013dry season transition and the early dry season. These changes were associated with variation in four weather variables and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12540096332954732020", "cites_id": ["12540096332954732020"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/WR05067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9AXyrixfB64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
