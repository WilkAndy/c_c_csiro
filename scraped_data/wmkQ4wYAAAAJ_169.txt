Its ant fauna was sampled with pitfall traps following the procedure used by Andersen and Majer (in press) at 8 vine thickets in the northwest Kimberley region. A total of 23 species were recorded, with the tropical tramp species Paratrechina longicornis comprising 55% of total captures. As was the case in the northwest Kimberley, arid-adapted taxa of the surrounding savanna (eg species of Iridomyrmex, Melophorus, Meranoplus) were poorly represented, and two unspecialized functional groups ('opportunists' and generalized myrmicines\") predominated. Compared with the ants of related habitats in the northwest Kimberley, those of the Broome vine thicket appear to have little biogeographic significance, and the predominance of P. longicornis is indicative of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16493824779105317048", "cites_id": ["16493824779105317048"], "pub_url": "https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/d/de/Andersen,_A.N._&_Burbidge,_A.H._1991.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uLAboj_W5eQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
