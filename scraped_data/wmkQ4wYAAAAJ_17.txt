Given the overwhelmingly dominant contribution of invertebrates to biodiversity, no biodiversity monitoring programme can be considered credible if invertebrates are not addressed effectively. Here we review the use of terrestrial invertebrates, with a particular focus on ants, as bioindicators in Australia in the context of monitoring biodiversity in Australia's rangelands. Ant monitoring systems in Australia were initially developed for assessing restoration success following mining, and have since been applied to a wide range of other land\u2010use situations, including grazing impacts in rangelands. The use of ants as bioindicators in Australia is supported by an extensive portfolio of studies of the responses of ant communities to disturbance, as well as by a global model of ant community dynamics based on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 278, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4130778744775577610", "cites_id": ["4130778744775577610"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01362.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ChAV8GF5UzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 7, "2005": 13, "2006": 13, "2007": 15, "2008": 14, "2009": 16, "2010": 22, "2011": 19, "2012": 21, "2013": 16, "2014": 7, "2015": 21, "2016": 12, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 13, "2022": 10}}
