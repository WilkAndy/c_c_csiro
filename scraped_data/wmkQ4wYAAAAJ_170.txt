Here we use a collection developed from 3 decades of ant surveys to present the first analysis of ant diversity and biogeography of a large tropical region. Our objective was to document the species richness, composition, and biogeographic distributions of the ant fauna of the 400 000 km2 \u201cTop End\u201d of Australia's Northern Territory. The known Top End ant fauna comprises 901 native species from 59 genera. The richest genera are Pheidole (90 species), Melophorus (83), Monomorium (83), Camponotus (71), Meranoplus (63), Polyrhachis (57), Rhytidoponera (50), Tetramorium (43), Cerapachys (32), and Iridomyrmex (31). The fauna is the center of diverse radiations within species\u2010groups of genera such as Meranoplus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6846228131860768984", "cites_id": ["6846228131860768984"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1744-7917.12402", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2OjYijawAl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
