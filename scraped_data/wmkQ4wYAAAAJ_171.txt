This study documents the impacts of invasion by the exotic cat\u2019s claw creeper vine, Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) Gentry (Bignoniaceae) on surface-situated (epigaeic) and subterranean (hypogaeic) ant communities in subtropical SE Queensland Australia where it is a major environmental weed of riparian areas, rainforest communities and remnant natural vegetation, smothering standing vegetation and causing canopy collapse. Soil ants were sampled in infested and uninfested areas at eight sites spanning both riparian and non-riparian habitats in subtropical SE Queensland. Patterns of ant species composition and functional grouping in response to patch invasion status, landscape type and habitat stratum were investigated using ANOVA and non-metric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16869178357010368888", "cites_id": ["16869178357010368888"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-011-0040-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eIlPxlZcG-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
