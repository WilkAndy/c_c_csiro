The Tiwi Islands are located 20 km off the mainland coast near Darwin in northern Northern Territory, and include Australia's second largest insular landmass after Tasmania. The islands receive the highest mean annual rainfall (up to 2000 mm) in monsoonal northern Australia, and they are the closest part of the Australian landmass to south-east Asia. On the basis of ~1300 species records, we list 154 species (including nine introduced) from 34 genera. The richest genera are Polyrhachis (20 species), Monomorium (15), Camponotus (14), Pheidole (12), and Iridomyrmex (11). In all, 66% of the native Tiwi species belong to Torresian (tropical) species groups, which is considerably higher than the 44% for Australia's monsoonal ant fauna as a whole.
