The richest genera were Camponotus (15 species), Iridomyrmex (10), Melophorus (12), Monomorium (10), Pheidole (8), Meranoplus (6) and Polyrhachis (6). Twenty\u2010nine of the species have Eyrean affinities, 15 Torresian, and five Bassian, with the remaining 47 representing widespread taxa. Species turnover was very high across the sites sampled, with 69 (72%) recorded at only one site. Almost all the species that could be confidently named, including Myrmecia varians Mayr, Anochetus armstrongi McAreavey, Brachyponera lutea (Mayr), Iridomyrmexpurpureus (F. Smith), I. sanguineus Forel, Camponotus dromas Santschi, C. ephippium (F.
