Here, we evaluate the effect of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., firewood collection, livestock grazing) and vegetation seasonality on foraging area, foliage availability in the foraging area, leaf consumption and herbivory rate of the leaf\u2010cutting ant Atta opaciceps in the semiarid Caatinga, a mosaic of dry forest and scrub vegetation in northeast Brazil. Contrary to our initial expectation, the foraging area was not affected by either disturbance intensity or the interaction between season and disturbance intensity. However, leaf consumption and herbivory rate were higher in more disturbed areas. We also found a strong effect of seasonality, with higher leaf consumption and herbivory rate in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=863782387170340959", "cites_id": ["863782387170340959"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12599", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X_CGLoHF_AsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
