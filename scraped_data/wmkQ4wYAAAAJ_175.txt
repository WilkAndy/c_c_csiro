To date, there have been numerous studies of niche differentiation in local ant communities, but little attention has been given to the macroecology of niche differentiation, including the extent to which particular biomes show distinctive patterns of niche structure across their global ranges. We investigated patterns of niche differentiation and competition in ant communities in tropical rainforests, using different baits reflecting the natural food spectrum. We examined the extent of temporal and dietary niche differentiation and spatial segregation of ant communities at five rainforest sites in the neotropics, paleotropics, and tropical Australia. Despite high niche overlap, we found significant dietary and temporal niche differentiation in every site. However, there was no spatial segregation among \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6701001607233781062", "cites_id": ["6701001607233781062"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.5394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rr19VnW9_lwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
