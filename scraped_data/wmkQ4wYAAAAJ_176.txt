In these places, fire is an important tool for habitat management at the landscape scale (Gill 1977; Moore 1987; Morton and Andrew 1987). Nowhere is fire more a part of the ecological and cultural landscape than in tropical savannas (Dyer et al. 2001). Characterized by a continuous grass layer under a sparse canopy of trees, savannas are the dominant ecosystems throughout the tropics wherever rainfall is highly seasonal (Bourli\u00e8re 1983). Grass fires are an inevitable part of the annual cycle of profuse herbaceous production during the wet season (Fig. 1.1), followed by seasonal drought lasting for up to 7 months. Savannas have experienced frequent fires throughout their evolutionary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4010233498095603252", "cites_id": ["4010233498095603252"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-21515-8_1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NE5ckB42pzcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
