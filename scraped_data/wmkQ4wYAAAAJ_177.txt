This study of the grasshoppers (Orthoptera : Acrididae, Eumastacidae, Pyrgomorphidae, Tridactylidae, Tetrigidae and Tettigoniidae) of Kakadu National Park in the seasonal tropics of the Northern Territory is the first comprehensive description of any regional grasshopper fauna in Australia. We list all known species, describe their biogeography, habitat associations and abundance, and propose a functional group classification for Australian grasshoppers as a framework for future ecological and biogeographical studies. In all, 161 grasshopper species from 90 genera are known from Kakadu. The dominant family is Acrididae (64% of all genera, 63% of all species), within which the subfamily Catantopinae (44% of all grasshopper genera, 47% species) is particularly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16959809982518510386", "cites_id": ["16959809982518510386"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/zo00039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MsMjelJZXesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
