At Danggali, ants were sampled by a total of 1,160 pitfall traps, located within 18 1\u2010km2 plots distributed across the Park to cover a broad range of habitats and fire histories. A total of 248 species from 32 genera were collected, with the richest genera being Camponotus (51 species), Melophorus (37), Iridomyrmex (29), and Monomorium (24). Overall generic composition was very similar to that at both Wyperfeld and Cape Arid, but the representation of Bassian species\u2010groups was substantially lower at Danggali (19% of total species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8928383665844036471", "cites_id": ["8928383665844036471"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1996.tb01405.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d6MItaP953sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
