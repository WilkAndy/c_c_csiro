Ants were surveyed at 15 sites, primarily by pitfall trapping, during November 1988 and April 1989, with 141 species from 29 genera being recorded. Faunistic composition, in terms of the biogeographical affinities of species, the distribution of species across genera, the composition of species-groups within major genera, and the distribution of species across functional groups, was similar to that at Wyperfeld. Many species were common to both locations. The richest genera were Camponotus (28 species), Iridomyrmex (24 species) and Melophorus (15 species), as is typical ofarid Australia. However, as is also the case at Wyperfeld, these genera included elements characteristic of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5698465537440236548", "cites_id": ["5698465537440236548"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/37779417/Andersen___Burbidge_1992.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BETu6zYEFU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
