The model has provided valuable support to the widespread use of ant communities as bioindicators of ecological change. However, the model was developed from studies of arid-zone faunas, and its applicability to the World Heritage rainforests of Queensland's humid tropics has not yet been validated. Here we test predictions based on the functional group model for ant communities in Queensland's humid rainforests, by documenting ant community composition and its responses to disturbance on the Atherton Tablelands. Five sites were studied, comprising two relatively undisturbed reference sites representing contrasting rainforest types, and three previously cleared sites, two of which were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3937761698317105182", "cites_id": ["3937761698317105182"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008857214743", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HnhUxma9pTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 10, "2005": 7, "2006": 10, "2007": 11, "2008": 8, "2009": 22, "2010": 18, "2011": 23, "2012": 15, "2013": 16, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 5, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
