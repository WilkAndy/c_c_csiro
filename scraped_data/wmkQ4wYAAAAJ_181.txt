We assess patterns of ant species and functional diversity, their environmental predictors, and biogeographic significance in the central North Kimberley region of Australia\u2019s seasonal tropics. Pitfall traps were used to sample ants at 69 plots in representative savanna habitats, collecting a total of 158 species from 30 genera. Total richness was estimated to be as high as 237 species. At least 29 species across 12 genera appear to have been collected for the first time. Only a single invasive ant was recorded from the study area. Based on cluster analysis we identified six compositionally distinct ant communities, each associated with a combination of vegetation type and underlying geology.
