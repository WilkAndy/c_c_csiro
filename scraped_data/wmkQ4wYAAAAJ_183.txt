The behaviourally dominant ants in these habitats are typically dolichoderines, notably species of Iridomyrmex in the Australian arid zone (Greenslade 1976), species of Anonychomyrma, Philidris, and Do-lichoderus in the Old World tropics (Huxley 1982; where Philidris is referred to as the cor-datus group of Iridomyrmex), and species of Azteca, Dolichoderus, Linepithema, Liometo-pum, Dorymyrmex, and Forelius in the New World (Andersen 1995; Davidson 1997; Tobin 1994). It should, however, be noted that not all dolichoderines are behaviourally dominant, with many being behaviourally submissive Opportunists (see Table 8.2. 1). temperate regions elsewhere in the world. In these regions, behavioural dominance has evolved in Cold-Climate Specialist formicines, such as Formica (rufa and exsecta groups) throughout the Holarctic, and Anoplolepis (custodiens group) in southern Africa. No such behaviourally dominant, cold-adapted formicine occurs in Australia. Behavioural dominance also occurs in the arboreal Tropical-Climate Specialist Oecophylla, which occurs throughout the Old World Tropics; it has no parallel in the New World Tropics. Subdominant Generalized Myrmicinae have a much broader distribution in relation to environmental stress and disturbance than do Dominant Dolichoderinae, and tend to predominate in moderately, rather than highly, productive environments for ants (Andersen 1995). They are often extremely successful at recruiting to and defending food resources, but compared with Dominant Dolichoderinae have lower rates of activity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13161611610221860742", "cites_id": ["13161611610221860742"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vlwVDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA142&dq=info:hlfuugZwp7YJ:scholar.google.com&ots=aVuZzjwgEj&sig=KCnzYwxv5BBAf0M1gZgOh9-wq00", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hlfuugZwp7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
