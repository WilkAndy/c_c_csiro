Here we examine one such mechanism, high adult survival during fire, for three perennial grass species in an Australian savanna: Eriachne triseta Nees ex Steud, Eriachne avenacea R.Br and Chrysopogon latifolius S.T.Blake. The study examined survivorship after 3\u2003years, at plots subject to experimental fire regimes (experiencing 0, 1, 2 or 3 fires over the study period) at the Territory Wildlife Park near Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. Mean survivorship was 79.9%, 64.3% and 62.0% for E. avenacea, E. triseta and C. latifolius respectively. For the two species of Eriachne, mean survivorship was highest (E. avenacea, 94.6%; E. triseta, 77.1%) in unburnt plots, whereas survivorship of C. latifolius was highest (71.7%) under highest fire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2235199419371248940", "cites_id": ["2235199419371248940"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.02091.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LF3IgQcGBR8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
