Since different species of ants often require similar food, nesting and foraging conditions, they often interact strongly with each other, and as a result diverse assemblages of ants tend to form wellintegrated communities. The question of species coexistence has long interested ecologists how is it that different species with similar ecological requirements are able to coexist? This question is particularly relevant to the diverse ant communities of the Victorian mallee, where more than 150 species can be found in an area less than 1 ha. The answer to species co-existence in communities such as these lies in the ability of different species to avoid competition with each other. They are able to do this because of differences in diet (ants may avoid competition with each other by specializing on different types of food, such as seeds or particular insect prey; and for species which eat similar food types, differences in body size often result in differences in the size of food items taken), habitat preferences (different species may occupy different parts of the habitat), and time of foraging (different species often forage at different times of the day and at different times of the year). PJM Greenslade has recently developed a scheme for analysing the structure of the diverse ant communities characteristic of semi-arid southern Australia, and this scheme focusses on the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7823125188997909227", "cites_id": ["7823125188997909227"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7823125188997909227&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:64qhI-lSkWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 4, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
