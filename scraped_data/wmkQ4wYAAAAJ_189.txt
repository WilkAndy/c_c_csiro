A recent study of the ant fauna of the Mitchell Falls area of the northern Kimberley revealed that 44 % of the species are known only from the Kimberley region. The fauna appeared to be highly resilient in relation to fire. Levels of endemism in the Mitchell Falls region are likely to be particularly high because it occurs in a high rainfall zone (>1,200 mm per year) that is isolated from similar zones elsewhere in northern Australia. In contrast, the lower rainfall eastern and southern Kimberley form part of continuous climatic bands that extend right across northern Australia, and so species from these areas might be expected to be more widely distributed. Here we describe the ant fauna of Mirima \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4822432536926221321", "cites_id": ["4822432536926221321"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-014-9624-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CfTFjNe47EIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
