Timor is of outstanding biogeographical significance because it is the second largest island within the Wallacean transitional zone between the closely approximated but geologically distinct Indo-Australasian and South East Asian continental plates. It represents a potential overlap zone between the otherwise disjunct ant faunas of Australia and South East Asia. A total of 154 ant species from 32 genera and six subfamilies were collected through a combination of systematic sampling in evergreen forest, dry forest, savanna and grassland at 23 locations in the Lautem district of Timor-Leste, and opportunistic collections at 29 sites elsewhere on Timor and on the neighbouring islands.
