However, there is limited information on the effects of buffel grass invasion on native fauna. We used an experimental approach to investigate the impact of buffel grass on the native ant fauna near Alice Springs in semi-arid central Australia. A series of plots where buffel grass was removed and native vegetation had regenerated (B\u2212), paired with adjacent control plots heavily invaded by buffel grass (B+), were used to assess the impact of buffel grass on ant diversity and composition, and on rates of seed dispersal by ants. Differences in ant diversity were also compared between two microhabitat types: bare ground and under cover, to examine the extent to which any impacts were a simple function of change in vegetation cover.
