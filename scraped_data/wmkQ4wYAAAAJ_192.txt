In general, the ant fauna comprised generalist species widespread on the north Australian mainland. The functional group composition was also comparable to that of similar environments on the north Australian mainland. The ant fauna was not tightly structured. There were few habitat specialists, no species showed a clear preference for smaller islands, and only a few species showed unequivocal preferences for larger islands. There were no clear cases of congeneric, or otherwise ecologically similar, species replacing each other on different islands. In contrast to the north Australian mainland, there were no significant differences between habitats in ant species richness. However, the functional group composition varied significantly between the eight main \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11505133059282057458", "cites_id": ["11505133059282057458"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ZO/ZO98012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8jgchI9xqp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
