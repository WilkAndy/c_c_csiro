Herbarium records sample diversity well at regional level and are taxonomically validated. However, they are ad hoc from a sampling perspective, generating spatial and taxonomic biases. The implications of biased sampling on beta diversity (\u03b2) estimation, and use of herbarium data to identify macroecological transitions, remain unexplored. We tested sampling influences by comparing herbarium data with systematically collected inventory data from the Mount Lofty\u2013Flinders Ranges region of Australia. We calculated \u03b2 within moving windows across bioclimatic gradients using metrics varying in sensitivity to richness differences (pairwise/multi\u2010site S\u00f8rensen \u03b2; Simpson \u03b2; Harrison et al. \u03b2\u20102), and correlated \u03b2 to species sampling and between herbarium and plot data.
