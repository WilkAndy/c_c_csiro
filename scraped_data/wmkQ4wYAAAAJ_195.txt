Here, we address this issue in Brazilian savanna and tested three predictions: (i) Trees with EFN have higher richness of arboreal ant species than trees without; (ii) Arboreal ant species richness increases with the proportion of total EFN\u2010bearing trees at the site scale, due to a higher occurrence of non\u2010core ant species; (iii) Ant species composition changes with the proportion of EFN\u2010bearing trees at the site scale. We sampled arboreal ants in 32 plots with EFN\u2010bearing trees ranging from 0% to 60% of all trees. We sampled 72 ant species, from which 17 (mostly belonging to Camponotus, Cephalotes and Crematogaster) were identified as core species in at least one of the ant\u2010EFN networks in the 32 plots. Ant species richness was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2390752436980658438", "cites_id": ["2390752436980658438"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12612", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BrEhuKyoLSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
