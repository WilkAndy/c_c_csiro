Although tropical ant faunas have long been known to show strong vertical stratification, only recently has it been recognised that this can include a high diversity of subterranean species that are poorly sampled using traditional methods. Global diversity patterns of subterranean ants and their responses to above-ground disturbance remain largely unknown. We describe ants collected in 360 subterranean traps distributed across 15 sites representing contrasting soil types (volcano-sedimentary and ultramafic) in New Caledonia, a recognised Global Biodiversity hotspot. New Caledonia has a diverse above-ground ant fauna that includes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15112847006744880544", "cites_id": ["15112847006744880544"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0309-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oKXaBUieu9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
