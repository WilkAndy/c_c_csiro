This fauna features shade-tolerant taxa of Indo-Malayan origin, in contrast to the arid-adapted, endemic Australian taxa that dominate the surrounding savanna. The Tiwi Islands north of Darwin in the Northern Territory (NT) receive the highest mean annual rainfall (up to 2,000 mm) in monsoonal Australia, and have a particularly extensive rainforest estate that has been poorly surveyed for invertebrates. Here we describe results from intensive ant surveys at 17 sites representing the full range of Tiwi rainforest types, using subterranean traps, Winkler sacs, pitfall traps and arboreal traps, supplemented by opportunistic hand collections. Our surveys yielded a total of 87 species from 37 genera, with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13756734498819249669", "cites_id": ["13756734498819249669"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-012-0238-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BZZ77yO96b4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
