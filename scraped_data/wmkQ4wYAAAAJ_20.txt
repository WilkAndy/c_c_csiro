The data used were published records of species and genus richness from 24 sites distributed throughout the country. The relationship between species and genus richness was strong within regions, but varied substantially between regions, such that overall it had poor predictive power. The relationship was also confounded by biogeographic factors, and strongly influenced by sampling intensity and sampling area. Except in limited circumstances, genus richness therefore appears to be an unreliable surrogate for species richness in local Australian ant faunas. This may apply more generally to taxa in which a relatively small number of genera can contribute a large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13740848342904110500", "cites_id": ["13740848342904110500"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320795900594", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pH1QB8RMsb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 8, "1997": 6, "1998": 6, "1999": 10, "2000": 11, "2001": 4, "2002": 7, "2003": 10, "2004": 7, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 9, "2008": 11, "2009": 13, "2010": 17, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
