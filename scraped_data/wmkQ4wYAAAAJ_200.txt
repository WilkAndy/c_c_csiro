Of the approximately 1.4 million described species of all living organisms, more than half are insects (Wilson 1986). Given that most insect species are undescribed\u2014one estimate is that there are actually 30 million species (Erwin 1983)\u2014this is a very conservative measure of the contribution of insects to global biodiversity. Despite the great diversity and functional importance of savanna insects, they have received little attention by savanna ecologists, particularly in Australia (Andersen and Lonsdale 1990). Insects play three broad ecological roles in tropical savannas, as they do in most terrestrial ecosystems. Insects are (1) ecosystem engineers, particularly through their effects on soil properties and processes,(2) regulators of plant populations through herbivory, seed predation, and other direct interactions with plants, and (3) drivers of consumer food webs, as competitors, predators, parasites, and prey. These roles provide a basis for the use of insects in savanna management, as bioindicators of ecosystem health (Disney 1986; Rosenberg et al. 1986; Kremen 1992; Milton and Dean 1992; Andersen 1999c), and as weed biocontrol agents (Julien 1987;"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18063260595920713465", "cites_id": ["18063260595920713465"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=R2UKBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=info:-TYqCc-XrfoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=SrbRYzlbT5&sig=1poPzEB7KjifP-QCnKjX8y7Mzvw", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-TYqCc-XrfoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
