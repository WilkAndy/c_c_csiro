Such analyses need to consider thermal gradients at multiple spatial scales. Here we relate thermal traits of rainforest ants to microclimate conditions from ground to canopy (microgeographic scale) along an elevation gradient (mesogeographic scale) and calculate warming tolerance to assess climate change vulnerability in the Australian Wet Tropics Bioregion. We test the thermal adaptation and thermal niche asymmetry hypotheses to explain interspecific patterns of thermal tolerance at these two spatial scales. We tested cold tolerance (CTmin), heat tolerance (CTmax), and calculated thermal tolerance range (CTrange), using ramping assays for 74 colonies of 40 ant species collected from terrestrial and arboreal habitats at lowland and upland \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9181877809813382841", "cites_id": ["9181877809813382841"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3549", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ueb3aDiVbH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 7}}
