Conservation planning for fauna is therefore often based on patterns of diversity and distribution of vertebrates, under the assumption that these are representative of animal diversity more generally. Here, we evaluate how well vertebrates act as umbrellas for invertebrate diversity and distribution in a highly diverse tropical savanna landscape, and we investigate the effect of vertebrate sampling intensity (i.e., number of surveys) on congruence results. We assessed congruence between each of the four classes of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and twelve invertebrate families (representing four dominant invertebrate taxa: ants, beetles, flies, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5475860490803442061", "cites_id": ["5475860490803442061"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2755", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jXHvoRoq_ksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
