This study employed an extensive sampling of mostly Australian taxa, along with exemplars of other genera of Solenopsidini, to examine relationships among the continent\u2019s Monomorium fauna. Sequences from elongation factor 1\u03b1 F2, wingless and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) were analysed using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. The resultant phylogeny resolved Australian Monomorium into two major clades separated by exemplars from other genera; one comprised predominantly species with 11-segmented antennae (corresponding to Monomorium s. str. in a recent study of Myrmicinae) along with three Paleotropical species. The second clade included Australian species with 12-segmented antennae \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6997625855726941223", "cites_id": ["6997625855726941223"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/IS/IS16080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J3SxCaSPHGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
