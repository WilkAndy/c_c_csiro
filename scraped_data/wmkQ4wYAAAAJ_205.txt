Lasius flavus activity has been shown to change the amounts of plant nutrients in their mound soil substrate. It is unknown how the maturity of such mounds influences nutrient status and affects plant growth.We quantified bulk soil and extractable nutrient contents of three mound development stages (young, middle-aged and fully-developed) in comparison to the surrounding soil (control), and in a bioassay using species of three plant functional types (grass, non nitrogen (N)-fixing forb, N-fixing forb) linked these to plant growth and chemistry.Our results showed that development stage was an important predictor of a mound's nutritional status. Lasius flavus activity results in decreases in bulk soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, sulfur, extractable manganese and zinc, and increases in bulk soil clay, pH, base \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16071949606169257465", "cites_id": ["16071949606169257465"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S116455631730136X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-aWykwMJC98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
