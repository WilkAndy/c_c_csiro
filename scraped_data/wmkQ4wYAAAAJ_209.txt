Harvester ants are major seed predators in arid environments. However, given that many harvester ants are partly omnivorous and therefore potentially attracted to the elaiosomes of myrmecochorous seeds, it is unclear if these ants act as predators or dispersers when removing myrmecochorous seeds.2. We describe the outcomes of interactions between the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex naegelii, and myrmecochorous plant, Microstachys serrulata, in a Brazilian savanna. We: (i) evaluated the role of elaiosome in seed removal by P. naegelii; (ii) investigated the fate and viability of removed seeds; (iii) tested if soils associated with P. naegelii nests are nutrient\u2010enriched; (iv) compared seedling survival; and (v) the density of seedling and adult M. serrulata nearby to P. naegelii nests compared with those away from these nests (i.e. controls).3. Rates of removal of M. serrulata seeds were two\u2010fold higher with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7604230038013557438", "cites_id": ["7604230038013557438"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/een.12885", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vjonPu6mh2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
