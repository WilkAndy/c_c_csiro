This study assesses the usefulness of sampling invertebrate by-catch from standard vertebrate bucket pitfall traps for documenting spatial patterns of terrestrial invertebrates. We compare among-site (N\u2009=\u200978) patterns of species richness and composition of ten invertebrate families (comprising ants, beetles and spiders) captured in vertebrate bucket traps with those captured in two different arrays of invertebrate-specific pitfall traps. For three families (Formicidae, Carabidae and Lycosidae) patterns of richness and composition captured in the vertebrate traps were comparable with those captured in the invertebrate-specific trap arrays. Thus, in some cases, vertebrate traps appeared to be as useful in detecting patterns of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7182788744388601487", "cites_id": ["7182788744388601487"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10841-019-00143-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j-b0lU5krmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
