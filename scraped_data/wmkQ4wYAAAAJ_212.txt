A particularly challenging issue is that the same type and intensity of disturbance can have different impacts in different habitats. We investigate how habitat contingency influences ant community responses to disturbance in arid Australia, testing the hypothesis that disturbance has a greater impact in more complex habitats. We also assess the effectiveness of a highly simplified ant assessment protocol that considers larger species only. We sampled ants at 46 sites from two habitats (Chandler, low chenopod shrubland; and mulga, low woodland) with contrasting complexity, using distance from water as a surrogate for variation in grazing intensity. We assessed variation in habitat structural variables (basal area of perennial grass, and cover of herbs, litter, and bare ground) and ant communities in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13904859867114255", "cites_id": ["13904859867114255"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1770", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D-sHeWVmMQAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
