These ants were collected in Australia from western New South Wales, northern Queensland, and northern Northern Territory. Additionally, samples from the M. sordidum complex and M. carinatum complex were examined. Thirteen previously described trans\u20102,5\u2010dialkylpyrrolidines were detected in these ants, along with the novel trans\u20102\u2010ethyl\u20105\u2010[(Z)\u2010tridec\u20104\u2010enyl]pyrrolidine (6), whose structure was confirmed by synthesis. The extent of variation and the correlation observed in the morphology and venom chemistry in M. rothsteini samples is very strongly indicative of multiple species in this complex. The presence and location of the C\uf8feC bond in 6 reinforces the remarkable structural similarity of the 2\u2010ethylpyrrolidines in these Monomorium species to the 2\u2010methylpiperidines in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11866574500372183294", "cites_id": ["11866574500372183294"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbdv.200900005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_nhk46KKrqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
