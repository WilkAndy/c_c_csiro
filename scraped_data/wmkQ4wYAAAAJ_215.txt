Myrmecochorous plants have specially adapted seeds that possess a food appendage designed for ant attraction and transport (van der Pijl, 1982; Beattie, 1985). The appendages are typically arils, ariloides or caruncles (Gorb & Gorb, 2003), and are collectively referred to as elaiosomes because they are all rich in fatty acids. Generalized omnivorous ants are attracted to the elaiosomes and use them as handles for seed transportation (Beattie, 1985). Once seeds reach the nest, ants eat the elaiosome and typically discard the seed intact, in nest galleries or externally on nest middens or nearby refuse dumps, where they can potentially germinate and establish (Beattie, 1985; Hughes & Westoby, 1992; Manzaneda & Rey, 2012). Myrmecochory is particularly common among temperate forest herbs in the northern Hemisphere (Beattie & Culver, 1981; Gorb & Gorb, 2003) and sclerophyll shrubs of Mediterranean-climate landscapes in South Africa, southern Australia and southern Europe (Bond & Slingsby, 1983; Westoby et al., 1991; Garrido et al.,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2133105341585940013", "cites_id": ["2133105341585940013"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=liAzDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA112&dq=info:Ld63qQFQmh0J:scholar.google.com&ots=IAwe-Uy7hI&sig=6m5iKa53JJbFJhyoY1XUanLKPsM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ld63qQFQmh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
