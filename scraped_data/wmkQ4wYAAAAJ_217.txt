Here, we investigate how habitat fragmentation affects extrafloral nectary (EFN)\u2010bearing plants and ant functional groups known to attend EFNs in a fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest. Extrafloral nectary\u2010bearing trees were identified in 50 0.1\u2010ha plots located in forest fragments, edge and interior patches. Ants were surveyed in 30 1\u2010m2 litter samples in each of 17 forest fragments and in forest interior. Extrafloral nectary\u2010bearing plants accounted for 19.9% of individuals and 10.5% of species and included both pioneer and shade\u2010tolerant species similarly rich in the three habitat types. However, shade\u2010tolerant individuals accounted for >80% of EFN\u2010bearing plants in forest interior, compared with 2% in forest edge and 29% in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4921241503812739260", "cites_id": ["4921241503812739260"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vOCq6BLDS0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
