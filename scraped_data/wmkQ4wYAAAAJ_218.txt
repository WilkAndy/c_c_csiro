Savanna burning also makes a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, through its effects on emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, and on carbon sequestration. There is growing international interest in reducing the extent and severity of savanna fires in the context of greenhouse gas abatement. Fire management for greenhouse gas abatement is a particularly important issue for northern Australia, where the burning of> 400 000 km2 each year contributes on average 3% of Australia\u2019s accountable greenhouse gas emissions. Most of these emissions are produced by relatively highintensity wildfires that sweep through remote and unmanaged areas during the end of the dry season, and which seriously threaten iconic biodiversity values such as those of World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park. Greenhouse gas abatement provides an economic basis for improved fire management in these remote areas. It also presents important livelihood opportunities for remote Aboriginal communities, where traditional knowledge relating to fire remains strong, as does the desire to re-establish traditional fire management practices on their homelands. Savanna burning, therefore, sees an unprecedented meeting of interests relating to biodiversity protection, greenhouse gas abatement, and culturally appropriate economic opportunity for historically marginalized communities. This calls for an interdisciplinary understanding of fire in savanna landscapes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12851039689400030851", "cites_id": ["12851039689400030851"], "pub_url": "https://ava.icmbio.gov.br/pluginfile.php/4592/mod_data/content/20375/2012-Savanna_burning_The_ecology_and_economy_of_fire_in_tropical_savannas.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g5YigYIQWLIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
