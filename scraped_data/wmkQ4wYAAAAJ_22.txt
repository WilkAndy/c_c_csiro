Here we describe the first experimental test of their influence on other ant species, and one of the first experimental studies of the influence of a dominant species on any diverse ant community. The study was conducted at a 0.4 ha savanna woodland site in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia, where the northern meat ant (I. sanguineus) represented 41% of pitfall catches and 73% of all ants at tuna baits, despite a total of 74 species being recorded. Meat ants were fenced out of experimental plots in order to test their influence on the foraging success of other species, as measured by access to tuna baits. The numbers of all other ants and ant species at baits in exclusion plots were approximately double those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 237, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15658200021008043745", "cites_id": ["15658200021008043745"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/4220661", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4c4yWvUZTdkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 10, "1997": 8, "1998": 12, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 10, "2005": 7, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 13, "2011": 11, "2012": 10, "2013": 14, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
