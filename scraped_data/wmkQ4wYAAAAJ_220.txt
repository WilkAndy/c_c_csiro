Here we assess both the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on rain forest ant communities, where substantial shifts are projected to occur for both climate and habitat types.Australian Wet Tropics (AWT).Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was used to model turnover in the composition of ~300 rain forest ant species sampled at 150 sites across six mountains spanning five degrees of latitude. Ants were sampled within the leaf litter, on the litter surface and on tree trunks. By modelling the rate of turnover among sites, we determined the current effective area of similar ecological environments (SEE) for ant communities and consequently the expected change in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16100860004977282130", "cites_id": ["16100860004977282130"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ugz3Vt6-cd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
