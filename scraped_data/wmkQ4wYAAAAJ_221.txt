Harvester ants are the dominant post-dispersal seed predators in Australia\u2019s tropical savannas, and their abundance and foraging efficiency, as well as the availability of seed and microsites, are affected by fire history. We undertook a predator-exclusion experiment to examine the interactive effects of fire history (no fire compared with annual burning over 5 years) and seed predation by ants on seedling establishment of the dominant savanna tree, Eucalyptus miniata, in northern Australia. Despite its large seed size, the rate of removal (~ 20\u201360%) was similar or higher than typically reported for eucalypts, although it was lower than that recorded for the smaller seeds of the co-occurring E \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16116067131023214149", "cites_id": ["16116067131023214149"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-018-4061-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rcb8SKvFp98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
