Invertebrates also play dominant roles in the functioning of ecosystems, maintaining healthy soils, driving nutrient cycling and energy flow, and regulating plant productivity and reproduction (Wilson 1987). Despite this, invertebrates generally attract little attention in conservation management.Kakadu National Park harbours many thousands of insect species, with some having high public profiles. These include the striking Leichhardt\u2019s grasshopper (Petasida epiphiggera), one of Australia\u2019s most colourful insects and of high cultural significance for local Aboriginal people (Figure 4.1), and the Cathedral termite (Nasutitermes triodiae), whose spectacular mounds are a prominent feature of Kakadu\u2019s savanna landscapes (Figure 4.2). Some aquatic species, such as cherabin (Macrobrachium spp.), crayfish (Cherax spp.), crabs (Austrothelphusa spp.) and freshwater mussels (Velesunio angasi), are important food sources for local Aboriginal communities. However, the vast majority of invertebrate species in Kakadu are poorly known even by specialist scientists, and it is likely that a substantial proportion has not yet even been collected. The major processes that threaten Kakadu\u2019s plants and vertebrates\u2013inappropriate fire regimes, weeds, feral animals and climate change\u2013all have potentially important influences on invertebrate species. However, for all but the most common and conspicuous species, there is simply insufficient information available for assessing their conservation status. Largely because of this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9766148759834262931", "cites_id": ["9766148759834262931"], "pub_url": "https://nesplandscapes.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4.1.28_kakadu_national_park_landscape_symposia_series.pdf#page=57", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k_2KxY1UiIcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
