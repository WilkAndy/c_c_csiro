According to the most recent taxonomic revision, many Australian species are characterised by very broad distributions and variable morphology, which suggests that some species may be unrecognised species complexes. With a continent\u2010wide distribution and diverse yet overlapping morphology, M.\u2009rothsteini (Forel) is representative of the greater challenge that exists in Australian Monomorium systematics. Here we investigate species boundaries in M.\u2009rothsteini using a molecular phylogenetic framework to interpret the complex overlap of nine morphological characters (with 31 states) and examine biogeographic relationships among the lineages. Bayesian inference resolved 38 mtDNA lineages that were morphologically separable, at least from their sister lineage.
