We test this hypothesis by statistically modelling the vertical and elevation distributions and microclimate exposure of rainforest ants.Wet Tropics Bioregion, Australia.We conducted 60 ground\u2010to\u2010canopy surveys to determine the vertical (tree) and elevation distributions, and microclimate exposure of ants (101 species) at 15 sites along four mountain ranges. We statistically modelled elevation range size as a function of ant species\u2019 vertical niche breadth and exposure to temperature variance for 55 species found at two or more trees.We found a positive association between vertical niche and elevation range of ant species: for every 3 m increase in vertical niche breadth, our models predict a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10215607511494816574", "cites_id": ["10215607511494816574"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13210", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PvN1N-ggxY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
