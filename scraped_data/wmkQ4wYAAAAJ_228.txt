We found that differences in observed ant species richness and composition between rehabilitation and reference sites at a northern Australian uranium mine increased markedly with increasing sampling intensity (through repeat sampling), reflecting differences in the numbers of uncommon species. Ensuring appropriately high sampling intensity is important in assessments of restoration success using insect bioindicators."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16976079073598217398", "cites_id": ["16976079073598217398"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.13172", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tpzDbPkll-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
