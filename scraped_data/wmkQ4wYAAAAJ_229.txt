Accordingly, different trophic groups are expected to vary in their N-limitation depending on the extent to which they feed primarily on carbohydrate (CHO) or protein. Among arboreal ants, N-limitation ranges from high (for trophobiont tenders), intermediate (leaf foragers) and low (predators). We report results from a manipulative field experiment in a Brazilian savanna that tests the differential attractiveness of nitrogen and CHO to arboreal ants, as well as experimentally examines changes in broader ant foraging patterns in response to protein and CHO supplementation. Every tree within 32 20\u2009\u00d7\u200920 m plots were supplemented with either protein, CHO; protein\u2009+\u2009CHO or a water control (n\u2009=\u20098 in each case) for a 7-day period in each of the wet and dry seasons.
