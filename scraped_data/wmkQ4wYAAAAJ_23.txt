For example, ant\u2013seed dispersal mutualisms can be disrupted in habitats dominated by invasive ants. We propose that this disruption is related to changes in mean ant body size, given that invasive ants are smaller than most native seed\u2010dispersing ants. We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed\u2010dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass. Using a case study, we demonstrate that both the mean body size of seed\u2010collecting ants and seed dispersal distances are decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13972390460704796661", "cites_id": ["13972390460704796661"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/03-0364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9a9dWRjn58EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 8, "2006": 13, "2007": 17, "2008": 10, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 6, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 10, "2017": 17, "2018": 11, "2019": 14, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
