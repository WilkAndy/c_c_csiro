These may act as important fire refugia for fire\u2010sensitive biota. The fire\u2010sensitive tree Callitris intratropica occurs in small patches throughout the fire\u2010prone northern Australian savannas, and is widely seen as an indicator of low\u2010severity fire regimes and of good ecosystem health. Here, we address the question: to what extent do Callitris patches act as refuges for other fire\u2010sensitive biota, and therefore play a broader conservation role? We contrast floral and faunal species composition between Callitris patches and surrounding eucalypt savanna, using three case studies. In the first case study, a floristic analysis of 47 Callitris patches across Western Australia's Kimberley region showed that woody species in these patches were overwhelmingly widespread, fire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=582662014616023958", "cites_id": ["582662014616023958"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12050", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ljNN5QMIFggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
