Humid rain forest occurs throughout the eastern seaboard, from northern Queensland to Tasmania, where rainfall is high throughout the year (Webb and Tracey 1981). Extensive tracts of tropical and temperate rainforest occur in northern Queensland and Tasmania respectively, but the remainder exists as intermittent patches within a predominantly sclerophyll landscape dominated by Eucalyptus. Throughout the seasonal (monsoonal) tropics of northwestern Australia, rainforest occurs as thousands of small patches within a savanna matrix, and is normally restricted to areas of permanent water or topographic positions offering shelter from fire (McKenzie 1991; Russell-Smith 1991). monsoonal"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=592222696352499575", "cites_id": ["592222696352499575"], "pub_url": "http://antbase.org/ants/publications/21004/21004.pdf#page=64", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d8cDlGf_NwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
