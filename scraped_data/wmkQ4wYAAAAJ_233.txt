The \u2018individualistic\u2019 versus \u2018superorganismic\u2019 community concepts might provide good grist for the philosophical mill, but have little practical relevance to contemporary community ecology. Ecologists define communities in terms of current species distributions and interactions, and seek to integrate the roles of both biotic and abiotic factors influencing species distributions. There is no assumption of tight co\u2010evolution among component species; Walter and Paterson confuse \u2018organization\u2019 with \u2018co\u2010adaptation\u2019. Nor, contrary to the authors\u2019 claims, is there an implicit assumption that all community patterns are caused by competition. For most ecologists, the \u2018competition debate\u2019 ended a decade ago \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4359768374340665366", "cites_id": ["4359768374340665366"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1995.tb00562.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FsCOxzwCgTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2}}
