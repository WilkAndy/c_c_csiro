One approach to representativeness is to select taxa whose patterns of richness and composition are most strongly correlated with those of total invertebrates (i.e. all taxa combined). However, if different groups show very different distribution patterns then \u2018total diversity\u2019 cannot be considered as representative of the diversity of invertebrate taxa, and so an alternative approach to achieving representativeness is to base selection on complementarity (i.e. representing the full range of distribution patterns shown by different taxa). We use data on 12 invertebrate families (comprising ants, beetles, flies and spiders) sampled using pitfall traps across 78 sites in a tropical savanna landscape of northern Australia to identify a subset \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13421568334992851249", "cites_id": ["13421568334992851249"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19308301", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MUHhR0r9QroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
