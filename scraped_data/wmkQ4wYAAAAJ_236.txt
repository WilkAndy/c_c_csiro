We investigated the role of EFN as a driver of the spatial structure of ground-nesting ant communities occurring in dry forest in north-eastern Brazil. We examined the effects on this relationship of two global drivers of biodiversity decline, chronic anthropogenic disturbance and climate change (through decreasing rainfall). We mapped EFN-producing plants and ant nests in 20 plots distributed along independent gradients of disturbance and rainfall. We categorized ant species into three types according to their dependence on EFN: heavy users, occasional users and non-users. We found a strong relationship between ant dependence on EFN and nest proximity to EFN-producing plants: heavy-users (mean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2073045118154006487", "cites_id": ["2073045118154006487"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/extrafloral-nectar-as-a-driver-of-ant-community-spatial-structure-along-disturbance-and-rainfall-gradients-in-brazilian-dry-forest/56BC0102E29F0D1A40A2F1E926920B67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:11_tLo3vxBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
