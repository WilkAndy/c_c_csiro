Two measures of abundance in traps were used, one based on total numbers of ants, the other on species frequency of occurrence. All species commonly recorded in quadrats were collected in traps, and their relative abundances were highly correlated on all occasions. Of the 20 most common species in quadrats, five occurred with a significantly different (in all cases lower) frequency in pitfall traps, but these species represented only 1.8\u20133.1% of total quadrat counts. Results from quadrats and pitfall traps were particularly similar (r > 0.8) when species\u2010were classified into functional groups. Frequency data from traps may sometimes overestimate the abundance of widespread, solitary foraging species (e.g. \u2018Chelaner\u2019 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4612350354454685160", "cites_id": ["4612350354454685160"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1991.tb01054.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6CXryDVcAkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 9, "1998": 8, "1999": 6, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 10, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 15, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
