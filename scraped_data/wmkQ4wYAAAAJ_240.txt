This has important implications for the use of bioindicators in land management. We evaluated the local\u2010scale responses of multiple faunal taxa to land\u2010use change in the Brazilian Cerrado measuring different aspects (taxonomic and functional) and levels (alpha and beta) of diversity. We compared ant, dung beetle and bird assemblages inhabiting remnants of natural habitat (savanna and semi\u2010deciduous forest) with those found in cattle pastures, soy fields or Eucalyptus plantations. Species richness was markedly higher in natural habitats for ants and birds but not for dung beetles. Effects on functional alpha diversity were taxon specific and there was not such a contrast between natural and anthropogenic habitats. Patterns of functional beta diversity were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8600128452012144438", "cites_id": ["8600128452012144438"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.14270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nvfp_ELLWXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 6}}
