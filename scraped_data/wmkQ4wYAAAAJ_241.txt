Here we use savanna ant communities as a striking example where such convergence has not occurred. The savanna ant faunas of Australia, Brazil and Africa have very different functional composition due to their highly contrasting evolutionary origins.We synthesise the literature relating to the diversity and composition of savanna ant communities in the three continents, along with ant community responses to fire and aridity.Australian savannas evolved in association with a desert biome and its fauna is strongly arid adapted: it is exceptionally thermophilic, granivorous species are extremely diverse and abundant, high diversity is maintained with increasing aridity, and communities are highly resilient to simplification of vegetation structure induced by frequent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14861277424424547921", "cites_id": ["14861277424424547921"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.14343", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UXZbPxTdPc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
