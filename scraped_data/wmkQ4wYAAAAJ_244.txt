Here, we report on the first ecological study of dung beetles in an Australian tropical savanna, documenting species composition, food preferences and responses to fire. Dung beetles were baited using dung from five types of vertebrates as well as mushrooms. We sampled at nine plots subject to experimental fire regimes (three replicates each of high fire severity, moderate fire severity and unburnt over 15 years) at the Territory Wildlife Park near Darwin. Our samples were comprised entirely of nine native species of Onthophagus. Dog dung was the most attractive bait, recording all nine species and nearly 80% of all individuals, whereas no beetles were recorded at either wallaby or magpie\u2010goose dung. Dung beetle abundance was highest under high fire severity and was negatively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1227156708962688346", "cites_id": ["1227156708962688346"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.12910", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wl11aYa8BxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
