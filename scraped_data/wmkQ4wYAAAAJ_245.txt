Because such \u2018parataxonomic\u2019 classifications are typically spatially limited in scope, we examined the influence of increasing spatial scale on the congruence of two such approaches with a more traditional taxonomic classification.Location\u2003 Sturt National Park, north\u2010western New South Wales, Australia.Methods\u2003 Specimens of two ant genera, Camponotus and Rhytidoponera, were classified by three independent methods. The \u2018parataxonomic\u2019 classification assigned specimens to morphospecies without specialist taxonomic expertise; the \u2018taxonomic\u2019 classification assigned specimens to either described species or, where this was not possible, to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using specialist taxonomic expertise; the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13590566064076299830", "cites_id": ["13590566064076299830"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00492.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nh6_UdRjm7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
