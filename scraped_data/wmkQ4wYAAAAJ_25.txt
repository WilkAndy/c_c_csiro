Its impacts have been documented extensively in relatively depauperate invertebrate communities, but not in species-rich habitats such as tropical rain forests. Here we describe the local distribution of P. megacephala and its impacts on native invertebrate assemblages in and around a rain forest patch at Howard Springs, in Australia's monsoonal tropics. P. megacephala was found to be confined to a single area of approximately 25\u2009ha, with its distribution centered on drainage lines and the rain forest. Significant but weak correlations were found between its abundance and vegetative canopy cover (positive) and distance from the rain forest (negative). In the most heavily infested area within the rain forest, the abundance of P. megacephala was 37\u2013110 times that of total native \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1651621648174291266", "cites_id": ["1651621648174291266"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00008824", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QhnGaiO96xYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 12, "2005": 9, "2006": 7, "2007": 15, "2008": 11, "2009": 20, "2010": 20, "2011": 9, "2012": 15, "2013": 15, "2014": 13, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
