This Special Issue comes in the wake of a series of extreme wildfires across the world, from the Amazon, to Siberia, California, Portugal, South Africa and eastern Australia (Duane et al., 2021). These \u201cmegafires,\u201d variously defined according to their size, intensity, or impacts (Attiwill & Binkley, 2013), are perhaps the signature feature of Earth's fiery transition to what Pyne (2020) has termed the \u201cPyrocene.\u201d Projections of increased fire weather and extended fire seasons portend an increasingly flammable planet (Ellis et al.; Jain et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021).Recent megafires have alarmed conservation scientists and practitioners because their scale and intensity demands new ways of thinking about biodiversity conservation in fire-prone landscapes, and, potentially, new tools tailored to avoid or minimise fire-induced declines and extinctions (Wintle et al \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2457041499041748740", "cites_id": ["2457041499041748740"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/48650460", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BNfGtDkqGSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
