Here we investigate the individual and interactive effects of increasing CAD and decreasing rainfall on the composition and taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of plants possessing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) in semi-arid Brazilian Caatinga. EFNs attract ants that protect plants against insect herbivore attack and are extremely prevalent in the Caatinga flora. EFN-bearing plants were censused along gradients of disturbance and rainfall in Catimbau National Park in north-eastern Brazil. We recorded a total of 2243 individuals belonging to 21 species. Taxonomic and functional composition varied along the rainfall gradient, but not along the disturbance gradient. There was a significant interaction between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17861314332487712241", "cites_id": ["17861314332487712241"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-021-05074-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8f2FicAi4PcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
