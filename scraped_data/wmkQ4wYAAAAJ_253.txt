We also sought to identify beetle species that might act as indicators of particular fire regimes, and examined the extent to which analysis at the family level is sufficient to reveal patterns evident from species\u2010level analysis.  3 \u2002Beetles were sampled using sweep nets during February (mid\u2010wet season) and May (end of wet season) each year, from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9900931161581220973", "cites_id": ["9900931161581220973"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2001.00575.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bfSkH28sZ4kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
