They represent up to half of total insect biomass globally, and their biomass exceeds that of all vertebrates combined in most terrestrial biomes. Ants are deeply connected within terrestrial ecosystems. They play key roles as soil engineers, predators and re-cyclers of nutrients. They have particularly important interactions with plants as defenders against herbivores, as seed dispersers and as seed predators; as such they have had a significant influence on plant evolution and diversification. The deep connections of ants with ecosystems means that ant-species composition can provide important insights into ecosystem health. Combined with their ubiquity and ease of sampling, this has seen ants widely used as bio-indicators in land management.One downside to the ecological dominance of ants is that they feature on the list of the world\u2019s worst invasive species. Species such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), African big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala) and Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) have been inadvertently transported throughout the world and have invaded both agricultural and native ecosystems, with devastating impacts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5488012828109719113", "cites_id": ["5488012828109719113"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1380224", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SUZEJpdWKUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
