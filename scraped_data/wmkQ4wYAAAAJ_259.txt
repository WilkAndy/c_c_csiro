Here we take it literally to mean monitoring the variety of life, and assume that its aim is to track changes in the biological integrity of ecosystems. The most commonly used operational units for measuring biodiversity are multicellular species (Purvis & Hector 2000), and the vast majority of these are invertebrates, especially insects and other arthropods (Wilson 1988). Given their overwhelming dominance, no biodiversity monitoring programme can be considered credible without the inclusion of invertebrates (Taylor & Doran 2001)The distribution of terrestrial invertebrates is far more finely patterned than is the case for either vertebrates or vascular plants (Oliver et al. 1997; Ferrier et al. 1999; French 1999; Pik et al. 2002), and vegetation has repeatedly been shown to be a poor surrogate for patterns of invertebrate biodiversity (Crisp et al. 1998; Jonsson & Jonsell 1999; Eyre & Luff 2002). In contrast to vertebrates (Koops & Catling 199?), it is therefore futile to seek attributes of habitat structure that meaningfully act as surrogates for invertebrate biodiversity (Abensperg-Traun et al. 1996; Newell 1997; York 1999). Invertebrates must be monitored directly. Here we address invertebrates in the context of monitoring biodiversity in Australia\u2019s rangelands. We focus on ants because they are the dominant terrestrial invertebrate group in the Australian environment, and are by far the most commonly used invertebrate indicators in land management. We begin by reviewing the use of invertebrates, particularly ants, as bio-indicators in Australia, then present a case study involving ant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7112510773416988414", "cites_id": ["7112510773416988414"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9125bc962b7fed5e3731aff0df38c9e30ca05a1f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_o6oXt22tGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
