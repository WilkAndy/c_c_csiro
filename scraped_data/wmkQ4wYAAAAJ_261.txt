However, there is scant evidence that this outcome is achieved. Here we investigate the effects of tree planting following cessation of cropping on ant communities. Ants are a dominant faunal group, functionally important for ecosystem recovery and widely used as indicators of ecosystem restoration. Using a space\u2010for\u2010time approach, we surveyed eight fallow croplands, 10\u2010year\u2010old planted old fields, and reference woodlands in semi\u2010arid south\u2010western Australia. We tested the extent ant communities in planted old fields diverged from those of fallow cropland and converged with those of reference woodlands, distinguishing areas under tree canopies and open patches to account for a direct tree effect. We analyzed ant community data at species, genus, and functional\u2010group levels.
