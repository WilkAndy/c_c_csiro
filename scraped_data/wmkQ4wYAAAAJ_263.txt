Here we focus on the last of these and carry out a review of the various approaches used, technical recommendations, and effectiveness of fuel management practices in different regions of the world (SE Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the USA). The overall objective is to contrast approaches of different countries, and provide evidence (or lack of it) for the application of scientific principles in developing technical specifications, as well as in evaluating their effectiveness. For this purpose we defined fuel managed areas as parcels of land, linear or patch-shaped, where the total or partial removal of fuels is applied and maintained through physical treatments, land management practices, or use of physical barriers. We have reviewed the technical specifications included in legislation and management guidelines provided by official institutions involved in fire, forest and land management in different countries, separating it into two categories: i) overall landscape approaches (linear fuel breaks and area-wide treatments); and ii) specific regulations for the Wildland-Urban interface. We first reviewed the approaches used and the fuel management objectives for each country, including: (a) the use of legislation or technical recommendations, and whether different rules apply to different stakeholders; (b) the spatial scales at which these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4063998116650722516", "cites_id": ["4063998116650722516"], "pub_url": "https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/79572", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1KTSTsE4ZjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
