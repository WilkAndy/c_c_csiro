Although such \u2018equilibrial\u2019factors are undoubtedly important, it seems clear that they are insufficient to account for the high levels of local species richness that are commonly observed. For example, semi-arid Australia routinely packs per hectare 100 or more species, most of which are dietary generalists nesting in the ground, and similarly high species densities routinely occur within leaf litter of lowland tropical rainforest. Such species density within a single family is unparalleled, and is all the more noteworthy because of the high levels of interspecific competition characteristic of ant communities. Very high species densities require two conditions to be met:(i) a large number of species must successfully establish; and (ii) there must be a high rate of local species survival once established. A strong relationship often exists between local and regional ant diversity, but otherwise little is known about the supply-side ecology of ant communities. It is easier to see why ant species can be so locally persistent once established, beyond effects of niche partitioning. First, ant sociality and modularity buffer against adversity due to confinement of the perennating apparatus (the queen) within a protective nest, and by enabling a response through reduced colony size rather than death. Second, although ants show very high competitive interactions at a point scale (eg at a particular food item), it is very difficult for point-scale behavioural dominance to scale-up to site-scale \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7920026729376952273", "cites_id": ["7920026729376952273"], "pub_url": "https://iussi.confex.com/iussi/2006/techprogram/P1253.HTM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0a8cKFmW6W0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
