None of the current monitoring programs explicitly encompasses biodiversity, although it has been suggested that some indicators of land condition may also be useful surrogates for biodiversity health. We tested this assumption through detailed biodiversity assessment at sites in a range of condition states in two pastoral regions in northern Australia, the Victoria River District (Northern Territory) and the Dalrymple Shire (Queensland). In each region, and amongst most major taxa (birds, mammals, reptiles, plants, ants), there was significant variation in biotic composition between sites in different condition classes. The relationship between species richness and condition varied between taxa, but in each major taxon we were able to identify species and functional groups that had increaser and decreaser responses to condition. To at least some extent, therefore, conventional land condition assessment in rangelands can also be informative about biodiversity health. However, we also note a number of potential limitations to this conclusion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=609665880583598209", "cites_id": ["609665880583598209"], "pub_url": "https://rangelandsgateway.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/arsbc-2004-183-188.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gXDcY-P3dQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
