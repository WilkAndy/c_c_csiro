The primary impact of fire on fauna is typically indirect through habitat change. In particular, in mesic forests different animal species are favoured at different times since fire as habitat complexity increases with vegetation recovery. However, this will not necessarily be the case in habitats with low complexity such as many of those occurring in arid and semi\u2010arid regions. Here, we investigate the relationship between fire history and ant diversity and composition in semi\u2010arid mallee of south\u2010eastern Australia. We surveyed ants at 11 sites in the Little Desert National Park and nearby private land that last burnt 0.5, 6 or 40\u2009years ago. We found no relationship between time since fire and either ant diversity or composition, and this can be explained by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aec.13308", "cites_per_year": {}}
