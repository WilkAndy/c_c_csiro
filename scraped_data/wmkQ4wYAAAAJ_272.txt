We tested this idea by evaluating if the degree of vertical stratification of savanna ant assemblages varies along a latitudinal climatic gradient, and by determining how compositional dissimilarities within each stratum varies across increased geographical and climatic distances.Brazil.Ants.We sampled ants foraging on the ground or in trees at 32 sites. Species were classified according to their main foraging stratum, as arboreal, ground\u2010dweller or strata generalist. We used linear models to evaluate the effects of latitude and sampling stratum on species richness, and the effect of latitude on the proportion of species typical from trees or from the ground in different sampling strata.
