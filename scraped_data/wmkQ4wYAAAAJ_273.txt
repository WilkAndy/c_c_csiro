The framework has broad application, and we present a specific case here to demonstrate the process. Our case study is the Tiwi Islands in northern Australia, where a large Acacia mangium plantation is a potential source of biofuel feedstock. Two types of technology were considered: 1. Bio-oil from pyrolysis in diesel generators and 2. Direct combustion coupled with a steam turbine. The biomass was characterized and found to have adequate properties for an energy crop, with a lower heating value of about 18 MJ/kg and entire tree ash content of 2%. Measurements from trees that were damaged from wildfires had similar results, showing potential value recovery for a plantation after unplanned fire. In comparison to a petroleum diesel-based generator, the bio-oil system was 12% more expensive. The direct combustion system was found to be the most economical of those explored here, costing as low as 61% of the bio-oil system. Additional social and environmental benefits were identified, including local employment opportunities, improved energy security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings of high techno-economic potential of bioenergy systems, especially through direct combustion, are widely applicable to on-demand renewable energy supply in remote communities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/en16020666", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qCwOUB-QdVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
