It is critical to include fauna in such assessments, not just because of their intrinsic biodiversity value but also because of the many ecological roles that animals play in restoration processes. However, a widely accepted framework for specifying faunal standards for restoration is lacking. Here we present such a framework, incorporating: (1) the identification of appropriate reference conditions; (2) the taxa to be targeted for assessment; (3) the attributes of these taxa to be measured; (4) acceptable similarity with reference conditions; and (5) robust sampling methodologies for reliable assessment. We illustrate this framework using the restoration program at Ranger Uranium Mine in the Australian seasonal tropics, which aims to establish an environment similar to the surrounding World \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.13735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WT-xyuTdNkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
