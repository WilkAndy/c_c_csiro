Understanding how these modified fire regimes impact vegetation structure and dynamics is essential for informed biodiversity conservation and carbon management in savanna ecosystems. We used a long-term fire experiment at the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP), northern Australia, to investigate the consequences of altered fire regimes for habitat structure and aboveground carbon storage. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3D) structure in high spatial resolution with airborne LiDAR, across 18 replicated 1\u2009ha plots of varying fire frequency and season treatments. We used LiDAR-derived canopy height and cover metrics to extrapolate field-based measures of woody biomass to the full extent of the experimental site (R2\u2009=\u20090.82, RMSE\u2009=\u20097.35\u2009t\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121), and analysed differences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1455940949337685244&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
