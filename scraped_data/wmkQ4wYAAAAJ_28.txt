Here we examine the relative effects of habitat fragmentation (fragment size and amount of forest cover retained in the surrounding landscape) and habitat structure (tree density and richness) on ant species and functional composition in the Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil. Our study was carried out in 19 fragments ranging in size from 10 to 3,500 ha. We recorded 146 ant species from 41 genera. Fragment size and tree density were the most important variables predicting species richness and functional diversity. Additionally, fragment area and tree density also explained the richness of a range of global functional groups (Cryptic Species, Specialists Predators and Tropical-climate Specialists) and Atlantic forest functional groups (Cryptic Predators, Cryptic Omnivores, Epigaeic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2953075828789140990", "cites_id": ["2953075828789140990"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-012-0271-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_t3E-dFu-ygJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 9, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 25, "2018": 15, "2019": 27, "2020": 15, "2021": 24, "2022": 22, "2023": 12}}
