Here, we investigate how habitat fragmentation affects extrafloral nectary (EFN)\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing plants and ant functional groups known to attend EFNs in a fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest. Extrafloral nectary\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing trees were identified in 50 0.1\u00e2\u00c4\u00eaha plots located in forest fragments, edge and interior patches. Ants were surveyed in 30 1\u00e2\u00c4\u00eam\u00c2\u00b2 litter samples in each of 17 forest fragments and in forest interior. Extrafloral nectary\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing plants accounted for 19.9% of individuals and 10.5% of species and included both pioneer and shade\u00e2\u00c4\u00eatolerant species similarly rich in the three habitat types. However, shade\u00e2\u00c4\u00eatolerant individuals accounted for >80% of EFN\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing plants in forest interior, compared with 2% in forest edge and 29% in fragments. Forest edge and fragment plots had a third fewer EFN\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing individuals and species compared with forest interior. This appeared to have important implications for local ant communities as the density of EFN\u00e2\u00c4\u00eabearing trees was the most important variable explaining the species richness of arboreal dominant ants. Our results show that plant loser\u00e2\u00c4\u00ecwinner replacements promoted by forest fragmentation can cascade through higher trophic levels, with implications for forest dynamics and biodiversity conservation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201800143158", "cites_per_year": {}}
