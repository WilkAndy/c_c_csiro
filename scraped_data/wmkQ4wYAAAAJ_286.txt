This project addresses the question: How sensitive is the biota of these woodlands to variation in fire regimes?It uses results from a controlled fire experiment to model the population dynamics of the dominant eucalypt trees, and examines associations between historical fire regimes and patterns of faunal diversity. Eucalypt populations appear to be limited primarily by water availability, with fire not being a major driver. Changes in tree populations are principally driven by the dynamics of the fire-sensitive native cypress pine (Callitris columellaris), which invades the grassy woodlands in the absence of fire."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GISERA-fire-and-biodiversity-final-report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D3xKFEqyR38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
