Using a unique global database of 1128 local ant assemblages, we examined whether climate mediates the effects of habitat disturbance on assemblage structure at a global scale. Species richness and evenness were associated positively with temperature, and negatively with disturbance. However, the interaction among temperature, precipitation and disturbance shaped species richness and evenness. The effect was manifested through a failure of species richness to increase substantially with temperature in transformed habitats at low precipitation. At low precipitation levels, evenness increased with temperature in undisturbed sites, peaked at medium temperatures in disturbed sites and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/id/eprint/2089", "cites_per_year": {}}
