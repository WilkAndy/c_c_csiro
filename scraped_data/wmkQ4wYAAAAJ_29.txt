We have used this evidence base to develop global and regional statistical models of how local biodiversity responds to these measures. We describe and make freely available this 2016 release of the database, containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species. We outline how the database can help in answering a range of questions in ecology and conservation biology. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most geographically and taxonomically representative database of spatial comparisons of biodiversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17378116432998387250", "cites_id": ["17378116432998387250"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mk4_ltJ4K_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 17, "2018": 30, "2019": 25, "2020": 35, "2021": 34, "2022": 32, "2023": 13}}
