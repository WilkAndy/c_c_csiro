These gaps were attributed to local mortality of the seed bank due to lethal subsurface soil temperatures caused by long fire residence times. A return visit to the site in May 2010 revealed the sorghum gaps to be remarkably persistent, with no evidence of sorghum recolonisation after two wet seasons."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.520755262338194", "cites_per_year": {}}
