Previously recorded only from the Top End of the Northern Territory, the species is now known to be widely distributed in subtropical and tropical Queensland, with records from suburban Brisbane and the Blackall Range in SB Queensland, the Proserpine region in central Queensland, Cairns in northern Queensland and Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef. The Queensland records arc predominantly from relatively disturbed environments, including suburban and agricultural landscapes, suggesting that 'P. membranifera' is introduced. Its wide distribution suggests that it has been present in Australia for a considerable length of time, but its cryptic nature and propensity to occur in disturbed habitats probably contributed to the delay in its detection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.068331236019550", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MPbFDhxxKpEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
