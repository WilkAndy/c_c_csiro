Ants have been shown to be ideal indicators of ecosystem change due to their high abundances and diversity, their ecological importance at all trophic levels, the relative ease with which they can be sampled and sorted, and their sensitivity to ecological change. This paper provides an overview of three case studies of responses of ant assemblages to anthropogenic disturbance gradients in southern Africa. The case studies involved rehabilitation of ash dams associated with power stations, different stages of recovery from veld fires, and grazing by a feral horse population in a nature reserve. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps along the disturbance gradients. There was a clear successional trend of ant community development along the ash dam rehabilitation gradient, but this was not towards natural grassland, reflecting the markedly different substrate and plant composition on ash dams. Ant community responses to veld fire reflected the longer-term impact of fire on habitat structure. There was little systematic variation in ant communities along the grazing gradient, indicating that grazing by feral horses had minimal ecological impact. The three case studies emphasize the applicability of ants as indicators of ecosystem change, and we recommend their increased use in environmental assessment and monitoring programs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3299374001039376585&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yYAcUSy7yS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
