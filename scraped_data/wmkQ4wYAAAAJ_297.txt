Soil biodiversity is nonetheless relatively poorly understood in comparison to above-ground biota. In Australia, sampling records are patchy and we possess a limited ecological understanding for most species. Despite this, soil biodiversity is critical in regulating major ecosystem processes (eg decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling) and Australia is home to many iconic as well as Gondwanan relictual species. While a reduction in the abundance and diversity of soil biodiversity will compromise overall ecosystem function, we lack understanding of how much redundancy is present in our soil communities and thus how resilient our systems are to change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Theodore-Evans-4/publication/242702742_Soil_biodiversity_and_ecology_emphasising_earthworms_termites_and_ants_as_key_macro-invertebrates/links/0c960534684b40f6e3000000/Soil-biodiversity-and-ecology-emphasising-earthworms-termites-and-ants-as-key-macro-invertebrates.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4MY5-_zNUa0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
