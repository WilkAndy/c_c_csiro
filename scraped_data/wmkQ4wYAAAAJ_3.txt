The functional groups are then used as a basis for determining patterns of community structure along the environmental gradient, and for comparing community structure between Australia and North America. Quantitative information on species com\u2010 position was obtained from pitfall traps, and patterns of ant abundance at tuna baits were used to determine relative behavioural dominance among taxa. A total of eighty\u2010three species from twenty\u2010eight genera was recorded along the elevational gradient, with site species richness ranging from four (high elevation Douglas fir forest) to thirty\u2010three (mid elevation oak\u2013juniper woodland).
