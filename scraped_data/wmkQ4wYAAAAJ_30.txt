We provide the background and methodology for a landscape\u2010scale savanna fire experiment at Kapalga, located in Kakadu National Park in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. The experiment addresses the limitations of previous savanna fire experiments, including inappropriately small sizes of experimental units, lack of replication, consideration of a narrow range of ecological responses and an absence of detailed measurement of fire behaviour. In contrast to those elsewhere in the world, Australia's savannas are sparsely populated and largely uncleared, with fires lit primarily in a conservation, rather than pastoral, context. Fire management has played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of Aboriginal people, who have occupied the land for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8860627453428979066", "cites_id": ["8860627453428979066"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00708.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:elW1KLlF93oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 11, "2001": 10, "2002": 12, "2003": 17, "2004": 12, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 12, "2008": 6, "2009": 10, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
