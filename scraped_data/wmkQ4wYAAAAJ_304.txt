The report identifies and enumerates the ants collected, describes differences in ant species richness and community structure between sites and sampling times, and makes recommendations regarding future ant monitoring at the mine.Ant sampling was conducted by Ansar Environmental Pty Ltd at ten sites, comprising eight reference sites representing a range of local habitats, and two minesites undergoing rehabilitation. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps during April 1999, September 1999, and January 2000, and sent to CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology for identification and analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/files/22706558/Thesis_CDU_6331_Hoffmann_B.pdf#page=271", "cites_per_year": {}}
