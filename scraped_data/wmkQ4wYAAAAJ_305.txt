Ants had been sampled using pitfall traps by a CapCoal consultant at three reference sites and six rehabilitated minesites during February, with the samples sent to us for identification and analysis. The three reference sites (sites 1, 3 and 7) and two of the rehabilitated sites (site 8 and 9) had been previously sampled on three occasions during a pilot study in 1997 (Andersen and Hoffmann 1998).A total of 92 ant species from 22 genera were collected during 1998, including 21 species not recorded in the pilot study. The 1998 samples support the conclusion of the pilot study that the German Creek area supports an extremely rich ant fauna, with up to 88 species so far recorded from a single reference site."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/56f4f8e8915fc903991dc573714b0416/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366#page=198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oVkcghQw3UYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
