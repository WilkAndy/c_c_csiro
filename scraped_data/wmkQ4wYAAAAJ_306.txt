The report identifies the ants collected, describes differences in ant species richness and community structure between sites and sampling times, and makes recommendations regarding future ant monitoring at the mine.Nine sites had been selected for study by mine staff, comprising seven reference sites representing a range of local habitats, and two mine sites undergoing rehabilitation. Ants had been sampled by mine staff using pitfall traps operated during January (mid wet season), April (end of wet season) and September (late dry season) 1997, and sent to the consultants for identification and analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/files/22706558/Thesis_CDU_6331_Hoffmann_B.pdf#page=187", "cites_per_year": {}}
