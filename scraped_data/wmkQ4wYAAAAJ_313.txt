Most of the Torresian taxa are widely distributed in northern Australia, but several (eg, species of Oecophylla, Oligomyrmex, Quadristruma and certain Leptogenys, Crematogaster and Polyrhachis) are characteristic of rainforests, providing bio-geographical links with the eastern coast. A large proportion of these are cryptic species, and their occurrence in rainforest patches was apparently associated with the availability of moist litter during the dry season. The most common ants were unspecialized species of Pheidole, Tetramorium and Monomorium. This, combined with a high species turnover across patches, indicates that the ant communities are loosely structured in comparison with those of surrounding sclerophyll habitats. This survey provides baseline data for monitoring any future change in the Kimberley rainforest habitats."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14322583556743411318&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:draKTdwJxMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
