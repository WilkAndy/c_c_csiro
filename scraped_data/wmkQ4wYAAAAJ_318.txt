Sampling was conducted during the dry season (June) of 1988, with supplementary litter samples collected during the following wet season. A total of 102 species (19\u201341 per patch, mean 33) from 33 genera were recorded, wrth the richest genera being Pheidole (13 species), Monomorum (12) and Polyrhachis (10), Arid-adapted genera such as fridomyrmex and Melophorus were virtually absent Forty-six species were considered to belong to Torresian taxa, three to Eyrean taxa, five to Bassan taxa, and 48 to widespread taxa Surrounding open sclerophyll habitats support a far greater proportion of Eyrean taxa, and lesser proportion of Torresian'axa Most of the Torresian taxa are widely distributed in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Majer/publication/279573496_The_structure_and_biogeography_of_rainforest_ant_communities_in_the_Kimberley_region_of_northwestern_Australia/links/56f883d208ae81582bf39c79/The-structure-and-biogeography-of-rainforest-ant-communities-in-the-Kimberley-region-of-northwestern-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XIbEltROgdwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
