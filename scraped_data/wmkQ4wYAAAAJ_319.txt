In this review we collateand interpret research on genetic caste determination in ants and discuss this research within the historical frameworkof caste determination in the social insects. While early researchers disagreed over the relative importance of rearingenvironment and genes on caste determination, the notion that caste is determined by environment had been largelysupported by both theory and empirical results\u2013until relatively recently. The growing utility of molecular markers, together with breeding studies and other quantitative genetic approaches, has now demonstrated a genetic component tocaste across numerous social insect taxa. The strength of the genetic component varies and may often \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18181794779598692552&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
