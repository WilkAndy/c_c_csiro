We studied the response of vascular plants, ants, beetles, vertebrates and macrofungi to different fire interval sequences resulting from planned and unplanned fires in ecosystems of southwestern Australia. Using data spanning 1972\u20132004, we investigated community-level responses to consecutive short (SS:\u2264 5 years), consecutive long (LL:\u2265 10 years), one very long (VL: 30 years), or mixed/moderate (M: 6\u20139 years) fire interval (s) in forest and shrubland ecosystems. All sites were sampled at a common time-since-fire of~ 4 years. The influence of fire interval sequences on taxonomic groups was minimal and difficult to detect, suggesting a biota that is highly resilient to fire. There was weak evidence of compositional differences between SS and LL/VL regimes for plants, ants, beetles and macrofungi but no difference between either of these regimes and the M-regime. Occasional short (3\u20135 years) intervals between fires are unlikely to have a persistent effect on community composition, though a sustained regime of short or long intervals may alter species composition and/or abundance. We suggest that variability in fire intervals is important for long-term conservation of the biota."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/66674145/Resilience_of_open_forests_and_shrubland20210425-14418-1cspvhb.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A0uT825bbMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
