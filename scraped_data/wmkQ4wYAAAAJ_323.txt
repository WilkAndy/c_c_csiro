This issue has important implications for an understanding of the biogeography of, and speciation processes within, this arid continent. We aim to show that the revision does not adequately document true morphological variation within the genus, and that many of the recognised taxa are multiple and often distantly related species, with clear morphological differentiation between populations that are often sympatric. We illustrate this by documenting morphological and genetic diversity within a taxon described by HETERICK & SHATTUCK (2011) as a morphologically uniform species, I. coeruleus. We show that this\" species\" represents several clearly differentiated morphotaxa with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14049140115858267874&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4h5s9X-S-MIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
