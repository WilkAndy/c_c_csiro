Inappropriate fire regimes have been identified as a factor threatening small mammals across northern Australia, and a possible mechanism might be through the effects of fire on food availability. Wet season sweep-net samples were taken in two tropical savanna habitats, with contrasting laterite and sandstone substrates, from 2008 to 2010. Sites were stratified by time-since-fire to analyse post-fire invertebrate changes. In addition, experimental burns were implemented in 2010 to investigate immediate invertebrate responses. Total invertebrate abundance in sweep samples declined by 80% immediately following fire, reflecting the loss of grass-layer habitat. There were also compositional changes, with relative declines in Hemiptera and Lepidoptera and an increase in Orthoptera."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP105867&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yKpRXBwaKI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
