In the monsoonal tropics of northern Australia, the small and isolated rainforest patches that are embedded in the predominantly savanna landscape support a highly distinctive and biogeographically significant fauna. The savanna-rainforest contrast is particularly acute for ants, with the savanna fauna dominated by endemic Australian taxa centred on the arid zone to the south, whereas rainforest features shade-tolerant taxa of Indo-Malayan origin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP117841&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yeB36pW_AScJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
