The ants were extremely abundant and rich in species (86 species from 27 genera were recorded from two 50 m \u00d7 25 m plots within 25 m of each other) and were dominated by species ofMonomorium and Iridomyrmex. Pronounced site differences in species composition were found, with 73% of the most abundant species showing a strong site preference. The ants exhibited marked seasonality: activity was highest in summer and lowest in winter and this was accompanied by a high turnover of species in time, resulting in pronounced seasonal differences in species composition. Most foraging was nocturnal during summer but was almost exclusively diurnal during winter, and individual species displayed distinctive patterns of diet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10278697675942864844", "cites_id": ["10278697675942864844"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1983.tb01600.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zCc10BNFpY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 5, "1991": 8, "1992": 7, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 10, "1998": 4, "1999": 8, "2000": 3, "2001": 7, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
