The report synthesises understanding of the drivers of fire regimes in Australia, identifies changes to fire regimes projected from climate change and identifies the broad implications of these changes for biodiversity. 'Fire regime' is defined as the history of fire events at a point in the landscape.  The report finds that fire weather will become more severe in many regions, particularly southern Australia, and that the interactions between biodiversity and fire regimes are complex. It develops a national framework to assess the likely impacts of climate change on fire regimes and biodiversity for different bioregions, using a case study approach.  Climate change may affect fire regimes across the Australian landscape through changes to temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind, and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. \u2022 Modeled climate projections show that much of southern Australia may become warmer and drier. This modeling suggests that, by 2020, extreme fire danger days in south-eastern Australia may occur 5 to 65 per cent more often than at present. \u2022 For example, modeling of climate change impacts on the fire regimes of Australian Capital Territory (ACT) landscapes predicts that a 2oC increase in mean annual temperature would increase fire intensity by 25%, increase the area \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13095789657753778503", "cites_id": ["13095789657753778503"], "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/14926/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R_mlK0-XvbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 24, "2013": 13, "2014": 13, "2015": 18, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 16, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
