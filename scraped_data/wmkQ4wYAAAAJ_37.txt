The responses of insects and other arthropods to fire are especially poorly known, despite their dominant roles in the functioning of savannah ecosystems. Fire often appears to have little long\u2010term effect on ordinal\u2010level abundance of arthropods in temperate woodlands and open forests of southern Australia, and this paper addresses the extent to which such ordinal\u2010level resilience also occurs in Australia\u2019s tropical savannahs. The data are from a multidisciplinary, landscape\u2010scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park. Arthropods were sampled in the two major savannah habitats (woodland and open forest) using pitfall traps and sweep nets, in 15\u201320 km2 compartments subjected to one of three fire regimes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7804759139906775098", "cites_id": ["7804759139906775098"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2000.01038.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OmigGxYTUGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 8, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 11, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
