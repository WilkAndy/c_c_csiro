Broadly adapted species of Monomorium and Rhytidoponera, uncommonly recorded before the fire, became the most abundant ants caught. Seed removal from baits dropped by almost half during the week after fire, despite an increased catch of seed\u2010eating Rhytidoponera tasmaniensis. This coincided with a massive fire\u2010induced release of seeds stored inside woody fruits, suggesting that predator satiation occurred.The fall of Casuarina seeds and Eucalyptus chaff returned to pre\u2010fire (low) levels 1 week after the fire, but a substantial proportion of Eucalyptus seeds fell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6867937403589580449", "cites_id": ["6867937403589580449"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1988.tb00976.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oVaTQK7QT18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 6, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 4, "2000": 8, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 1, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
