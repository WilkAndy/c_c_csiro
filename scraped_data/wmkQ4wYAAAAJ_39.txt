Total numbers of individuals and species in the woodland were twice that in the heath; this was probably caused by the greater structural complexity of vegetation there, which increased the availability of nesting and foraging sites, the level of insolation of the ground, and possibly also food supply. Total ant activity followed seasonal cycles which correlated with changes in temperature and probably also food supply, and, within these constraints, was regulated by prevailing weather conditions. Individual species displayed distinctive foraging schedules which possibly play an important role in species coexistence.
