However, the use of terrestrial invertebrates as bioindicators remains more a topic of scientific discourse than a part of land\u2010management practice, largely because their inordinate numbers, taxonomic challenges and general unfamiliarity make invertebrates too intimidating for most land\u2010management agencies. Terrestrial invertebrates will not be widely adopted as bioindicators in land management until simple and efficient protocols have been developed that meet the needs of land managers.  2 In Australia, ants are one group of terrestrial insects that has been commonly adopted as bioindicators in land management, and this study examined the reliability of a simplified ant assessment protocol designed to be within the capacity of a wide range of land \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 507, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4095837983389365084", "cites_id": ["4095837983389365084"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00704.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XLN5-fFW1zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 13, "2004": 21, "2005": 16, "2006": 22, "2007": 25, "2008": 13, "2009": 28, "2010": 31, "2011": 18, "2012": 18, "2013": 39, "2014": 30, "2015": 25, "2016": 18, "2017": 27, "2018": 27, "2019": 37, "2020": 33, "2021": 28, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
