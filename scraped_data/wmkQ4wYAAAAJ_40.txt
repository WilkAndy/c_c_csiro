In Australia, however, the dynamics of grasshopper assemblages are extremely poorly understood. Here we describe the responses of grasshopper (Acridoidea, Eumastacoidea and Tettigonioidea) assemblages in the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory, Australia to disturbance associated with mining. Three questions were addressed in this study: (i) do local grasshopper assemblages show consistent responses to disturbance?; (ii) can particular species or functional groups be identified that are reliable indicators of ecological disturbance?; and (iii) to what extent do the responses of grasshopper assemblages merely reflect those of vegetation?
