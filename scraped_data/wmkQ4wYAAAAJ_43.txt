However, in northern Australia there are concerns that recent increases in the frequency and extent of high\u2010intensity fires are causing substantial declines in regional biodiversity values. In this paper we use two well\u2010studied and contrasting faunal groups, ants and small mammals, as case studies for reviewing faunal responses to fire in Australian savannas. The Australian savanna ant fauna is dominated by arid\u2010adapted taxa that are highly resilient to frequent fire and are not considered to be threatened by prevailing fire regimes. Indeed, frequent fire promotes ant diversity because it maintains an open habit that makes the dominant arid\u2010adapted taxa feel at home. Long\u2010term fire exclusion reduces ant diversity due to a marked decline in arid\u2010adapted taxa, and favours highly generalized, more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=884121255043017483", "cites_id": ["884121255043017483"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02334.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Cys24ZgHRQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 17, "2016": 19, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 12, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
