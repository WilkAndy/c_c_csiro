Although niche separation is undoubtedly important, it seems insufficient to account for the high levels of local species richness that are commonly observed. This paper explores alternative explanations for ant species coexistence, focusing on factors that prevent competitive exclusion in diverse ant communities experiencing high levels of behavioural dominance, such as characteristically occurs in Australia. Very high species densities require two conditions to be met: first, a large number of species must successfully establish; and second, there must be a high rate of species persistence once established. In this context I advance five propositions based around three sets of arguments. First, ant sociality and modularity confers a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12330033807785522931", "cites_id": ["12330033807785522931"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01810.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8_acvWsUHasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 11, "2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 10, "2014": 15, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
