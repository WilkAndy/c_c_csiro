Rates of seed removal by ants usually are measured by recording removal from artificial seed baits, but the reliability of this approach has not been tested, nor have there been many attempts to integrate the results with the activity of seed\u2010eating ants. This paper describes the rates of seed removal, estimated using a baiting technique that is tested for its reliability, by the seed\u2010eating ants in adjacent heath and woodland sites at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria. Ants removed up to 100% of seeds, but rates varied according to seed species, size of seed clumps, season, time of exposure, and other aspects of the baiting technique. Methodological guidelines are provided to make baiting conditions approximately those likely \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=302528159272203251", "cites_id": ["302528159272203251"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1985.tb00900.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8_P4C8LLMgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 6, "1989": 4, "1990": 7, "1991": 5, "1992": 5, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 6, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 7, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
