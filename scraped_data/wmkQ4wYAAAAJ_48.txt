The sensitivity of ants to intense pulses of unsustainable grazing was tested, in order to identify species, functional groups or community variables that could be used as indicators of more typical grazing pressure. Genera represented by the largest number of species were Iridomyrmex, Melophorus, Camponotus andMonomorium . A significant decrease in captures of Rhytidoponera metallica was recorded on swales, whereas theIridomyrmex sp.(bicknelli) group increased on dunes relative to controls following grazing. The Generalized Myrmicinae functional group increased on swales, and Hot-climate Specialist ants increased on dunes, after grazing. Several other species and functional groups responded qualitatively but not significantly. However, neither \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10048278410350457894", "cites_id": ["10048278410350457894"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196300906347", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JnQq5fmncosJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 8, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
