However, that scientific interest has not translated into widespread appreciation of, and concern about threats to, their biodiversity. In terms of biodiversity, grassy biomes are considered poor cousins of the other dominant biome of the tropics\u2014forests. Simple notions of grassy biomes being species-poor cannot be supported; for some key taxa, such as vascular plants, this may be valid, but for others it is not. Here, we use an analysis of existing data to demonstrate that high-rainfall tropical grassy biomes (TGBs) have vertebrate species richness comparable with that of forests, despite having lower plant diversity. The Neotropics stand out in terms of both overall vertebrate species richness \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4927004993825101989", "cites_id": ["4927004993825101989"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2015.0319", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pViF_-88YEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 17, "2020": 21, "2021": 27, "2022": 35, "2023": 8}}
