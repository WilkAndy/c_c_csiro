Yet, globally applied biome definitions ignore vegetation characteristics that are critical to their functioning and evolutionary history. Hence, TGB identification is inconsistent and misinterprets the ecological processes governing vegetation structure, with cascading negative consequences for biodiversity. Here, we discuss threats linked to the definition of TGB, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation schemes (REDD+), and enhanced atmospheric CO2, which may facilitate future state shifts. TGB degradation is insidious and less visible than in forested biomes. With human reliance on TGBs and their propensity for woody change, ecology and evolutionary history are fundamental to not only the identification of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 499, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12876446893923084184", "cites_id": ["12876446893923084184"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953471400041X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mKd3STpUsrIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 28, "2016": 65, "2017": 43, "2018": 57, "2019": 56, "2020": 58, "2021": 78, "2022": 74, "2023": 31}}
