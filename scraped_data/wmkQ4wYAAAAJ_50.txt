Using this technique I estimated that losses in Eucalyptus baxteri, Leptospermum myrsinoides, L. juniperinum and Casuarina pusilla were 2%, 10%, 28% and less than 1%, respectively. However insect exclusion experiments, which themselves gave conservative results, indicated that actual losses were 66%, 64%, 44% and 83%, respectively. The experiments suggested that insects had two important effects on seed production that could not be determined by assessing mature fruits and seeds: they reduced total numbers of seeds per fruit, and they caused large reductions in seed viability. The reliability of conventional methods of assessing pre-dispersal seed losses to insects must therefore be seriously questioned."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4522883217702023383", "cites_id": ["4522883217702023383"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/3565207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:13C0v1KCxD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 8, "1991": 2, "1992": 6, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
