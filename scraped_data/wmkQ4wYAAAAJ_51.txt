This is done by describing ant community responses to 23 years of fire exclusion in a northern Australian tropical savanna, with a particular focus on the extent of colonization by specialist rain forest taxa.Location\u2002 Solar Village, near Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory.Methods\u2002 Ants were sampled within 12 plots located inside (\u2018unburnt\u2019\u2013 protected from fire for 23\u2003years) and outside (burnt every 1\u20132\u2003years) Solar Village in ridge and slope habitat dominated by Eucalyptus spp. The litter, ground\u2010foraging and arboreal faunas were sampled separately, using Berlese funnels, unbaited pitfall traps and baited pitfall traps attached to tree trunks, respectively. Each species was assigned a forest\u2010association score ranging from 0 (open \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18270656637386319599", "cites_id": ["18270656637386319599"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01463.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:72aL3Ghpjv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 8, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
