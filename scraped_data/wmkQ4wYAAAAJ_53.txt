In Australia. where the native mammalian herbivore fauna is depauperate, attention has strongly focused on cattle production. In this review we consider three major classes of herbivorous insects, namely grazers, folivores and seed predators, and synthesize information on (1) their composition, diversity and abundance, (2) their ecological effects as herbivores, (3) their importance relative to that of herbivorous mammals, and (4) insect herbivory in Australia compared with that in savannas elsewhere in the world. The most important grazing insects are grasshoppers and harvester termites, although the latter are probably mostly detritivorous. Consumption rates by grasshoppers in African savannas can be comparable to those by large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10041184953862128809", "cites_id": ["10041184953862128809"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2845374", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qQTz2oN0WYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 4, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
