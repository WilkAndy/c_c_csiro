Our study describes ant species richness, species composition and functional group composition at eight sites undergoing rehabilitation (2\u201310 years old) at Callide Mine near Biloela, Queensland (680 mm mean annual rainfall) and compares them with those at three nearby, unmined reference sites. We address the extent to which ant communities at rehabilitation sites have converged with those at reference sites and, while we found convergence occurred at only one of the eight sites, we consider this highly noteworthy as it is the only case we are aware of where a rehabilitation minesite has achieved such convergence. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps (15 per site) during January 2001, the period of maximum ant activity. A total of 146 ant species from 34 genera were recorded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11051211877306545814", "cites_id": ["11051211877306545814"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-8903.4.s.2.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ljZvjKbKXZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
