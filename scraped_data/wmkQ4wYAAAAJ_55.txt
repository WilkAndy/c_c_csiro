Here we examine the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on distance dispersal by ants for the diaspores of myrmecochorous Euphorbiaceae in Brazilian Caatinga. Rates of diaspore removal and distances removed of Croton sonderianus and Jatropha mollissima were observed at 24 sites ranging from low to very high disturbance (primarily grazing by livestock, hunting and firewood collection). Despite a large number of seed-disperser ant species, there were only two species providing high-quality distance-dispersal services, Dinoponera quadriceps (40 % of all observed seed removals) and Ectatomma muticum (33 %). D. quadriceps was responsible for 97 % of all removals >2 m, and 100 % of all removals >5 m. Removal rates did not vary with disturbance for C. sonderianus (small \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11812226771723908624", "cites_id": ["11812226771723908624"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-013-2740-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EHb2Pqp17aMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 20, "2018": 16, "2019": 8, "2020": 19, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 12}}
