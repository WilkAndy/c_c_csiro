Ecological science can inform this effort, but when issues are socially and economically complex the inclination is to wait for science to provide answers before acting. Increasingly, managers and policy\u2010makers will be called on to use the present state of scientific knowledge to supply reasonable inferences for action based on imperfect knowledge. Hence, one challenge is to use existing ecological knowledge more effectively; a second is to tackle the critical unanswered ecological questions. This paper identifies areas of environmental management that are profoundly hindered by an inability of science to answer basic questions, in contrast to those areas where knowledge is not the major barrier to policy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11415101547264887711", "cites_id": ["11415101547264887711"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01938.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n0u8n2CWap4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 11, "2010": 10, "2011": 13, "2012": 16, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
