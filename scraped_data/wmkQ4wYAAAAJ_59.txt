Here we investigate its interaction with another key process in vegetation dynamics\u2014fire. We examine ant dispersal of seeds immediately before and after experimental burning in an Australian tropical savanna, one of the world\u2019s most fire-prone ecosystems. Specifically, our study addressed the effects of burning on: (1) the composition of ants removing seeds, (2) number of seed removals, and (3) distance of seed dispersal. Fire led to higher rates of seed removal post-fire when compared with unburnt habitat, and markedly altered dispersal distance, with mean dispersal distance increasing more than twofold (from 1.6 to 3.8 m), and many distance dispersal events greater than the pre-fire maximum (7.55 m) being recorded. These changes were due \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16795136693584353033", "cites_id": ["16795136693584353033"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-006-0570-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CVc5n9ZPFOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
