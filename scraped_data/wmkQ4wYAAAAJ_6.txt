Although PMB is an intuitively appealing concept, it has received little critical analysis. Thus we examined ecosystems where PMB has received the most attention and has been the most extensively implemented: tropical and subtropical savannas of Australia and Africa. We identified serious shortcomings of PMB: the ecological significance of different burning patterns remains unknown and details of desired fire mosaics remain unspecified. This has led to fire\u2010management plans based on pyrodiversity rhetoric that lacks substance in terms of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 480, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5165174450226556634", "cites_id": ["5165174450226556634"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00492.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2m6t1MtirkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 13, "2008": 14, "2009": 15, "2010": 21, "2011": 28, "2012": 39, "2013": 28, "2014": 31, "2015": 33, "2016": 31, "2017": 30, "2018": 38, "2019": 34, "2020": 35, "2021": 38, "2022": 36, "2023": 11}}
