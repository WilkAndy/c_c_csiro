Their activities influence soil structure, accelerate nutrient-cycling and affect plant growth and reproduction. They interact with other arthropods and are prey to a variety of reptiles, birds and mammals. However, despite their importance, little is known about the biology of Australia's exceptionally rich ant fauna, and hundreds of species remain unnamed. Few people are able to identify even the most common genera due to the shortage of popular guides."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11128630131262357909", "cites_id": ["11128630131262357909"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=p4mTEU6oUEAC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:lQGaciTWcJoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=dZHLGp0vvB&sig=h9kZJcBpcOUwnNibNB-yR4dog-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lQGaciTWcJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 4, "1997": 9, "1998": 3, "1999": 8, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
