Myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) is a particularly important plant\u2010animal mutualism in Australia, but little is known about its response to either disturbance or restoration following disturbance. Here we investigate the effects of disturbance on seed dispersal by ants, and the extent to which the ant\u2010seed relationship has re\u2010established at sites undergoing rehabilitation, at Ranger uranium mine in the seasonal tropics of Australia's Northern Territory. We focused on the composition of seed\u2010dispersing ant assemblages, rates of seed removal by ants, and the dispersal curves generated by ants, as determined by observations of removal from seed depots. Ten sites were studied, comprising four \u2018natural\u2019 (undisturbed) sites representing a range of savanna habitats \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11271269459600532049", "cites_id": ["11271269459600532049"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00756.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UeIyE9uXa5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
