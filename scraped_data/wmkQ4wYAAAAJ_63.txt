Up to 50% or more of the savanna landscapes of northern Australia are burnt each year, but the effects of these fires on savanna faunas are poorly known, especially for arthropods. 2. We investigated the responses of grass-layer beetles to three fire regimes (unburnt - fires excluded; early - annual fires lit early during the dry season; late - annual fires lit late during the dry season) as part of a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Australia's Northern Territory, where replicated fire regimes were applied to 15-20-km2 landscape units over a 5-year period. We also sought to identify beetle species that might act as indicators of particular fire regimes, and examined the extent to which analysis at the family level is sufficient to reveal patterns evident from species-level analysis. 3. Beetles were sampled using sweep nets during February (mid-wet season) and May (end of wet season) each year, from 1989 (18 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7544294005436629632", "cites_id": ["7544294005436629632"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2655732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gMIoM223smgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
