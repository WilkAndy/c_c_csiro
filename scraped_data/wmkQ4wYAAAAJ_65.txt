Community organization showed continuous change from drier sites (especially woodlands) where broadly\u2010adapted species of Rhytidoponera were particularly abundant, but many other taxa were also well\u2010represented, to wet forests where cool\u2010climate specialists (Prolasius and certain Chelaner) and cryptic species (mostly Solenopsis) cotnprised almost all ants. These patterns appear to be typical of those in mesic regions of Australia, and contrast with those in the arid zone where ant faunas are dominated by highly active and aggressive species of Iridomyrmex which apparently play a pivotal role in community organization. The results suggest that ant communities in mesic regions are less tightly structured than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4388224353366462027", "cites_id": ["4388224353366462027"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1986.tb00920.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S04gscwa5jwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 5, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 9, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 7, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
