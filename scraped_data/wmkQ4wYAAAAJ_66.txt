This paper examines seed bank dynamics in a tropical savanna in northern Australia, an environment characterised by frequent fire and highly seasonal rainfall. In particular, we examine the contribution of seed bank processes to the high level of resilience shown by grass-layer vegetation in relation to fire. We assess the spatial congruence between seed bank composition and extant vegetation, document temporal variation in the germinable seed bank over the annual dry season, test the effects of laboratory-applied heat and smoke treatments on seed germinability, and determine the effect of experimental fires on seed bank composition. Although dominant species were shared, the composition of the germinable seed bank was significantly different to that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=468301145088800979", "cites_id": ["468301145088800979"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X10000044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0zjtCGm9fwYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
