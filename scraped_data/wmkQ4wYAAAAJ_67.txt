On the one hand, assemblage structure is thought to be the outcome of local interactions determined by the properties of species and their responses to the local environment. Alternatively, this structure has been shown to be an emergent property of assemblages of identical individuals or of random sampling of a regional assemblage. In ants at baits, a combination of environmental stress and interspecific competition is widely held to lead to a unimodal relationship between the abundance of dominant ants and species richness. It is thought that in comparatively adverse environments, both abundance and richness are low. As habitats become more favorable, abundance increases until the abundance of dominant ants is so high that they exclude those that are subordinate and so depress richness. Here we demonstrate empirically that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10584212057878325341", "cites_id": ["10584212057878325341"], "pub_url": "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/428292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XWg-Acqs4pIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 11, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
