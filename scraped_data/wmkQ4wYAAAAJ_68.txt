The richness and species composition of ants and terrestrial spiders were examined at two contrasting times of year across three land use treatments (pastoralism, military training and undisturbed) and four landscape positions (upper slope to riparian). Ant species richness was least in the grazed sites, and a high proportion of the ant species recorded varied significantly in frequency between the grazed and the two ungrazed land uses. This variation was generally greater than that associated with landscape position. Although variation in the richness of spiders was significantly related to land\u2010use type, this effect was less pronounced than for ants, was less marked than variation associated with landscape position and was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2067626505792970135", "cites_id": ["2067626505792970135"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2002.01183.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l934LVqvsRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 7, "2004": 11, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
