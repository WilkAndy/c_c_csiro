Marked differences in vegetation of two adjacent sites (mallee and heath) are matched by pronounced differences in their associated ant faunas. Harvester ants rapidly removed a wide variety of seeds placed at baiting stations. The ants showed considerable seed-species selectivity and marked spatial variability, indicating that they may play an important role in plant distribution. The distributions of particular harvester ants appear to be determined by the availability of preferred seeds. The activities of elaiosome-collecting ants are discussed briefly."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14298217767984823038", "cites_id": ["14298217767984823038"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-7994-9_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_vrpBU55bcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 5, "1986": 5, "1987": 0, "1988": 3, "1989": 6, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
