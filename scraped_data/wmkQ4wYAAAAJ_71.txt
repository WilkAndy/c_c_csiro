This research tradition is much shorter in the 2 million square kilometres of tropical savannas in northern Australia, but has yielded several natural experiments, and three designed, manipulative, controlled field experiments (hereafter 'manipulative' experiments) of international significance (at Munmarlary, Kapalga and Kidman Springs in the Northern Territory). Here we assess the contributions of experiments, in particular the manipulative experiments, to ecological understanding and biodiversity management in Australia's savannas. Running from 1973 to 1996, the Munmarlary experiment comprised hectare-scale experimental plots with four replicated dry season fire treatments, and was designed to examine interactions between fire, landscape and biodiversity. The Kapalga experiment ran from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12962124829123075472", "cites_id": ["12962124829123075472"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/wf/WF03025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kN0mFtu34rMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 13, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
