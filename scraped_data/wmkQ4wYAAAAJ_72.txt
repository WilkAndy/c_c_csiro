Unlike other abundant taxa, they have no obvious specializations enabling them to co-exist with the highly aggressive species of Iridomyrmex that dominate these communities. Here we report results which suggest that Monomorium species owe their success to the topical application of venom alkaloids which repel other ants. The venom alkaloids (trans-2-ethyl-5-undecylpyrrolidine and trans-2-ethyl-5-tridecylpyrrolidine) of Monomorium \u201crothsteini\u201d were identified and synthesized, and the repellency to other ants of the synthetic alkaloids were tested using bioassays involving the attraction to honey baits of three native species of Iridomyrmex, three tropical \u201ctramp\u201d species, and M. \u201crothsteini\u201d itself. Repellency to all other ant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17081290795079102422", "cites_id": ["17081290795079102422"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00320805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1u_WQXrvDO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 6, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
