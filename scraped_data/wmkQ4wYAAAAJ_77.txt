A possible non-niche\u2013based explanation is that the abundance of behaviourally dominant ants is highly patchy at fine spatial scales, and subordinate species act as insinuators by preferentially occupying these gaps\u2014we refer to this as the interstitial hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we examined fine-scale patterns of ant abundance and richness according to a three-tiered competition hierarchy (dominants, subdominants and subordinates) in an Australian tropical savanna using pitfall traps spaced at 2 m intervals. Despite the presence of gaps in the fine-scale abundance of individual species, the combined abundance of dominant ants (species of Iridomyrmex, Papyirus and Oecophylla) was relatively uniform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11295064377222859021", "cites_id": ["11295064377222859021"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-011-1919-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DYmJDzUhwJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
