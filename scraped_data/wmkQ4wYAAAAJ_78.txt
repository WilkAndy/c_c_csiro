While savanna species generally exhibit high resilience to burning, there is much debate about the fire resilience of forest\u2010associated species, and the persistence of forest patches in a flammable savanna matrix. Where fire has been excluded, savanna tends on a trajectory towards forest, with an increase in forest\u2010associated plants and animal species. This study tested the idea that given the high proportion of forest\u2010associated taxa in long\u2010unburnt savanna, the fauna of these areas would be expected to exhibit less resilience to fire than the fauna in frequently burnt savannas. The study investigated the immediate and short\u2010term effects on ant assemblages of re\u2010introducing fire into long\u2010unburnt savanna in northern Australia. The ant fauna exhibited high resistance to fires, with no significant short \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5490214830427844800", "cites_id": ["5490214830427844800"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01848.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wLA7xEwpMUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
