Here we assess biodiversity surrogacy in the two most important biomes of tropical northeastern Brazil, Atlantic forest and Caatinga. We examine the extent to which species richness is correlated among taxonomic groups, and assess relationships between the richness of individual groups, and combinations of groups and total species richness. We introduce a new approach to dealing with autocorrelation between focal taxon richness and total species richness, using standardized data such that each taxon is given equal weight. Our Atlantic forest data covered seven taxa (bryophytes, pteridophytes, trees, ants, euglosine bees, birds, and mammals; total of 768 species) sampled from 12 sites; in Caatinga it was four taxa (trees, spiders, beetles and ants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13904017928948959858", "cites_id": ["13904017928948959858"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-010-9896-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ckqqxaP-9MAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 15, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
