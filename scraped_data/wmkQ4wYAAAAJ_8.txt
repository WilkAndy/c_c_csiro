The dominant fire management paradigm in these regions is the use of low\u2010intensity prescribed fire early in the dry season, to reduce the incidence of higher\u2010intensity, more extensive wildfire later in the year. This use of frequent prescribed fire to mitigate against high\u2010intensity wildfire has parallels with fire management in temperate forests of southern Australia. However, unlike in southern Australia, the ecological implications of high fire frequency have received little attention in the north. CSIRO and collaborators recently completed a landscape\u2010scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, and here we provide a synthesis of the effects of experimental fire regimes on biodiversity, with particular consideration of fire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 449, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16219094162755767492", "cites_id": ["16219094162755767492"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01441.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xEyrZTXMFeEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 11, "2007": 26, "2008": 24, "2009": 25, "2010": 33, "2011": 23, "2012": 31, "2013": 28, "2014": 29, "2015": 35, "2016": 27, "2017": 30, "2018": 30, "2019": 22, "2020": 19, "2021": 24, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
