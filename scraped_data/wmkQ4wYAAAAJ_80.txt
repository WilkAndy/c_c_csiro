Species were classified according to their habitat affinities: open\u2010savanna specialists, forest\u2010associated species or habitat generalists. We used generalized linear models to evaluate the importance of geographic (latitude, longitude and elevation) and climatic (mean temperature and three metrics of rainfall) variables as predictors of species richness.The total number of species recorded at each site varied more than twofold (from 59 to 144), and latitude was the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9840265153424489988", "cites_id": ["9840265153424489988"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.13113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BH6FZQWlj4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 13, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
