Here we examine ant communities on rehabilitated ash dams associated with a coal\u2010fired power station on the highveld of South Africa, to improve our understanding of ecosystem development on these substrates. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps at 11 ash\u2010dam sites, ranging from unrehabilitated to 9\u2010year\u2010old rehabilitated sites, as well as two adjacent natural grassland sites. Sampling was conducted on 12 occasions from March 1997 to January 1999. Forty\u2010nine ant species from 19 genera were recorded during the study. Site species richness was positively correlated with rehabilitation age, ranging from 10 to 25 at ash\u2010dam sites, compared with 28 and 34 at the two natural grassland sites. There was a humped relationship between total ant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10767276382172364248", "cites_id": ["10767276382172364248"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1061-2971.2004.00421.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2D3WddIMbZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
