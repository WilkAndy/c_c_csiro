The effectiveness of dispersal varies markedly among ant species, and combined with differential attractiveness of diaspores due to elaiosome size and composition, this raises the potential for myrmecochorous plants to target ant species that offer the highest quality dispersal services. We ask the question: Do particular physical and chemical traits of elaiosomes result in disproportionate removal of Euphorbiaceae diaspores by high-quality disperser ants in Caatinga vegetation of north-eastern Brazil? We offered seeds of five euphorb species that varied in morphological and chemical traits of elaiosomes to seed-dispersing ants. High-quality seed-disperser ants (species of Dinoponera, Ectatomma and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9295774121366065014", "cites_id": ["9295774121366065014"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-013-2789-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dg9L8E85AYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
