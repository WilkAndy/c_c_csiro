We used single\u2010season occupancy models to investigate correlates of the current distribution of C. penicillatus and dynamic occupancy models to investigate correlates of C. penicillatus local extinction.Our results show that C. penicillatus, which once occurred more widely across the island, is now restricted to parts of the island where feral cats are rarely detected and shrub density is high. Our results suggest that feral cats are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4097006101557462760", "cites_id": ["4097006101557462760"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12522", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6MbwrVd92zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
