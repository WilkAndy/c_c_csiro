However, it is unclear if such drivers interact to affect assemblage body size distributions. We asked how these two key global change drivers differentially affect the interspecific size distributions of ants, one of the most abundant and ubiquitous animal groups on earth. We also asked whether there is evidence of synergistic interactions and whether effects are related to species\u2019 trophic roles. We generated a global dataset on ant body size from 333 local ant assemblages collected by the authors across a broad range of climates and in disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We used head length (range: 0.22\u20134.55 mm) as a surrogate of body size and classified species to trophic groups. We used generalized linear models to test whether body size distributions changed with climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13236317151813557428", "cites_id": ["13236317151813557428"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.03244", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tNxBEFLYsLcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 9}}
