Many studies have examined the impacts of fire and logging separately, but few have considered them together. Here we describe the combined effects of selective logging and repeated prescribed fire on ants in eucalypt forest near Eden in south-eastern Australia. The study was conducted within 18 experimental coupes comprising three replicates of each of six treatments, representing combinations of two logging (selectively logged and unlogged) and three prescribed burning (unburnt, routine and high fire frequency over 20 years) practices. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps in two plots within each of the 18 coupes. A total of 92 species from 35 genera were recorded, with ant species richness increasing with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12342433847263826207", "cites_id": ["12342433847263826207"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709002734", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HxHr6TAiSasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
