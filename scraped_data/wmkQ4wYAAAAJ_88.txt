An understanding of the impact of different fire management regimes is essential if desired outcomes are to be achieved. Numerous studies have shown patchy and inconsistent responses of insects to fire. This may be because detection of responses to fire was contingent upon environmental conditions such as rainfall. Here we examine how ground\u2010active beetles respond to savanna fires and how detection of these responses is contingent upon the amount of rain occurring prior to sampling. We also test the extent to which family\u2010level responses are \u201ctaxonomically sufficient\u201d to reveal responses detected at the species level.Our study was part of a landscape\u2010scale, replicated field experiment at Kapalga Research Station, Kakadu National Park, in the wet\u2013dry tropics of northern Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13944888393682242009", "cites_id": ["13944888393682242009"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0086:RCDOFI]2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2cnlYRwyhsEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
