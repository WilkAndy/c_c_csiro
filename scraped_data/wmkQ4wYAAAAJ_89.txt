We present a conceptual framework for deriving variably integrated, multi-metric measures of CAD from disparate disturbance indicators. Our framework has three steps: (1) identifying the main sources of CAD in the target region, and quantifying them using data of varying levels of spatial and intensity precision; (2) classifying the sources of disturbance into general disturbance pressures, and deriving an index for each; and (3) combining the individual disturbance pressure indices into a fully integrated index that characterizes the overall level of CAD. We apply this framework to Catimbau National \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17186312649231260278", "cites_id": ["17186312649231260278"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18305211", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dlo7KEwMgu4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 10}}
