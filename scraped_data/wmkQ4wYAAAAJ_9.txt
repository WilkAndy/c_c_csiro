Conservation biology is challenged by a lack of congruence between the spatial scales of ecological research (typically involving small plots) and land management (typically involving whole landscapes). Here, I discuss spatial scaling issues as they relate to an understanding of ant communities and, consequently, their use as bioindicators in land management. Our perceptions of fundamental patterns and processes in ant communities depend on scale: taxa that are behaviorally dominant at one scale are not necessarily so at others, functional groups recognized at one scale are often inappropriate for others, and the role of competition in community structure depends on the scale of analysis. Patterns of species richness and composition, and the ability of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 435, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1294266009375743016", "cites_id": ["1294266009375743016"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271646", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KBy0BRQo9hEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 13, "2000": 25, "2001": 10, "2002": 10, "2003": 17, "2004": 17, "2005": 22, "2006": 25, "2007": 15, "2008": 20, "2009": 19, "2010": 13, "2011": 20, "2012": 12, "2013": 21, "2014": 15, "2015": 15, "2016": 22, "2017": 16, "2018": 19, "2019": 15, "2020": 20, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 9}}
