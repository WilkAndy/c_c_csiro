The key to understanding patterns of ant diversity in Australia is an understanding of its arid fauna, as this is primarily where most of Australia\u2019s highly diverse genera have radiated. Based on the 3,750 Australian ant species held at the CSIRO Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre in Darwin, I estimate that the entire Australian fauna comprises about 6,500 species, only about one-fifth of which have been described. Species richness is heavily concentrated into 11 genera, each with over 100 Australian species. Most of these occur primarily in arid and semi-arid regions, and a systematic overview is presented for five of the most important: Iridomyrmex, Melophorus, Camponotus, Monomorium and Rhytidoponera. For each genus, a comprehensive species-group framework is proposed as a basis for documenting patterns of diversity and distribution. Many of the taxa are highly generalised morphologically, and much remains to be done to resolve difficult complexes at the species level, and to resolve relationships between species-groups. An answer to the fundamental question of why ant diversity is so remarkably high in arid Australia remains elusive, but may be related to unusually high ant productivity and behavioural dominance over evolutionary time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6692180622227895419", "cites_id": ["6692180622227895419"], "pub_url": "http://antbase.org/ants/publications/21273/21273.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e3SluNFm31wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
