For Europeans, management is portrayed as a science\u2013based, strategically directed and goal\u2013oriented exercise aimed at achieving specific ecological outcomes. In contrast, landscape burning by Aboriginal people is more of an emergent property, diffusely arising from many uses of fire that serve social, cultural, and spiritual, as well as ecological, needs. Aboriginal knowledge is acquired through tradition and personal experience, rather than through the scientific paradigm of hypothesis testing. Here I argue that, in practice, science plays only a marginal role in European fire management in northern Australia. European managers often lack clearly defined goals in terms of land management outcomes, and rarely monitor the ecological effects of their management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14588829745008664573", "cites_id": ["14588829745008664573"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271705", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_d_kr1vvdcoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
