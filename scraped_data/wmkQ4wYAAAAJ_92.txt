The richest genera were Polyrhachis (22 species), Pheidole (21 species), Rhytidoponera (12 species) and Monomorium (12 species). Seven genera represented new records for the NT: Discothyrea, Prionopelta, Machomyrma, Strumigenys, Bothriomyrmex, Turneria and Pseudolasius. The most common ants were Generalised myrmicines, particularly species of Pheidole and Monomorium, and Opportunists such as species of Paratrechina, Tetramorium, Odontomachus and Rhytidoponera. This is also the case in rainforests of the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Of NT rainforest species, 59% have Torresian (tropical) affinities, which is only slightly higher than in Kimberley rainforests (48%). However, the NT harbours a far \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13922311061389121432", "cites_id": ["13922311061389121432"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO9960081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mBeXkiX8NcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
