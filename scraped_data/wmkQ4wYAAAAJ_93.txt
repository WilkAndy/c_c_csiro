Here we report on the first systematic investigation of subterranean ants in northern Australia, in order to assess the extent to which the high abundance and diversity of subterranean ants in Amazonia is apparent in tropical Australia. We use a novel sampling technique that combines elements of an attractant bait and a pitfall trap, and allows many traps to be deployed simultaneously. Our main study was conducted at three closely approximated sites in Darwin, where the local ant fauna has been intensively surveyed using conventional (above-ground) sampling techniques. The 720 traps deployed resulted in 421 species records, representing 29 species from 17 genera. Sixteen of these species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15005668956654822649", "cites_id": ["15005668956654822649"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-010-9874-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-WSEomnYPtAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 9, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
