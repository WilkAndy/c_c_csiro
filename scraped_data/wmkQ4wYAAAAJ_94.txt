There is particular interest in the extent to which long\u2010term fire exclusion can result in a shift from savanna to forest vegetation that is not easily reversed by the reintroduction of fire. This study examined changes in the structure and composition of a long\u2010unburnt site within the northern Australian savannas following an extended period of active fire exclusion (>20\u2003years), and the effect of the reintroducing fire through experimental fire regimes, including fires in the early and late dry season at a range of frequencies. After the long period of fire exclusion, the vegetation community was characterized by a well\u2010developed midstorey and canopy layer, low grass cover, substantially higher densities of woody sprouts and saplings than frequently burnt savanna. The community composition included a high proportion of rainforest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=582646182505827708", "cites_id": ["582646182505827708"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02379.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fE3_sZ35FQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 6}}
