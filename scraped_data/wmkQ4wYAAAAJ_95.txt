This paper examines scale dependency in comparative ant species richness and turnover in savannas of Australia and Brazil, which are well\u2010matched climatically but whose ant faunas have contrasting biogeographic origins. The study was conducted in savanna woodland near Darwin in northern Australia and Uberl\u00e2ndia in central Brazil. The sampling design consisted of eight 400\u2010m line transects, four in each continent, with eight pitfall traps located on and around each of 20 trees evenly spaced along each transect. Ant richness and species turnover were compared at three spatial scales: pitfalls associated with a tree, trees within a transect and transects within a savanna. The composition of the Australian and Brazilian savanna ant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6950526986479733757", "cites_id": ["6950526986479733757"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02255.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_Qvk_nc7dWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
