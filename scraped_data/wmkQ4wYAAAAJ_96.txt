However, there is limited information about how biota responds to long-term fire management, especially at a whole-of-community level. We studied community responses to different fire interval sequences resulting from planned and unplanned fires in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems in the Warren bioregion of south-west Western Australia (SWA) to determine the resilience of the biota to contrasting fire regimes. Fire history data were used to identify contrasting fire interval sequences in forest and shrubland communities for the period 1972\u20132004. We surveyed vascular plants, ants, beetles, vertebrates and macrofungi at 30 sites to investigate community-level responses to consecutive short (SS: \u22645 years), consecutive long (LL: \u226510 years), one very long (VL: 30 years), or mixed/moderate (M: 6\u20139 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11150780142619809009", "cites_id": ["11150780142619809009"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710007139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8VRV2XWHv5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
