The sites were surveyed primarily by pitfall trapping, during April (end of wet season) 1991, September (late dry season) 1991, and February (mid-wet season) 1992. A total of 111 ant species was recorded, with the most common being Iridomyrmex spp. and Rhytidoponera rufithorax. The richest genera were Melophorus (26 species), Monomorium (17), Iridomyrmex (16) and Camponotus (10) and Pheidole (10). The maj or functional groups were Dominant Dolichoderinae (Iridomyrmex spp.; 14% of the total number of species, 47% of the total number of ants in traps), Hot-climate specialists (mostly Melophorus spp.; 39%, 22%) and Generalised Myrmicinae (mostly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9154085177700814878", "cites_id": ["9154085177700814878"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO9930399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HpCG_PfXCX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
