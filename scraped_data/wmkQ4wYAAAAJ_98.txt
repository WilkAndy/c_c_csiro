There is a need to develop faunal indicators of restoration success that more comprehensively reflect changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. Ants are an ecologically dominant faunal group and are widely advocated as ecological indicators. We examine ant species and functional group responses on a chronosequence of rainforest restoration in northern Australia, and develop a novel method for selecting and using indicator species. Four sampling techniques were used to survey ants at 48 sites, from grassland, through various ages (1\u201324 years) of restoration plantings, to mature forest. From principal components analysis of seven vegetation metrics, we derived a Forest Development Index (FDI) of vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8204389302284132114", "cites_id": ["8204389302284132114"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2992", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Eh-pCZrY23EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
