Such a contrast is especially pronounced in monsoonal north-western Australia, where boundaries between rain forest and savanna are often extremely abrupt. However, in the humid tropics of north-eastern Queensland there is often an extended gradient between rain forest and savanna through eucalypt-dominated tall open forest. It is not known if ant community structure varies continuously along this gradient, or, if there is a major disjunction, where it occurs. We address this issue by sampling ants at ten sites distributed along a 6-km environmental gradient from rain forest to savanna, encompassing the crest and slopes of Mt. Lewis in North Queensland. Sampling was conducted using ground and baited arboreal pitfall traps, and yielded a total of 95 ant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "wmkQ4wYAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8929149520153841598", "cites_id": ["8929149520153841598"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-tropical-ecology/article/ant-community-structure-along-an-extended-rain-forestsavanna-gradient-in-tropical-australia/29B0FB3B7275D14E24184BFB2E9D3617", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vo8eDy626nsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 8, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
