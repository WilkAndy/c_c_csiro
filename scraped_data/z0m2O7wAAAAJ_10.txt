Methods and Results:  Saponin extracted from tea seeds was added to (1) an in\u2010vitro fermentation inoculated with rumen fluid and (2) a pure culture of Methanobrevibacter ruminantium. Methane production and expression of the methyl coenzyme\u2010M reductase subunit A (mcrA) were monitored in both cultures. Abundance of methanogens, protozoa, rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria were quantified using real\u2010time PCR, and bacterial diversity was observed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Addition of tea saponin significantly reduced methane production and mcrA gene expression in the ruminal fermentation but not with the pure culture of M. ruminantium. The abundance of protozoa and fungi were significantly decreased 50% and 79 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 290, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13377053782562550749", "cites_id": ["13377053782562550749"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/47/5/421/6700825", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3bPvYorXpLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 8, "2010": 16, "2011": 19, "2012": 23, "2013": 25, "2014": 22, "2015": 33, "2016": 27, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 21, "2020": 14, "2021": 23, "2022": 20, "2023": 5}}
