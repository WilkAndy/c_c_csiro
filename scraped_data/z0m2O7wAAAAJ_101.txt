Twenty-three pregnant heifers were allocated to four treatment groups and fed long-chopped hay (15.8 g N/kg dry matter) ad libitum and a complete mineral mixture throughout the experiment as well as 450 g molasses and 50 g urea per day during the final month of pregnancy. After calving, three groups were supplemented daily for 120 days with either 2 kg cracked rice (E), 0.4 kg formaldehyde-treated casein (P), or cracked rice (2 kg)+formaldehyde-treated casein (0.4 kg) (E+P); the unsupplemented control group had their calves weaned at 60 days post-partum. Supplemented animals had significantly higher intakes of hay (7- 1-7.3 v. 5.9 kg OM/day), weight gain (0.4-0.5 v. 0.0 kg/day) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6057950299460558224,3858743469856417138", "cites_id": ["6057950299460558224", "3858743469856417138"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9931079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kF1RcrMpElQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
