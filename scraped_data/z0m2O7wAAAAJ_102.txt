The main phenolic acids liberated on mild alkaline hydrolysis in 19 species of native and introduced grasses in North Queensland were p-coumaric and ferulic acids, with the former predominating in 16 species. Caffeic acid was found in three species and sinapic acid in trace amounts. Total acids occurred at approximately 10 g/kg in most species, but were found at 50 g/kg in one species. When five of the species were fed as the sole diet to sheep, intake and digestibility were not clearly related to phenolic acid level in the diet. However, output of hippuric acid in the urine increased with the daily dietary intake of phenolic acids, and nitrogen excreted as hippurate was equivalent to as much as 17% of the total nitrogen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13169111074783433245", "cites_id": ["13169111074783433245"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9931123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HRIh5L8UwrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
