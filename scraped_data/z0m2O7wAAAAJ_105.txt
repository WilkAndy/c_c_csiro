Insights into hydrogenotrophy in these systems could help in devising strategies to reduce ruminal methanogenesis. Reductive acetogenesis may be a significant hydrogen sink in these systems and previous molecular analyses have revealed a novel diversity of putative acetogens in the tammar wallaby forestomach. Methanogen-inhibited enrichment cultures prepared from tammar wallaby forestomach contents consumed hydrogen and produced primarily acetate. Functional gene (formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase and acetyl-CoA synthase) analyses revealed a restricted diversity of Clostridiales species as the putative acetogens in the cultures. A new acetogen (growth on H2/CO2 with acetate as primary end product) designated isolate TWA4, was obtained from the cultures. Isolate TWA4 classified within the Lachnospiraceae and demonstrated >97% rrs identity to previously isolated kangaroo acetogens. Isolate TWA4 was a potent hydrogenotroph and demonstrated excellent mixotrophic growth (concomitant consumption of hydrogen during heterotrophic growth) with glycerol. Mixotrophic growth of isolate TWA4 on glycerol resulted in increased cell densities and acetate production compared to autotrophic growth. Co-cultures with an autotrophic methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii revealed that isolate TWA4 performed reductive acetogenesis under high hydrogen concentration (>5 mM), but not at low concentrations. Under heterotrophic growth conditions, isolate TWA4 did \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4059794983764603263", "cites_id": ["4059794983764603263"], "pub_url": "https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-014-0314-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f7EzLAdKVzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
