Genetic diversity was assessed by ERIC, REP and 16\u201323S rDNA spacer polymorphisms. All ruminococci could be typed by ERIC, REP or 16\u201323S rDNA spacer, but all three typing methods had to be used in concert to differentiate closely related strains. Digestibility of lucerne (Medicago sativa), rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and spear grass (Heteropogon contortus) were assessed. Dry matter (DM) digestibility was highly correlated (> 0\u00b793) with neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility, but cellulose disc digestibility was a poor indicator of DM and NDF digestibility. Studies demonstrate the wide variation in ability of ruminococci to digest forages, and some recently isolated strains (Y1, LP\u20109155, AR67, AR71 and AR72) were superior to reference strains (FD\u20101 and Ra8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5438906989990263172", "cites_id": ["5438906989990263172"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/86/3/487/6721332", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hDnCQBfheksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
