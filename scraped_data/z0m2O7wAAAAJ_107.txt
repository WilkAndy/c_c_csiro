In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024\u2009\u00b5g/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32\u2009\u00b5g/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3341060356134866870", "cites_id": ["3341060356134866870"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.3526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tg-PNLHUXS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
