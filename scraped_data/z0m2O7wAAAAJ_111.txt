However, methanogenic archaea are present within the macropodid foregut, although there is scant understanding of these microbes. Here, an isolate taxonomically assigned to the Methanosphaera genus (Methanosphaera sp. WGK6) was recovered from the anterior sacciform forestomach contents of a Western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus). Like the human gut isolate Methanosphaera stadtmanae DSMZ 3091 T, strain WGK6 is a methylotroph with no capacity for autotrophic growth. In contrast, though with the human isolate, strain WGK6 was found to utilize ethanol to support growth, but principally as a source of reducing power. Both the WGK6 and DSMZ 3091 T genomes are very similar in terms of their size, synteny and G: C content. However, the WGK6 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13583170682013793035", "cites_id": ["13583170682013793035"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C7vuwMQdgbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
