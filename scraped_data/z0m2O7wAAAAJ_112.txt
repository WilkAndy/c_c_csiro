Over a 7-wk feeding period, birds were fed a commercial diet with or without plant extracts (Acacia decurrens, Eremophila glabra), essential oil [lemon myrtle oil (LMO)], plant secondary compounds [terpinene-4-ol and \u03b1-tops (including \u03b1-terpineol, cineole, and terpinene-4-ol)], and the antibiotic virginiamycin. Traditional culture and real-time quantitative PCR techniques were used to enumerate the numbers of C. jejuni in chicken fecal and cecal samples. In addition, BW and feed intake were recorded weekly for the calculation of BW gain and feed conversion ratio. The mean log10 counts of C. jejuni were similar (P > 0.05) across treatments. However, significantly lower levels of fecal Campylobacter counts (P < 0.05) were recorded at d 41 for the \u03b1-tops treatment by culture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8069958861033274461", "cites_id": ["8069958861033274461"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119323880", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XXzn39NA_m8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
