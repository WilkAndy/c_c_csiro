Using eight rumen-cannulated Belmont Red Composite steers [436 \u00b1 18.2 kg liveweight (LW); least squares means \u00b1 s.e.m.] fed a diet mixture of 0.85 CSIRO\u2019s Ridley beef finisher pellets and 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana); Experiment 1 compared for 7 weeks dose-dependent effects of the fermented-Monascus purpureus red rice powder (FRR) on dry matter intake (DMI), feed efficiency and tolerability. Consistent with the developed feeding methodology, the second experiment used four (461 \u00b1 18.2 kg LW) fistulated Belmont Red Composite steers to assess rumen fermentation parameters and methane emissions measured in an open-circuit respiratory chamber system over ~4 weeks.
