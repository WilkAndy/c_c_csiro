(Scrophulariaceae), a native Australian shrub, has been demonstrated to have low methanogenic potential in a batch in vitro fermentation system. The present study aimed to test longer-term effects of E. glabra on rumen fermentation characteristics, particularly methane production and the methanogen population, when included as a component of a fermentation substrate in an in vitro continuous culture system (Rusitec). E. glabra was included at 150, 250, 400 g/kg DM (EG15, EG25, and EG40) with an oaten chaff and lupin-based substrate (control). Overall, the experiment lasted 33 days, with 12 days of acclimatization, followed by two periods during which fermentation characteristics (total gas, methane and VFA productions, dry matter disappearance, pH) were measured. The number of copies of genes specifically associated with total bacteria and cellulolytic bacteria (16S rRNA gene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16678361823961755128", "cites_id": ["16678361823961755128"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996413001753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-C2tkLZxdecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
