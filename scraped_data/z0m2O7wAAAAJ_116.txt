Despite implementation of conventional control methods, people continue to become seriously ill from contaminated meat or other food products, manure-contaminated drinking and recreational water, and direct contact with ruminants. E. coli O157:H7 can cause life-threatening disease, and is a particular threat to children, through acute and chronic kidney damage. Compared with other food-borne bacteria, E. coli O157:H7 has a remarkably low infectious dose and is environmentally robust. Cattle are largely unaffected by this organism and have been identified as the major source of E. coli O157:H7 entering the human food chain. Other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli can be pathogenic to humans and there is increasing evidence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5765944842997408885", "cites_id": ["5765944842997408885"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR04129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dSRbEUnABFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
