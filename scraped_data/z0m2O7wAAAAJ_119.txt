Campylobacter jejuni colonises the lower gastrointestinal tract of poultry and during processing is spread from the gastrointestinal tract onto the surface of dressed carcasses. Controlling or eliminating C.jejuni on-farm is considered to be one of the best strategies for reducing human infection. Molecules on the cell surface of C.jejuni interact with the host to facilitate its colonisation and persistence in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry. We used a subtractive phage-display protocol to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a poultry isolate of C.jejuni with the aim of finding peptides that could be used to control this microorganism in chickens. In total, 27 phage peptides, representing 11 unique clones, were found to inhibit the growth of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10757610394181998389", "cites_id": ["10757610394181998389"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/peds/article-abstract/23/10/751/1532560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NZdEQai1SpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
