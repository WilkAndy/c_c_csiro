Sensors have been developed that can, for example, provide pH and pressure readings or monitor medication, but capsules that can provide key information about the chemical composition of the gut are still not available. Here we report a human pilot trial of an ingestible electronic capsule that can sense oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. The capsule uses a combination of thermal conductivity and semiconducting sensors, and their selectivity and sensitivity to different gases is controlled by adjusting the heating elements of the sensors. Gas profiles of the subjects were obtained while modulating gut microbial fermentative activities by altering their intake of dietary fibre. Ultrasound imaging confirmed that the oxygen-equivalent concentration profile could be used as an accurate marker for the location of the capsule.
