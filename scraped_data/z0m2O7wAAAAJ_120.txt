The main feed resources include native pasture and crop residues, which are low in nitrogen (6.2-10.6 g/kg DM) and high in fibre (676-772 g/kg DM). Nutritional deficiencies of these feeds can be alleviated by supplementation with fodder trees such as Acacia angustissima, which are multipurpose, have outstanding agronomical attributes and are rich in nitrogen (33.2-40.8 g/kg DM). However, feeding A. angustissima without adaptation caused toxicity to sheep. Rats fed diets containing 20% A. angustissima died within 2-5 d. Intake and average daily gain (6.0 and 0.5 g/d) were significantly (P 0.05) reduced in rats fed a diet containing 70% acetone extract compared to the rats fed the control diet (8.8 and 3.1 g/d). Addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) improved in-vitro gas and ammonia production from A. angustissima leaves (gas, 3.9 to 13.4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9387390459385225594", "cites_id": ["9387390459385225594"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026360912944", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eiGM4-K1RoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
