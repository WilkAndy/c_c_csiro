Low body condition score at calving (3.5f 0.1, scale 1-9) was associated with prolonged post-partum anoestrous intervals in suckled cows, but provided cows were maintaining liveweight, ovarian cyclicity resumed within 50 days if calves were weaned 70 days post-partum. This response to weaning was totally inhibited in cows that calved in low body condition that lost liveweight post-partum (Year 1). In contrast, marked levels of post-partum liveweight loss (23%) did not affect resumption of ovarian cyclicity in response to weaning (at 50 days post-parturn), or time to conception, among cows that calved with high body \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15162106398894573159", "cites_id": ["15162106398894573159"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9960927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z8bJAHCfatIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
