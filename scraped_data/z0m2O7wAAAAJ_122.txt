A. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and CGA was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. CGAs were developed using a 7\u00b75\u2005cm\u00d72\u00b75\u2005cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. It was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. Pair-wise cross-hybridization experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. CGAs were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an A. angustissima containing diet but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14107483417547974593", "cites_id": ["14107483417547974593"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.26953-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wSepcWzZx8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
