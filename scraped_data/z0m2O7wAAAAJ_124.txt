Microbial populations have been described in the gut of herbivores, omnivores and carnivores and in all zoological classes. This complex, mixed, microbial culture (comprising bacteria, ciliate and flagellate protozoa, anaerobic phycomycete/chytridiomycete fungi and bacteriophage) forms a closely integrated ecological unit with each other and the host animal, as well as playing a vital role in the normal nutritional, physiological, immunological and protective functions of the host. Development of microbial populations in the digestive tract of higher animals commences soon after birth and involves a complex process of microbial succession and many microbial and host interactions, eventually resulting in dense, stable populations inhabiting characteristic regions of the gut. The rumen is the most extensively studied and well-documented gut ecosystem because of the importance of ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats and camels) to human nutrition and the major role played by rumen microbes in the nutrition of the ruminant animal. See also: Digestive System of Mammals The ruminant foregut or stomach has evolved into three pregastric fermentation chambers (rumen, reticulum and omasum) of which the rumen is by far the largest. Ingested plant material is hydrolysed and fermented in the rumen, and microbial cells as well as undigested plant particles pass into the abomasum where gastric digestion begins (Figure 1).
