Methods and Results: A multiplex PCR method combining three primer sets for the E. coli O157:H7 genes rfbE, uidA and E. coli H7 fliC was developed and tested for sensitivity and specificity with pure cultures of 27 E. coli serotype O157 strains, 88 non\u2010O157 E. coli strains, predominantly bovine in origin and five bacterial strains other than E. coli. The PCR method was very specific in the detection of E. coli O157:H7 and O157:H\u2212 strains, and the detection limit in seeded bovine faecal samples was <10 CFU g\u22121 faeces, following an 18\u2010h enrichment at 37\u00b0C, and could be performed using crude DNA extracts as template. Conclusions: A new multiplex PCR method was developed to detect E. coli O157:H7 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10718499999334953477", "cites_id": ["10718499999334953477"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/42/4/386/6703892", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BXJi2fXCv5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
