The diets were chopped (1 cm) hay, pellets, and two mixtures of chopped/pellets in the ratio 2: 1 and 1: 2. Goats selected more pellets from the mixed diets than did sheep. DM digestibility was similar in both species, but decreased with increasing pellet content. Voluntary intake and digestible DM intake (per kg BW0.75) by goats were lower than for sheep. Reticulorumen fill increased from 166 g for goats fed chopped or pelleted diets to 250\u2013280 g per kg body weight when fed mixtures of chopped and pelleted diets. Fill in sheep was relatively constant at 221\u2013237 g per kg BW for all diets. DM content of reticulorumen digesta was higher (P< 0.01) in goats than in sheep (13.2 vs. 11.3%), whereas the mean particle size of digesta was smaller (P<0.01) in goats.
