We hypothesised that feeding pigs these SDF would stimulate Cae and DC carbohydrate fermentation, resulting in a modification of the resident bacterial communities.Five groups of six pigs were each fed one diet based on wheat starch (WS) only, or treatment diets in which some WS was replaced by 10 % AX, or 10 % MLG, a combination of 5 % AX:5 % MLG (AXMLG), or completely replaced with ground whole wheat. Post-euthanasia, Cae and DC digesta were collected for analysis of fermentative end-products, and bacterial community profiles were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14708508928999758769", "cites_id": ["14708508928999758769"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-016-1263-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sRuxIPEeH8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
