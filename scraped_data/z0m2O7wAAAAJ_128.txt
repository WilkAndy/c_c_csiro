Methods and Results: The digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) increased during co\u2010culture of xynA or pUMSX and weakly cellulolytic, but not with highly cellulolytic, ruminococci. Competition studies among xynA, pUMSX and cellulolytic consortia demonstrated that xynA was the fittest. XynA did not persist at high levels in the rumen and was undetectable after 22 days. Conclusions: The construction of recombinant xylanolytic B. fibrisolvens does improve the digestibility of fibre above that of the native, but digestibility is still less than that of the most potent fibre digesters such as ruminococci. Significance and Impact of the Study: Fibre digestion may be improved by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=740721730697744504", "cites_id": ["740721730697744504"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/90/3/388/6721493", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eNCmU32SRwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
