Like the termite hindgut and bovine rumen, key enzymes and modular structures characteristic of the \u201cfree enzyme\u201d and \u201ccellulosome\u201d paradigms of cellulose solubilization remain either poorly represented or elusive to capture by shotgun sequencing methods. Instead, multigene polysaccharide utilization loci-like systems coupled with genes encoding \u03b2-1,4-endoglucanases and \u03b2-1,4-endoxylanases\u2014which have not been previously encountered in metagenomic datasets\u2014were identified, as were a diverse set of glycoside hydrolases targeting noncellulosic polysaccharides. Furthermore, both rrs gene and other phylogenetic analyses confirmed that unique clades of the Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidales, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 238, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12503247573472681711", "cites_id": ["12503247573472681711"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1005297107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:756aS2x1hK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 16, "2012": 20, "2013": 26, "2014": 23, "2015": 25, "2016": 18, "2017": 27, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 17, "2021": 15, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
