Large among animal variation in clinical signs of acidosis, rumen metabolite concentrations, and the rumen microbiome occurred. This exploratory study investigates sources of the variation by examining associations between the genome, metabolome, and microbiome, albeit with a limited population. The broader objective is to provide a rationale for a larger field study to identify markers for susceptibility to ruminal acidosis. Initially, heifers (n = 40) allocated to five feed additive groups were fed 20-days pre-challenge with a total mixed ration and additives. Fructose (0.1% of bodyweight/day) was added for the last 10 days pre-challenge. On day 21 heifers were challenged with 1.0% of bodyweight dry matter wheat + 0.2% of bodyweight fructose + additives. Rumen samples were collected via stomach tube weekly (day 0, 7, and 14) and at five times over 3.6 h after challenge and analyzed for pH and volatile fatty acid, ammonia, D-, and L-lactate concentrations. Relative abundance of bacteria and archaea were determined using Illumina MiSeq. Genotyping was undertaken using a 150K Illumina SNPchip. Genome-wide association was performed for metabolite and microbiome measures (n = 33). Few genome associations occurred with rumen pH, concentration of acetate, propionate, total volatile fatty acids, or ammonia, or the relative abundance of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes phyla. Metabolites and microbial phyla that had markers associated and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were: acetate to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16907119866023575279", "cites_id": ["16907119866023575279"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00062/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7_5IvfAnouoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
