Cattle were introduced to the leucaena pastures for an initial period varying from 17 to 71 days. Fourteen to fifteen animals were then sampled for (1) urine and blood plasma to determine toxicity status as indicated by concentration of DHP; (2) faeces for estimation of diet composition; and (3) rumen fluid for detection of S. jonesii by nested polymerase PCR analysis. After a further 42\u201356 days, animals were resampled as before to confirm toxicity status and inoculated with the in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=538397302075546943", "cites_id": ["538397302075546943"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/AN12301", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P909Yn7FeAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
