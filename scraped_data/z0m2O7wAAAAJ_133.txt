Hay was either chopped into 1 cm lengths or ground (3.2 mm screen) and pelleted and fed in either form or as a 2:1 or 1: 2 ratio, respectively. Responses in chewing activity and reticulo-ruminal motility were compared in a replicated 4 \u00d7 4 Latin square design. Goats ate 14% less DM than sheep (28.8 g/kg bodyweight vs. 33.5) yet spent 55% more time eating (251 min/d vs. 162), and 15% more time ruminating (635 min/d vs. 552). Frequency of primary and secondary reticulo-ruminal contractions were similar in both species when corrected for intake and digestible DM intake, respectively, but there were fewer secondary contractions in goats during eating and rest. Eating was associated with the highest frequency of both contraction types. There were no significant species by treatment interactions. In both species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16455764721432054140", "cites_id": ["16455764721432054140"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092144889290189B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fMlc6NOeXuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
