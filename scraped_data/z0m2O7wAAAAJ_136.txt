If these biofilm communities are to be properly characterized by metagenomics methods, then the microbial desorption methods used must ensure the phylogenetic diversity and genetic potential recovered is biologically valid. To that end, we describe here two different methods for desorbing microbes tightly adherent to plant biomass; and used PCR-DGGE analyses of the Bacteria and Archaea rrs genes to show both these desorption methods were effective in recovering the adherent microbial biofilm with no apparent biases in microbe recovery. We also present a derivation of the \u201crepeated bead beating and column (RBB+C) purification\u201d method of DNA extraction that results in the recovery of high molecular weight DNA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11150813965842031807", "cites_id": ["11150813965842031807"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-010-9745-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v6R67jimv5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
