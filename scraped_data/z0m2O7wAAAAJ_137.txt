It has a high nitrogen content and possesses many advantageous growth characteristics such a high leaf yield, drought tolerance, adaptation to acidic infertile soils and large temperature variations. However, the widespread implementation of supplementation practices with A. angustissima is currently impeded by reports of anti-nutritive/toxic effects in feeding trials with both monogastric and ruminant animals. Although the plant contains an array of secondary metabolites in high concentrations there have been few documented reports of toxicity under conventional feeding. The intent of this paper is to review the current knowledge on the secondary plant metabolites in A. angustissima, their toxic and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1785594292639103781", "cites_id": ["1785594292639103781"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037784010700363X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jfu3dYy0xxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
