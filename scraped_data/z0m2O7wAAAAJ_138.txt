There was a marked decrease in forestomach motility 4\u20136 h after dosing with the plant and motility continued to be depressed throughout the course of the disease. The effect of lantana on motility was characterized by a decrease in the number and median amplitude of forestomach movements. This was in contrast to the effect of starvation which caused a decrease in only the number of forestomach movements and even this effect was less severe than in lantana\u2010poisoned animals. The effects of lantana on the components of the reflex which controls rumen motility were examined. No evidence was found for a direct effect of lantana toxins on the stretch and tactile receptors in the reticulum; on the vagus nerves; on the gastric centre or on the muscle of the forestomach. However, evidence was found to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11397651510796343485", "cites_id": ["11397651510796343485"], "pub_url": "https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/expphysiol.1983.sp002725", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vdi1ZqmXLJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
