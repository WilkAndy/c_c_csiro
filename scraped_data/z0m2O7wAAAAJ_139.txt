In a 5 \u00d7 5 Latin square design, 10 Nellore steers with ruminal and duodenal cannulas (292 \u00b1 28 kg BW) were fed one of the five following dietary lipid sources in the concentrate, as follow: (1) no additional fat (WF); (2) palm oil (PO) derived from the Palmaceae plant Orbignya oleifera; (3) linseed oil (LO); (4) protected fat (PF); and (5) whole soybeans (WS). The dry matter intake (DMI) was greater for the animals supplemented with WF than for those supplemented with PO, PF, and WS. The DM digestibility was 11% greater for the animals in the WF group than for those in the PO group. The animals in the PO group had greater duodenal flows of capric (C10:0), lauric (C12:0) and myristic (C14:0) saturated fatty acids (SFA) than did animals in the other groups.
