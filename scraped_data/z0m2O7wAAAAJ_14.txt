MCSWEENEY, B. PALMER, R. BUNCH AND D.O. KRAUSE. 2001. Aims: To determine the effect of condensed tannins in Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra) on rumen microbial function. Methods and Results: Microbial populations, ruminal protein synthesis and fermentation end\u2010products were measured in sheep fed roughage hay supplemented with calliandra (30%), with and without inclusions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to counteract the effect of tannin. Molecular and conventional enumeration techniques were used to quantify rumen bacteria, fungi and protozoa, and protein synthesis was predicted from estimates of urinary purine excretion. The total number of cellulolytic bacteria, including populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus spp., was significantly lower in sheep supplemented with calliandra and these populations increased when animals were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11649166616764943730", "cites_id": ["11649166616764943730"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/90/1/78/6721445", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cg2daVEnqqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 12, "2011": 13, "2012": 14, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 17, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
