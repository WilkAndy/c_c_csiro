Twenty-four pregnant heifers were allocated to three treatment groups all fed roughage hay ad libitum. The dietary treatments were: (1) nil supplement controls, (2) cracked maize (1 kg) plus formaldehyde treated sunflower seed meal (0.5 kg) daily for 60 days post-partum, (3) supplement 2 from 1-2 months pre-partum to 60 days post-partum. Supplementation did not affect hay intake prior to calving (6.5 kg/day), but significantly increased (P < 0.05) intake by approximately 50% after calving compared with a 20% increase in the controls. Maternal liveweight, adjusted for the weight of the foetus and gravid uterus, was 345 kg in all groups at 5 weeks before calving. This weight declined by 6 kg in unsupplemented animals and increased by 16 kg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3858743469856417138", "cites_id": ["3858743469856417138"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9931063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cmUmyL0CjTUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
