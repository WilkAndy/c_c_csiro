A number of non-protein amino acids have been identified in the leaves of A. angustissima and these have been linked to toxicity in ruminants. The non-protein amino acid 4-n-acetyl-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (ADAB) has been shown to be the major amino acid in the leaves of A. angustissima. The current study aimed to identify micro-organisms from the rumen environment capable of degrading ADAB by using a defined rumen-simulating media with an amino acid extract from A. angustissima. A mixed enrichment culture was obtained that exhibited substantial ADAB-degrading ability. Attempts to isolate an ADAB-degrading micro-organism were carried out, however no isolates were able to degrade ADAB in pure culture. This enrichment culture was also able to degrade the non-protein amino acids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8673946558466578437", "cites_id": ["8673946558466578437"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840105000714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BVgfOnAMYHgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
