The effect of A and B sequence contractions of the reticulo-rumen on passage rate of digesta was compared in buffaloes and cattle fed low quality rhodes grass. 2. Both species ate the same amount per unit body weight but buffaloes spent 53% more time ruminating than cattle. 3. Buffaloes had fewer A and B sequence contractions each day and the rate of these contractions during eating, ruminating and at rest were slower. 4. A larger pool of fine feed particles in the rumen of buffaloes, generated by extra ruminating activity was associated with the 30% shorter mean residence time of particulate matter in the forestomach compared with cattle. 5. It is concluded that the difference in the number and frequency of contractions between the species was insufficient to affect passage rate of digesta from the stomach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=179218950141242909", "cites_id": ["179218950141242909"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/2575949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:He4vhK-2fAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
