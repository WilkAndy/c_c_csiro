The accessibility of the cellulosic components in wheat chaff was increased, as demonstrated by the increased concentration of sugars produced by exposure to the ultrasound treatment prior to enzyme addition. Pretreatment with ultrasound increased the concentration of lignin degradation products (guaiacol and syringol) obtained from wheat chaff after enzyme addition. In vitro digestibility of wheat chaff was also enhanced by the ultrasonics pretreatment in combination with treatment with enzyme extracts. Degradation was enhanced with the use of a mixture of the enzyme extracts compared to that for a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13789769343034374944", "cites_id": ["13789769343034374944"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417714001035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ILsi-icaX78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
