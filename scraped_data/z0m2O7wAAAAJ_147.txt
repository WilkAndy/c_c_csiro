An anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming, xylanolytic bacterium with high hydroxy cinnamic acid esterase activity was isolated from the gut of the grass-eating termite Tumilitermes pastinator. The bacterium was motile and rod-shaped, stained gram-positive, had an eight-layered cell envelope, and formed endospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA indicated that the bacterium is closely related to Clostridium xylanolyticum and is grouped with polysaccharolytic strains of clostridia. A wide range of carbohydrates were fermented, and growth was stimulated by either xylan or cellobiose as substrates. The bacterium hydrolysed and then hydrogenated the hydroxy cinnamic acids (ferulic and p-coumaric acids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9012233597081844614", "cites_id": ["9012233597081844614"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002030050753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hnvnKrXiEX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
