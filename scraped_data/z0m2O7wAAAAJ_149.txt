Twenty pregnant heifers grazing during the dry season of northern Australia were allocated to either N-supplemented or un-supplemented diets and monitored through the seasons. Rumen fluid, blood, and feces were analyzed before supplementation (mid-dry season), after two months supplementation (late-dry season), and post supplementation (wet season). Supplementation increased average daily weight gain (ADWG), rumen NH3\u2013N, branched fatty acids, butyrate and acetic:propionic ratio, and decreased plasma \u03b415N. The supplement promoted bacterial populations involved in hemicellulose and pectin degradation and ammonia assimilation: Bacteroidales BS11, Cyanobacteria, and Prevotella spp. During the dry season, fibrolytic populations were promoted: the bacteria Fibrobacter, Cyanobacteria and Kiritimatiellaeota groups; the fungi Cyllamyces; and the protozoa Ostracodinium. The wet season increased the abundances of rumen protozoa and fungi populations, with increases of bacterial families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae; the protozoa Entodinium and Eudiplodinium; the fungi Pecoramyces; and the archaea Methanosphera. In conclusion, the rumen microbiota of cattle grazing in a tropical grassland is distinctive from published studies that mainly describe ruminants consuming better quality diets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13734226839352104215", "cites_id": ["13734226839352104215"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/849712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F9U3GIvGmb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
