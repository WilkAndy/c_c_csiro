We have isolated a dominant bacterial species (WG-1) from the wallaby microbiota affiliated with the family Succinivibrionaceae and implicated in lower methane emissions from starch-containing diets. This was achieved by using a partial reconstruction of the bacterium\u2019s metabolism from binned metagenomic data (nitrogen and carbohydrate utilization pathways and antibiotic resistance) to devise cultivation-based strategies that produced axenic WG-1 cultures. Pure-culture studies confirm that the bacterium is capnophilic and produces succinate, further explaining a microbiological basis for lower methane emissions from macropodids. This knowledge also provides new strategic targets for redirecting fermentation and reducing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 184, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4625210368021287369", "cites_id": ["4625210368021287369"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1205760", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ydFcBVMMMEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 12, "2016": 12, "2017": 23, "2018": 18, "2019": 18, "2020": 17, "2021": 19, "2022": 20, "2023": 9}}
