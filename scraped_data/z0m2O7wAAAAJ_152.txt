Bacteria most important in fibre digestion and utilization are Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Of these four species, the Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus are the most cellulolytic and can potentially be manipulated genetically, or ecologically, for increased ruminal cellulolysis. However, transformation systems have only been developed for B. fibrisolvens. The taxonomy of Ruminococcus, and B. fibrisolvens is complex and 16S rDNA sequence indicates that both are polyphyletic. In addition to delineating phylogenetic relationships between bacteria, 16S rRNA based studies provide molecular targets to enable placement of ruminal manipulations in a phylogenetic context. These target sites can also be used to design tracking protocols to measure persistence of introduced bacteria into the rumen."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2288531191152519812", "cites_id": ["2288531191152519812"], "pub_url": "http://plato.acadiau.ca/isme/Symposium13/krause.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hCoMQv5-wh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
