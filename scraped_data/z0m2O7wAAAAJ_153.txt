When the contents of the rumen were removed from sheep three or six days after giving them lantana and placed into the empty rumens of normal sheep, the recipient sheep became intoxicated. Administration of purgatives such as raw linseed oil or Glauber's salts orally, or administration of bethanechol subcutaneously failed to stimulate rumen motility in lantana poisoned sheep and are therefore unlikely to be effective in eliminating residual toxin from the rumen. Intravenous administration of a multiple electrolyte solution to lantana poisoned sheep improved rumen motility, and motility was increased even more when 2\u20133 1 of freshly collected rumen liquid was given orally to rehydrated animals. However, these treatments did not restore motility to normal and animals treated by these methods did not survive the intoxications.
