Utilizing such a procedure can be especially invaluable for investigating the performance of antimicrobial materials related to human and animal related infections. In this pilot study, it is shown that the rumen of a fistulated animal provides an excellent live laboratory for assessing the properties of antimicrobial materials. We investigate microbial colonization onto model nanocomposites based on silver (Ag) nanoparticles at different concentrations into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). With implantable devices posing a major risk for hospital-acquired infections, the present study provides a viable solution to understand microbial colonization with the potential to reduce the incidence of infection through the introduction of Ag nanoparticles at the optimum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11616864556509733446", "cites_id": ["11616864556509733446"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11515", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RqKW7sNkN6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
