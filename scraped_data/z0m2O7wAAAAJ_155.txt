This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that age (non-rumination, transition and rumination) and feeding type [Supplemental feeding (S) vs. Grazing (G)] could alter ruminal microbial diversity and maturation of host mucosal innate immune system in goat kids. MiSeq sequencing was applied to investigate ruminal microbial composition and diversity, and RT-PCR was used to test expression of immune-related genes in ruminal mucosa. Results showed that higher (P < 0.05) relative abundances of Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Methanobrevibacter.gottschalkii, Neocallimastix, Anoplodinium\u2013Diplodinium, and Polyplastron, and lower relative abundance of Methanosphaera (P = 0.042) were detected in the rumen of S kids when compared to those in G kids. The expression of genes encoding TLRs, IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2 and TICAM2 was down-regulated (P < 0.01), while expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins was up-regulated (P < 0.05) in the ruminal mucosa of S kids when compared to that in G kids. Moreover, irrespective of feeding type, relative abundances of ruminal Prevotella, Fibrobacter, Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio, Methanobrevibacter, Neocallimastix, and Entodinium increased with age. The expression of most genes encoding TLRs and cytokines increased (P < 0.05) from day 0 to 7, while expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins declined with age (P < 0.05). This study revealed that the composition of each microbial domain changed as animals grew, and these changes might be associated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8357004441858972458,4969241646714843975", "cites_id": ["8357004441858972458", "4969241646714843975"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01655/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KptdN0ML-nMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
