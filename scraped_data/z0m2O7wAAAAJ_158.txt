However, it was shown that the passage of ingesta into the small intestine decreased markedly a few hours after the toxin was given and it is suggested that absorption from all areas of the gastrointestinal tract is important for the progression of the disease. When bile was diverted away from the small intestine, animals were still intoxicated by lantana. This indicates that bile is not important for absorption of lantana toxins. Other experiments indicated that the lantana toxins are transported to the liver mainly in the portal blood."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8647708754718268957", "cites_id": ["8647708754718268957"], "pub_url": "https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jat.2550010110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HZ4EfkvVAngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 3, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
