Animals were fed in three consecutive feeding periods, a high-grain basal diet for 14 d (BD period) then a period of progressive addition of TSS to the basal diet up to 30\u2009g/d for 20 d (TSS period), followed by the basal diet for 13 d without TSS (BDP post-control period).The study found that TSS supplementation decreased the amount of the protozoal genus Entodinium and increased Polyplastron and Eudiplodinium genera. During BDP period, the protozoa community of steers did not return to the protozoal profiles observed in BD period, with higher proportions of Metadinium and Eudiplodinium and lower Isotricha. The addition of TSS was found to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9735958133775324986", "cites_id": ["9735958133775324986"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40104-020-00491-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OtfA31YSHYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
