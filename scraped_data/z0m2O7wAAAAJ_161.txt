The amino acid and peptide requirements of the bacterium were investigated under different culturing conditions. The growth of strain MFA1 and its fluoroacetate degradation rate were enhanced by peptide-rich protein hydrolysates (tryptone and yeast extract) compared to casamino acid, an amino acid-rich protein hydrolysate. Complete utilization and preference for arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glycine, and histidine as free amino acids from yeast extract were observed, while the utilization of serine, threonine, and lysine in free form and peptide-bound glutamate was stimulated during growth on fluoroacetate. A predominant peptide in yeast extract preferentially utilized by strain MFA1 was partially characterized by high-liquid performance chromatography-mass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15832918644917898507", "cites_id": ["15832918644917898507"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-015-0641-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C439A5_TudsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
