In addition, whether commercial lairage management practices promote or diminish any diet-induced responses on the contamination of carcasses was also investigated. After 13 days on the dietary treatments total faecal E. coli numbers were approximately one log lower in the roughage (R) and roughage +50% molasses (RM) diets compared with grain (G) fed animals, this difference varying between 0.5 and 1 log at lairage. Fermentation patterns were similar in the R and RM diets whereas decreased pH and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7455242127570077130", "cites_id": ["7455242127570077130"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160507005922", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yoVXKDdXdmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
