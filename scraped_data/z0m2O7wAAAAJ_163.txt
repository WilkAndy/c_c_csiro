Methods and Results: Eight strains (H17c, E14, LP1309, LP1028, AR11a, OB156, LP210B and LP461A) of Bu. fibrisolvens were transformed by the Gram\u2010positive vector pUB110. A xylanase expression/secretion cassette containing Bu. fibrisolvens promoter and signal peptide elements fused to catalytic domain II of the N. patriciarum xylanase A cDNA (xynANp) was inserted into pUB110 to create the plasmid pUBxynA. pUBxynA was used to transform seven of the Bu. fibrisolvens strains transformed by pUB110. In strain H17c pUBxynA, which produced native xylanase, 2\u00b746 U mg\u22121 total xylanase activity was produced with 45% extracellular xylanase. In strain H17c pUMSX, 0\u00b774 U mg\u22121 total xylanase activity was produced with 98 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4130345552441825306", "cites_id": ["4130345552441825306"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/93/1/122/6721937", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GtjofGXvUTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
