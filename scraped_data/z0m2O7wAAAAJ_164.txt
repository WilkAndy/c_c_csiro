Methods and Results:\u2002 Nontarget bacterial cells were added to the sample prior to RNA extraction, facilitating the co\u2010precipitation of target RNA along with nontarget RNA and thus enhancing the recovery. This method was developed using a serial dilution of log phase target cells (E. coli O157:H7), combined with a high number of nontarget cells (E. coli K12). Cells were lysed by a bead beating method followed by RNA purification using a commercial kit. A reverse\u2010transcriptase PCR assay for the detection of rfbE gene in E. coli O157:H7 was used to demonstrate that the procedure increased the recovery of amplifiable RNA target with a detection limit of approximately 63 CFU ml\u22121 in cultures and 27\u00b75 CFU ml \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9289488825461374567", "cites_id": ["9289488825461374567"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/47/5/399/6700889", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z_6Vct7k6oAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
