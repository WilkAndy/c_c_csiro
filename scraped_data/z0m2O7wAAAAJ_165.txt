Acidity and a short digesta residence time in the stomach select for acid\u2013tolerant and fast\u2013growing bacteria, of which lactic acid producing bacteria are the most numerous. In the hindgut, the neutral pH (pH\u2265 7.0), availability of fibre and the long residence time of digesta support a diverse bacterial population. Fibre\u2013digesting bacteria predominate in the hindgut when the diet contains high levels of fibre. However, a change from a normal fibre\u2013rich diet to a starch\u2013rich diet will alter the bacterial population and the end products of bacterial fermentation in the hindgut. When starch supply is plentiful, the amount of volatile fatty acids and lactic acid produced may exceed the capacities of the GI tract and associated body tissues to absorb and metabolize them. This can lead to development of fermentative acidosis and laminitis. Further knowledge about the microbial population in the GI tract of the horse would assist nutritionists and veterinary practitioners to develop better dietary practices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9783534941871278533", "cites_id": ["9783534941871278533"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/71224347/Cellulolytic_and_lactic_acid_bacteria_in20211003-1128-9le5j.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xQncuTEZxocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
