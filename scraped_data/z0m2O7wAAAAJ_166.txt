Six, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g of powder TSS were dissolved during 5, 7, 4, 3, 3 and 2 days, respectively, and infused into the rumen of four rumen-cannulated Brahman steers (234 \u00b1 13.6 kg LW; least-squares means \u00b1 s.e.m.) or mixed in the basal diet [BD: 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay plus a high-grain feed (0.85)] of two non-cannulated (253 \u00b1 19.3 kg) steers. Overall, DMI was not affected, by the sequential infusion of TSS (5.3 \u00b1 0.15 kg) or addition to the BD (5.4 \u00b1 0.18 kg), but relative to all diets, 6 g of TSS supplementation reduced DMI (P < 0.05), while the administration above 30 g of the supplement was associated with significantly (P < 0.001) reduced DMI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1462776151303378663", "cites_id": ["1462776151303378663"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/AN15582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:59ZZ1CjTTBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
