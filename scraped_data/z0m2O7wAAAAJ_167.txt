They have been found in a variety of anaerobic ecosystems, including sediments, wastewater treatment systems, soils and animal gut systems. In recent years, acetogens have received attention as a hydrogenotrophic population that may play a role in reducing methane (CH4) emissions from ruminant animals. During ruminal fermentation, methanogenic archaea reduce CO2 (4H2+CO2 \u2192 CH4+2H2O) or methylated compounds to CH4. Ruminal methanogenesis represents a loss of 2-12% of gross energy of ingested feed and contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. If methanogenesis could be suppressed in the rumen, acetogenesis may serve as an effective alternative hydrogen sink, resulting in an energy gain for the ruminant through the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14002119736134515150", "cites_id": ["14002119736134515150"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9781780644325.0292", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zrnIrraFUcIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
