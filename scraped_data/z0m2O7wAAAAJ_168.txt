NPAAs, such as ODAP and DABA, are among those compounds. In addition to the direct adverse effects on animals by NPAAs, studies also have shown that ODAP, a major non-protein amino acid in some forage legumes, inhibited the growth of some non-ruminal microorganisms. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of ODAP and DABA on in vitro dry matter (DM) digestibility of lucerne chaff as means to test their effects on ruminal microorganisms. The results showed the in vitro DM digestibility of lucerne chaff at 24, 48 and 72h was significantly reduced by 18.6, 11.0 and 8.6% when three levels of ODAP (40.67, 81.34 and 122\u03bcg/ml, C18 reverse phase chromatography-fractionated extracts from L. sativus) were included in the medium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12570932371696209174", "cites_id": ["12570932371696209174"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840105000672", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fk1pbmPsdK4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
