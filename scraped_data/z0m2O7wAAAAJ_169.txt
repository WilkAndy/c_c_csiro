The experiments involved the examination of relationships between Na balance, plasma aldosterone and renin, Na content of faeces and urine, and salivary Na:K ratio in these animals. The variables were measured at monthly intervals for 6 months in goats receiving low or high Na diets, and during 1 month in sheep offered a low Na and low K diet alone or supplemented with 1.5 or 3.0% K. Aldosterone was closely correlated with salivary Na, K and Na:K ratio for both goats and sheep, but there was little relationship indicated between aldosterone and the other variables, either by the raw or logarithmically transformed data. Sodium balance was poorly correlated with all variables, probably because of the unavoidable inaccuracies in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7282891307570423915", "cites_id": ["7282891307570423915"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR9880935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a-iDzQ4HEmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
