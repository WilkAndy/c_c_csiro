Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been a widely utilized polymer within permeable membranes as it possesses high intrinsic flux. However, little attention has been placed on the effect of crosslinking temperatures during synthesis. In this work, PDMS membranes were prepared using a range of crosslinking temperatures and evaluated for their gas permeation towards CO2, N2 and CH4. The investigation of the effect of the crosslinking temperature on gas permeation of PDMS membranes revealed an optimum temperature of 75 \u00b0C at which the permeability increased (for N2 from 360 to 590 Barrer, for CO2 from 3190 to 3970 Barrer, and for CH4 from 850 to 1000 Barrer).
