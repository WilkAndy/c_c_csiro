The LD50 of this compound in ruminants is about 0.3 mg/kg body weight. A previous study showed that sheep inoculated orally with Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens microbes, transformed with fluoroacetate dehalogenase plasmid (pBHf), provided markedly reduced toxic symptoms when challenged with the poison (Gregg et al. 1998).Twenty Angus steers (10 control and 10 test) were used to test whether pBHf-bearing B. fibrisolvens strains, when inoculated orally, were able to protect against fluoroacetate. Under appropriate containment conditions, uninoculated control animals were fed 3 equal doses of 0.11 mg/kg body weight of sodium monofluoroacetate, at 0, 3, and 6 h, and their behaviour and heart rates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9970583490392641022", "cites_id": ["9970583490392641022"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SA/SA0401138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_k06rNugXooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2}}
