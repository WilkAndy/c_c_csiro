An important role for these unusual microorganisms in ruminant nutrition has been proposed over the course of the past decade or so. The significance of this role was based largely on in vitro studies of anaerobic fungi. However, there was very little direct evidence from studies with animals to support this position until recently. It is now known that anaerobic fungi make a significant contribution to the intake of poor quality pasture. There may also be a contribution to forage digestion in the rumen, although much of the fermentation of structural polysaccharides in the rumen is attributed to anaerobic bacteria, either alone or in association with ciliate protozoa. Fungal populations in the rumen are known to be limited by a low sulphur content of both rough pastures and poor quality crop residues. Where appropriate, fertilisation of the growing pasture with sulphur improves the sulphur content of feed which subsequently is eaten in greater quantities by ruminants with ruminal populations of anaerobic fungi returned to 'normal'. Alternatively, supplementing the feed with a suitable sulphur compound is also effective in improving the voluntary intake of digestible feed both with crop residues and harvested rough pastures. In addition, considerable potential exists for the selection and intra-ruminal inoculation of superior strains of anaerobic fungi obtained from either domesticated or wild herbivorous mammals. These possible mechanisms for improving forage intake by ruminants grazing rough pastures through the manipulation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14825038861014195156", "cites_id": ["14825038861014195156"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QM9600037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1NscNEwevc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
