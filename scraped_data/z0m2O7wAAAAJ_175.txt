Sixteen stall-housed Bos indicus steers na\u00efve to leucaena were fed varying combinations of forage-harvested leucaena and Chloris gayana (Rhodes grass). Dietary treatments, offered at 25 g dry matter/kg LW.day, were: 25% leucaena; 50% leucaena; 100% leucaena; and 50% leucaena, switched to 50% Medicago sativa (lucerne) after 6 weeks at time of inoculation. The experiment was 10 weeks in duration, consisting of a 6-week pre-inoculation period, followed by inoculation with cultured S. jonesii, and a 4-week post-inoculation period. Mean daily dry matter intake was recorded. Twenty-four-hour urine collections and rumen fluid samples were obtained weekly for estimation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17075324371420342705", "cites_id": ["17075324371420342705"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/an17853", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sWkU_wu99-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
