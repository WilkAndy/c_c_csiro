The fhs sequences obtained from BCM\u2010untreated, BCM\u2010treated, fumarate\u2010untreated and fumarate\u2010treated bovine rumen were categorized into homoacetogens and nonhomoacetogenic bacteria by homoacetogen similarity scores. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that most of the fhs sequences categorized into homoacetogens were divided into nine clusters, which were in close agreement with a result shown in a self\u2010organizing map. The diversity of the fhs sequences from the BCM\u2010treated rumen was significantly different from those from BCM\u2010non\u2010treated rumen. Principal component analysis also showed that addition of BCM to the rumen altered the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14813930824572457540", "cites_id": ["14813930824572457540"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/asj.12072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RNLZ7Zinlc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
