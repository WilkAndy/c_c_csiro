Methods and Results:\u2002 A metal\u2010dye chelate, zirconium\u2010xylenol orange was used to detect fluoride ions released from a fluorinated substrate through microbial metabolism. Depolymerised zirconium reagent gave the greatest visual contrast for the presence of fluoride compared to more polymerised forms of zirconium reagent. The sensitivity of the assay was greatest when the molar ratio of depolymerised zirconium to xylenol orange was 1 : 2. Using depolymerised zirconium and xylenol orange (150 and 300 nmol l\u22121 respectively), the assay could detect a fluoride application spot (5 mmol l\u22121) containing 50 nmoles of fluoride ions. Most media constituents were well tolerated by the assay, although phosphate ions needed to be restricted to 0\u00b71 g l\u22121 and some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13375010069709977083", "cites_id": ["13375010069709977083"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/53/4/417/6702935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-_VVaMuUnbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
