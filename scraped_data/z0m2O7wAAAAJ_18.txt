Inflammatory bowel disease is associated with quantitative and qualitative alterations in the microbiota. Early characterization of the microbiota involved culture-dependent techniques. The advent of metagenomic techniques, however, allows for structural and functional characterization using culture-independent methods. Changes in diversity, together with quantitative alterations in specific bacterial species, have been identified. The functional significance of these changes, and their pathogenic role, remain to be elucidated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5498973532370179052", "cites_id": ["5498973532370179052"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article-abstract/18/2/372/4607860", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7BMz-kpHUEwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 13, "2014": 17, "2015": 19, "2016": 18, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
