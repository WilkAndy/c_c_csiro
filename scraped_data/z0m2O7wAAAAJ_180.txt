The northern cattle industry produces about 4.5% of Australia\u2019s total GHG emissions. Livestock methane emissions can be reduced through adoption of changed management and new technologies. If the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) is passed through parliament, there will be financial incentives to reduce emissions. A major challenge in Australia\u2019s north is simply measuring methane emissions. However in recent years, significant advancement in this area has been achieved. A range of methods are now available experimentally and are being developed specifically for extensive grazing conditions. In particular the use of open-path laser techniques to measure methane concentration in the atmosphere down-wind of grazing cattle can be used to estimate emissions from cattle on pasture. By validating these data with intensive techniques from animals in chambers we now have a viable approach to measure emissions from cattle under extensive grazing conditions. Currently, the laser technique is being used in a number of commercial situations in northern Australia to assess the variability in methane emissions across different production systems and land types. These data will inform new models that will give more accurate predictions of methane emissions per animal, per hectare and per unit product. Such information is critical if we are to quantify the effects of management and mitigation technologies on methane emissions. These developments will ensure that management decisions can be made to optimise productivity and carbon outcomes.
