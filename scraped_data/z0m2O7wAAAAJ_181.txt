Practical methods of increasing intake of the harvested plant were also investigated. The low intake by sheep of calopo was not due to its toxicity since supplementation with 500 g/day of ground calopo via the ruminal fistula did not depress voluntary consumption of lucerne hay more than when an equivalent amount of siratro was given. Treatment of the plant with the 'taste-modifiers' monosodium glutumate (2% dry matter fed) and molasses (5%), or with sodium hydroxide 4% w/w or its molar equivalent of potassium hydroxide was associated with an immediate and sustained increase in organic matter intake of about 40%. This intake is similar to that of other tropical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1849989092486600300", "cites_id": ["1849989092486600300"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA9860659", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bNYCKEd7rBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
