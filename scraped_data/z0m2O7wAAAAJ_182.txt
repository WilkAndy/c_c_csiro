The rumen bacterium Synergistes jonesii is able to degrade these DHP isomers into non-toxic end products. In this study we developed new PCR-based assays to improve the specificity and sensitivity of detection of S. jonesii in the rumen. Using these new assays in a survey of ruminants from different countries, S. jonesii appeared to be ubiquitous rather than isolated geographically. The bacterium was present as a minor population (< 10 6 cells/mL) in the rumen and was usually comprised of several genetic variants of the species. Although the indigenous nature of S. jonesii could imply animals are protected from toxicity, the relative abundance of the bacterium, potential variation in DHP-degrading ability of genetic variants, and amount of leucaena in the diet may determine the ability of the resident population in the rumen to protect the animal from toxicity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10478153094138222098", "cites_id": ["10478153094138222098"], "pub_url": "http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2346-37752019000200154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EtZENrngaZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
