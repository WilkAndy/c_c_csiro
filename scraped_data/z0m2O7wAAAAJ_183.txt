Urea was provided in all treatments to compensate for the N deficiency (<0.6%) in the roughages. In experiment 1, steers (333 \u00b1 9.5 kg liveweight) were fed Angleton grass (Dicanthium aristatum) supplemented with S in equivalent amounts as either MPS (6.0 g/day) or sodium sulfate (9.56 g/day). Supplementation of Angelton grass with either sulfate or MPS resulted in an apparent increase in flow of rumen microbial protein from the rumen. Sulfur supplementation did not significantly change whole tract dry matter digestibility or intake, even though sulfate and MPS supplementation was associated with an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=854645266020431200", "cites_id": ["854645266020431200"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/animal/article/stimulatory-effect-of-the-organic-sulfur-supplement-mercaptopropane-sulfonic-acid-on-cellulolytic-rumen-microorganisms-and-microbial-protein-synthesis-in-cattle-fed-low-sulfur-roughages/37738C0B5FDCF246AC4DACC9F8EA631E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YPUdYldP3AsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
