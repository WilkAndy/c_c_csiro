These involve rumenotomy and suture of the cannula into the rumen, followed by closure of the skin and underlying muscle with sutures (Piercy 1973). This preparation can be stabilised and leakage of digesta reduced by placing a disc of surgical mesh over the stem of the cannula so that it reinforces the seal between the serosa of the rumen and the peritoneum (Grovum 1988). Alternatively, the intact rumen wall can be sutured to the skin along the edges of a laparotomy incision. Once adhesion has occurred a cannula is placed into the rumen through an incision (Dougherty 1955). Another method involves applying a metal clamp to a fold of the rumen wall exteriorised through a laparotomy incision and then allowing a fistula to develop by the gradual necrosis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10861319497178192678", "cites_id": ["10861319497178192678"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1989.tb13589.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JptUdYkou5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
