In ruminants, they are responsible for producing abundant amounts of methane during digestion of food, but selected bioactive plants and compounds may inhibit this activity. Recently, we have identified that, Biserrula pelecinus L. (biserrula) is one such plant and the current study investigated the specific anti-methanogenic activity of the plant. Bioassay-guided extraction and fractionation, coupled with in vitro fermentation batch culture were used to select the most bioactive fractions of biserrula. The four fractions were then tested against five species of methanogens grown in pure culture. Fraction bioactivity was assessed by measuring methane production and amplification of the methanogen mcrA gene. Treatments that showed bioactivity were subcultured in fresh broth without the bioactive fraction to distinguish \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1471736394980046292", "cites_id": ["1471736394980046292"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996416300312", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1LXMIXSobBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
