In this work, PFG NMR was used to examine the impact of chemical modification on properties of solubilized high amylose starches obtained from heated (121 \u00b0C for 15 min) starch suspensions (0.5% w/w). The starches examined were high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and high amylose maize starch chemically modified with acetate (HAMSA), propionate (HAMSP) and butyrate (HAMSB) at degree of substitution (DS) of 0.2. The hydrothermal treatment solubilized 3.36\u20134.96% of the starch in all samples, corresponding to concentrations of 10.36\u201310.91 \u03bcM on glucose equivalents basis. The hydrodynamic radii of the starches were 30 \u00c5 (HAMS), 45 \u00c5 (HAMSB), 60\u201370 \u00c5 (HAMSA & HAMSP). Contrary to expectations, the radii did not increase with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7635604724627888519", "cites_id": ["7635604724627888519"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268005X14000496", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h1m9uAoe92kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
