Methane is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas. Around 500-600 Tg of CH4/yr is emitted globally. Of this, about 74% is biologically generated almost exclusively by methanogens that belong to the phylum Euryarchaeota and grouped under six orders. Ruminant methanogens generate 13-19% of global methane output which is the largest of anthropogenic emissions. Among the rumen methanogens, Rumen Cluster \u2018C\u2019(RCC), an unclassified and uncultured archaeal clade, represents 15.8-80.9% of rumen archaea (Janssen and Kirs, 2008), which has the potential to contribute significantly to ruminant derived methane. Phylogenetically, RCC distantly affiliate to a non-methanogenic order-Thermoplasmatales. Analysis of 16S rDNA identified members of RCC in diverse habitats including digestive tracts of insects, birds, cattle, pigs, camels, macropod marsupials and man. However, their position as methanogens was unresolved because of a lack of pure cultures, despite methane producing, non-axenic archaeal cultures being enriched from these sites. Here, we report the isolation and characterisation of the first methanogen from the RCC clade, strain DOK-1 in pure culture, that in turn could help understand the role of this large group in the rumen. We propose the nomenclature Methanoplasma gallocaecorum strain DOK-1, for this novel methanogen.Material and methods Caecal contents from broiler chickens were anaerobically pooled and inoculated into 10 ml Balch tubes containing anaerobic BRN enrichment media (Rea et al., 2007). Methylotrophic methanogens were enriched by adding methanol, mono-, di-and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2487151400306845282", "cites_id": ["2487151400306845282"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cemil-Kurekci-2/publication/311966031_A_methylotrophic_methanogen_isolate_from_the_Thermoplasmatales_affiliated_RCC_clade_may_provide_insight_into_the_role_of_this_group_in_the_rumen/links/5865805208ae8fce490c2639/A-methylotrophic-methanogen-isolate-from-the-Thermoplasmatales-affiliated-RCC-clade-may-provide-insight-into-the-role-of-this-group-in-the-rumen.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YqbnZQUjhCIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
