The inhibitory activity of 309 bacteria, isolated on several agar media, was assessed by a microgel assay performed in 96-well microtiter plates. Fifty-three isolates secreted inhibitory compounds with a molecular weight of less than 1,000. In 12 isolates, the inhibitory activity was attributable to compounds other than lactic or acetic acid. These compounds were highly heat tolerant, with varying sensitivity to digestion by proteolytic enzymes. The inhibitory isolates were identified as lactic acid\u2013producing bacteria on the basis of a combination of analyses, including 16S-rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 16S-rDNA gene sequences, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1410082611809589760", "cites_id": ["1410082611809589760"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1410082611809589760&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AJrdHKqekRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
