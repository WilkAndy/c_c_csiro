The complex microbial community that resides within the yak rumen is responsible for fermentation and contributes to its climatic adaptation. This study aimed to characterize the rumen microbiota responses to wide seasonal variations, especially those necessary for survival in the cold seasons.In the present study, we performed 16s rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the seasonal variations in microbiota composition, diversity and associated volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in yak rumen. The results showed that rumen microbiota were dominated by Bacteroides (72.13%\u201378.54%) and Firmicutes; the relative abundance of Firmicutes was higher in summer (17.44%) than in winter (10.67%; p < 0.05).
