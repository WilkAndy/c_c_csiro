Rumen microorganisms potentially play a vital role in the adaptation of indigenous ruminants to this harsh environment. Aims The present study aimed to investigate the diversity of rumen bacteria in ruminants (yak and Tibetan sheep) indigenous to the QTP and introduced species (cattle and crossbred sheep). Methods Rumen bacterial composition and \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity of indigenous and introduced ruminants were analysed based on 16s rDNA sequence data. Key results Most of the sequences from all animals were affiliated with phylum Bacteroidetes (67.6\u201384.0%), followed by Firmicutes (11.6\u201321.0%). The \u03b2 diversity (Bray\u2013Curtis and weighted-Unifrac distance matrices) of bacteria was significantly different among ruminant species yak (Bos grunniens), cattle (Bos taurus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=928049823846803334", "cites_id": ["928049823846803334"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/AN20204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hqdA1GUY4QwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
