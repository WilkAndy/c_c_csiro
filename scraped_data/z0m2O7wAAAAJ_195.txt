Here, we report on the isolation of a rumen bacterium, strain C12\u20138 that degrades FA under anaerobic conditions. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed this bacterium belonged to the Pyramidobacter genus within the Synergistetes phylum and was 98% similar to Pyramidobacter piscolens W5455 isolated from the human oral cavity. Transmission electron microscopy showed the cell envelope to be unusual, with only one membrane and no obvious external wall. Growth and FA degradation were enhanced by peptide-rich protein hydrolysates but not carbohydrates. End products of metabolism were mainly acetate, propionate/isovalerate and isobutyrate. Strain C12-8 preferentially used peptide-bound amino acids rather than free amino acids.
