After 24 h incubation, methanogens in sodium salt of 2-bromoethanesulphonic acid (BES)-added fluids was reduced to 10.4% of control (P< 0.01). BES did not significantly influence the number of bacteria and R. flavefaciens. However, the number of F. succinogenes in BES-treated fluid was 50.0% higher than in control (P< 0.01). Population density of fungi fell by 61.9%(P< 0.01) in comparison with control. Addition with BES changed the rumen microbiota and had a varying influence on different microbes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6589433971438143684", "cites_id": ["6589433971438143684"], "pub_url": "http://www.jafs.com.pl/Shifts-of-rumen-microbial-population-detected-by-nreal-time-PCR-when-methanogenesis-is-inhibited,74464,0,2.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xEh24khfclsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
