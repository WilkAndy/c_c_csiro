It can be a source of high-quality forage for cattle grazing tropical grass-based pastures that are seasonally deficient in the nitrogen content required for adequate levels of performance. Leucaena contains bioactive compounds that may reduce methanogenesis in the rumen, helping to achieve Australia's goal to make red meat production carbon neutral by 2030.Aim A study was undertaken to evaluate the response in animal performance and methane production to increasing percentages of leucaena in a hay-based diet.Methods Growing steers were fed diets containing 0%, 18%, 36% and 48% leucaena. Intake, liveweight gain, methane production and yield were measured in a cross-over trial with two modern cultivars of leucaena (Redlands and Wondergraze).
