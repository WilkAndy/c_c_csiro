With the emergence of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and related \u2018omics\u2019 approaches, along with demands to better utilize lignocellulose materials as a feedstock for second-generation biofuels, these gut microbiomes are thought to be a potential source of novel biotechnologies relevant to meeting these needs. This review provides an insight into the new findings that have arisen from the (meta)genomic analysis of specialist cellulolytic bacteria and gut microbiomes of herbivorous insects, ruminants, native Australian marsupials, and other obligate herbivores. In addition to there being more of the same in terms of cellulases and cellulosomes, there also appears to be something \u2018new\u2019 in terms of the compositional and functional attributes of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6631656782371086230", "cites_id": ["6631656782371086230"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166909000615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lt-JIbVgCFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 14, "2012": 6, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 20, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
