Traditionally, pathogenic gut microorganisms have been controlled by antibiotic growth promoters [8]. Use of such supplements in livestock is being phased out because of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant human-pathogens [4]. The use of growth promoters as feed supplements in livestock was banned by the European Union at the start of 2006 and similar bans are under review in Australia [16]. A number of approaches, such as vaccination, probiotics, chemical inhibitors and dietary manipulation are being considered for reducing these organisms in livestock. One possible control strategy is the use of natural antimicrobial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7180476603870088811", "cites_id": ["7180476603870088811"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-3297-3_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aw6ua20tpmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
