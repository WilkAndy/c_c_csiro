These animal-microbe relationships have been described as competitive, cooperative or combinatorial, and all provide a variety of functional and metabolic capabilities that are relevant to host animal nutrition, health and well-being. The evolutionary adaptations of Australia?s marsupial herbivores have been relatively well characterised and favour both the cooperative and combinatorial animal-microbe models. Kangaroos and wallabies possess the cooperative model: the foregut functions as an obligate combustion chamber for a microbiome specialised in the release of nutrients from plant biomass, and which precedes a region of acid and pepsinogen secretions by the host. The common ringtail possum and wombats are examples of Australian herbivores with specialised caecal and colonic obligate combustion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18100543272643600349", "cites_id": ["18100543272643600349"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MA/MA07107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3R-CpzQMMvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
