Ruminal bacteria that ferment protein or peptides in the presence of tannins may benefit digestion of these diets. Bacteria from the rumina of sheep and goats fed Calliandra calothyrsus (3.6% N and 6% condensed tannin) were isolated on proteinaceous agar medium overlaid with either condensed (calliandra tannin) or hydrolyzable (tannic acid) tannin. Fifteen genotypes were identified, based on 16S ribosomal DNA-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and all were proteolytic and fermented peptides to ammonia. Ten of the isolates grew to high optical density (OD) on carbohydrates (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, xylan, starch, and maltose), while the other isolates did not utilize or had low growth on these substrates. In pure culture, representative isolates were unable to ferment protein that was present in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7338730386886473676", "cites_id": ["7338730386886473676"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.65.7.3075-3083.1999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zLe7lGdo2GUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 10, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
