Packed cell volume and total plasma protein increased after dosing with lantana and plasma osmolality increased markedly in the days prior to death. During the early stages of the disease plasma electrolytes were unchanged except for a decrease in potassium, but electrolyte levels varied late in the disease. A metabolic acidosis gradually developed as the disease progressed. It is concluded that fluid, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are minor in the early stages of intoxication, but in the terminal stages of the disease, some major changes occur."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3050811598716505846", "cites_id": ["3050811598716505846"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/6636505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9o4jMvyoVioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
