The severity of intoxication was used to estimate the extent of absorption. It was found that the toxins were absorbed most readily from the small intestine but considerable amounts were also absorbed from the stomachs and large intestine. When rumen contents were collected from intoxicated sheep up to 6 days after lantana was given and administered to normal sheep, the recipient animals become intoxicated and the donor animals recovered. This indicates that a large proportion of the administered dose of toxin is retained in the rumen and that continuous absorption of the toxins is necessary to maintain the disease. Experiments on rumen motility demonstrated that rumen stasis occurs within a few hours of administering \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5682811699229336194", "cites_id": ["5682811699229336194"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041010183902106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gqL_sSFn3U4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
