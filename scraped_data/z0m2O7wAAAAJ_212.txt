Consequently, the use of natural feed additives such as tea seed saponins (TSSP) might have the potential to meet animal regulations for reducing methanogenesis without deleterious effects on productivity and food security. These studies aim to determine the optimal level of TSSP supplementation that reduces methane emissions associated with research on the rumen physiology and microbial ecology of fed cattle maintaining productivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5059142082499267000", "cites_id": ["5059142082499267000"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5059142082499267000&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uEmZZ-uuNUYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2}}
