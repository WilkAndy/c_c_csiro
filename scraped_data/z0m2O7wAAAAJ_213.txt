Four rumen fistulated swamp buffaloes were assigned according to a cross-over design to receive 3.0 kg/hd/d dried Leucaena leaf supplementation. Swamp buffaloes were fed with rice straw ad libitum and dried Leucaena leaf was supplemented at 3.0 kg/hd/d. Apparent digestibility of CP were increased (P< 0.05) in buffaloes supplemented with Leucaena leaf. The average values of BUN were 1.26, 13.08 mg/dl and NH3 were 8.9, 16.1 mg/dl in control and in the supplemented group, respectively. Moreover, there were differences in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) in Leucaena leaf supplemented than in the control group. The efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (EMPS) were increased by Leucaena leaf supplemented group. Population sizes of the target total bacteria, predominant cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen were influenced by dietary treatments (P< 0.05), as enumerated by real-time PCR assays. The strain of Synnergistes jonesii was pesented in swamp buffaloes fed supplemented with Leucaena leaf. Moreover, total DHP concentration was related to Leucaena and mimosine intake. Based on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of dried Leucaena leaf at 3 kg/hd/d could be a good protein source for swamp buffaloes to improve nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation and microbial protein synthesis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13304476719982317496", "cites_id": ["13304476719982317496"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr-Shahzad-Akbar-Khan/publication/337414238_Antibiogram_Analysis_of_Staphylococcus_aureus_Isolated_from_Mastitic_Milk_Samples_of_Buffaloes_in_District_Bhimber_Azad_Kashmir/links/5dd633fca6fdcc2b1fa8f621/Antibiogram-Analysis-of-Staphylococcus-aureus-Isolated-from-Mastitic-Milk-Samples-of-Buffaloes-in-District-Bhimber-Azad-Kashmir.pdf#page=637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uA8AMRb_orgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
