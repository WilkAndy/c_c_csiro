A faster and more accurate method for identifying microorganisms is through the sequencing of its ribosomal gene. Classification of microorganisms by ribosomal gene sequencing has become widely accepted within the scientific community. Although this method is quite definitive in its ability to identify the microorganism being studied, it usually involves a pure culture and then the cloning and sequencing of its ribosomal gene. In order to look at complex communities and uncultured microorganisms, many researches have removed the culturing step and moved towards the generation of 16S clone libraries (see Chapter 5.1). Data generated from numerous 16S clone libraries from countless environments have produced databases full of ribosomal sequences that may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17900013840647522628", "cites_id": ["17900013840647522628"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/1-4020-3791-0_12.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RAlf7r-fafgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
