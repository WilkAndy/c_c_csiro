The principal phenolic compounds are the flavones, apigenin and luteolin, but low concentrations of condensed tannins, the isoflavonoid daidzein and the alkaloid sparteine have also been detected in some samples. No flavonols have been detected. There is a strong relationship between the concentration of phenolic compounds in tagasaste and its palatability. Furthermore, digestibility of tagasaste is relatively high throughout the year, thereby implicating intake as the major factor influencing the seasonality of liveweight performance of livestock grazing tagasaste. Despite confirmation of the presence of a number of secondary metabolites in tagasaste, there remains an urgent need to screen tagasaste for all possible compounds of this kind in order to fully understand the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6020963774105829904", "cites_id": ["6020963774105829904"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6020963774105829904&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EMIS8abCjlMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
