Twelve lactating goats were dosed orally with endosulfan (1 mg/kg body weight per day) for 28 days. Groups of 3 animals were killed on days 1, 8, 15, and 21 after endosulfan treatment ended and their tissues examined for the presence of endosulfan. Total residues of \u03b1 and \u03b2 endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate (mg/kg) were detected in kidney (0.29), gastro\u2010intestinal tract (0.20), liver (0.12), brain (0.06), muscle and spleen (0.04), lung and heart (0.01) and milk (0.02) on the flrst sampllng day but within 15 days, concentrations had fallen to < 0.01 mg/kg in all tissues except kidney (0.20). Endosulfan could not be detected in animals 21 days after dosing had ceased. The residue in milk could only be detected on day 1 of sampling. This study indicates that kidney rather than fatty tissue should be used to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7238233061441799467", "cites_id": ["7238233061441799467"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1993.tb15141.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KwW6nJ5ec2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2}}
