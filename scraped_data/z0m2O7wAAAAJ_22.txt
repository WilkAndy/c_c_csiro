We characterized the mucosa\u2010associated microbiota at the time of surgical resection and 6 months later to identify bacterial profiles associated with recurrence and remission.Tissue samples were collected from surgical resection specimens in 12 Crohn's disease patients, and at 6 months postoperative colonoscopy from the neoterminal ileum and anastomosis. Endoscopic recurrence was assessed using the Rutgeerts score. Microbiota was characterized using microarray and 454 pyrosequencing. Longitudinal comparisons were made within patients, and cross\u2010sectional comparisons made with colonoscopic biopsies from the terminal ileum and cecum of 10 healthy subjects.Microbiota of healthy subjects had high diversity and was dominated by the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6456197251534618500", "cites_id": ["6456197251534618500"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgh.12694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hP-SoTEFmVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 19, "2017": 24, "2018": 15, "2019": 17, "2020": 15, "2021": 22, "2022": 18, "2023": 7}}
