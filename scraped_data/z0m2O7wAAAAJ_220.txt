The IR gas-sensing devices also measure temperature and pressure near the sensors and the design isolates the electronics and battery from exposure to gases. Membranes were developed that allow the desired gases to diffuse through to the sensors while excluding corrosive hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Performance of the prototype IR devices was tested in cattle and sheep fed once a day as a proof-of-concept. Concentrations of expired gases from respiration chambers were compared with the concentrations obtained by the IR gas-sensing device within the rumen digesta. Direct measurements of rumen gas cap samples demonstrate a similar gas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10594179964906412268", "cites_id": ["10594179964906412268"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/AN15581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7JjONowWBpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
