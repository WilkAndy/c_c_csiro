Verano containing < 0.5 g Na/kg. Growth rate, OM intake and digestibility were not affected by level of Na intake (1.42 g/d vs. 0.33 g/d) in goats even though Na secretion in saliva and loss in urine was actively restricted by elevated plasma aldosterone concentration in the low Na group. OM and Na intake (2.58 g/d) were relatively higher in steers and consequently there were no signs of active Na conservation. In goats, unavoidable Na loss in faeces and urine were calculated from regression equations to be 0.14 g and 0.001 g, respectively. Calculated daily Na maintenance requirements for a 20 kg goat and 200 kg steer are less than 0.33 g/d and 1.88 g/d \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13204737379885616503", "cites_id": ["13204737379885616503"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092144889290164Y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d41ncK-mQLcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
