These animals are a major global source of methane, a greenhouse gas produced during the degradation of organic matter by micro-organisms in the foregut of ruminant livestock. Chemical inhibition of methanogenic micro-organisms has been reported; however, associated improvements in feed digestion and livestock productivity have not been consistently demonstrated. Gene-based technologies have the potential to contribute new knowledge of the rumen microbial populations involved in these processes, which will assist in identifying feeding practices that lead to methane abatement and improved livestock productivity. For small-scale farmers, feeding interventions that achieve greenhouse gas abatement need also to be associated with improved feed conversion efficiency and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4914193302919286968", "cites_id": ["4914193302919286968"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/b105256.pdf#page=394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uJAbwsW4MkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
