The objective was to identify markers for ruminal acidosis. Genome wide association was performed on Holstein heifers (n= 34 samples with quality DNA out of 40) that were allocated to 5 feed additive groups. Heifers were fed twice daily a 62% forage: 38% concentrate total mixed ration at 1.25% of bodyweight (BW) dry matter (DM)/d for a 20-d adaptation period with their additive (s). Fructose (0.1% of BW/d) was added to the ration for the last 10 d of adaptation. On d-21 heifers were challenged with a ration consisting of 1% of BW DM wheat and 0.2% of BW fructose plus their additive (s). Stomach tube rumen samples were collected weekly and at 5 time points over 3.6 h after consumption of the challenge ration on d-21 and analyzed for pH, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3917997058385711844", "cites_id": ["3917997058385711844"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/5f9e283f713a4f7060213926e41f9ee9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=49113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5BIb8JCFXzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
