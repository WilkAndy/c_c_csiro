Heifers were fed twice daily a 62% forage:38% concentrate total mixed ration at 1.25% of BW DM/d for a 20-d adaptation period with their additive or additives. Fructose (0.1% of BW/d) was added to the ration for the last 10 d of adaptation. On d 21, heifers were challenged with a ration consisting of 1.0% of BW DM wheat and 0.2% of BW fructose plus their additive or additives. Stomach tube rumen samples were collected 3.6 h after consumption of the challenge ration and analyzed for pH; ammonia, d- and l-lactate, and VFA; and histamine concentrations and total bacteria.
