Subsequent studies in tropical ruminants and wild herbivores have highlighted the high levels than can occur in some diets and the extensive microbial modification and degradation that can occur in the tract. This paper reviews aspects of plant phenolics as they relate to ruminant nutrition in tropical or semi-arid environments in which some forage plants contain high levels of phenolic compounds. Effects range from occasional acute toxicity of hydrolysable tannins, to acetate-releasing microbial degradations that apparently enable certain phenolics to act as nutrients. The most important and complex effects are those due to tannin-protein interactions. Although these can clearly reduce feed intake, nutrient digestibilities, and protein availability, many of the interactions are still \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13604351364411063994", "cites_id": ["13604351364411063994"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR9960829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:un5Sq3xdzLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 11, "2006": 7, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
