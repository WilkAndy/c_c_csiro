Previous studies have largely employed methodologies that failed to reveal patterns generally obscured by inter-subject variability. To overcome this problem we describe the use of numerical ecology methods to analyse data produced using a gut microbe-specific phylogenetic microarray. DNA samples were prepared from biopsy tissue collected from the caecum, transverse, sigmoid and rectum of 10 patients following normal colonoscopy (5 males and 5 females, mean age 56 years). Fluorescently labeled cRNA was prepared for each sample and hybridized to a DNA microarray consisting of 766 unique probes for gut bacteria. We then used analysis with respect to instrumental variables applied to correspondence analysis, which is a method often employed in numerical ecology; but only recently applied to microarray data. This type of analysis allows for the \u201csubtraction\u201d of effects (e.g. subject), which then allows the remaining effects to be effectively compared in a statistically valid fashion. Consistent with previous studies, the diversity profiles generated possessed a marked inter-subject variability. However, we were also able to identify significant differences in the profiles on the basis of sex. Streptococcus and Ruminococcus genera were more abundant in females; and males possessed a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. Furthermore, when the subject effect was subtracted, we observed for the first time evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes with respect to biopsy site \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12692783511584202367", "cites_id": ["12692783511584202367"], "pub_url": "https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/99373", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f17pwlrTJbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
