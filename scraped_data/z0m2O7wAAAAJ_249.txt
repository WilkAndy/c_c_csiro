The botanical composition of the understorcy depends on age of the plantation. shade, burning, and method of grazing management. The feed quality of the understorey is a function of the plant species present and their stage of growth. Shade can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on the quality and yield of the undergrowth. Consumption of Pinus needles causes digestibility, carcass quality and reproductive problems. Many tropical grasses and legumes can be introduced successfully to Pinus plantations and thus improve both stocking rate and animal performance. Higher livestock production can be achieved through agroforestry systems using tree and shrub legumes. both by continuity of feed supply and through higher quality feed. Several species have been proven to be satisfactory and are extensively used. Limitations exist in using some tree and shrub fodders because of the presence of anti-nutrients or secondary compounds. Innovative methods using introduced rumen microorganisms may overcome some of these limitations.RAPID development in industrial and urban sectors in. many developing countries has depleted the availability of natural grazing lands. This has resulted in a need not only to improve productivity from existing grazing land but also to use alternative lands for grazing (for example, under plantation crops such as rubber, oil palm, coconut and pine). The grazing of ruminants under plantation crops is becoming a common practice in many tropical countries. Plantation crops are established with wide spacings which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2101637933009142580", "cites_id": ["2101637933009142580"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/134709/files/PR055.pdf#page=62", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NAN_q5CEKh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
