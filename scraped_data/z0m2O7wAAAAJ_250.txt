There are reported differences in the distribution of the lesions in different species and the clinical manifestations of the disease also vary. In budgerigars affected with Budgerigar Fledgling Disease, infection in young nestlings produces either an acute, fatal disease or a more chronic disease in which feather abnormalities predominate. In macaws, Amazon parrots and conures the disease also affects nestlings albeit older than budgerigars. The disease in Agapornis sp., Neophema splendida and finches has occurred in fledged birds and young adults and presents as a rapidly fatal disease with no specific clinical signs.
