Newer cultivars have the potential to extend adoption of the species to higher rainfall (>600\u2013700mm), frost-free areas of Australia.Aim We compared productivity, nutritional value and animal performance of two leucaena cultivars, new psyllid-resistant Redlands and the 2010-released Wondergraze, under continuous grazing management in a higher rainfall environment.Methods Growing steers were allocated to replicated established stands of Wondergraze or Redlands with inter-row mixed grass\u2013legume pasture from January to July 2021. Pasture and leucaena were characterised for biomass and nutritive characteristics. Botanical composition was measured. Liveweight gain, rumen fermentation, and leucaena mimosine breakdown products were measured in grazing steers.Key results \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/AN22341", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:21LKjoFBM_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
