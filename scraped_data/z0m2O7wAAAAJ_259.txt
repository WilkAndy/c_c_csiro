It is thought that organic forms of nitrogen and sulfur are used more efficiently for growth and function of the rumen than the inorganic nutrients. A trial was undertaken in pregnant heifers grazing a poor-quality dry season diet in the Northern Territory. The animals received three lick supplements containing varying forms of organic and inorganic N. No significant differences on animal performance and rumen fermentation parameters were observed between supplements. Animals were initially deficient for rumen ammonia-N (15.8 mg/L) and BUN (4.7 mg/100 mL) concentration. All nitrogen supplements led to a significant improvement in ammonia N (24.7\u201331.8 mg/L) but levels remained deficient until the wet season and availability of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/618458", "cites_per_year": {}}
