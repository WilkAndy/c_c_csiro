The metabolism of rumen bacteria, which strongly discriminates against 15 N utilisation, may contribute to this link but little is known about the role of individual bacteria. In this study, we characterised the \u0394 15 N of three metabolically different rumen bacteria, a cellulolytic ammonia-consuming, a hyper-ammonia producing and a proteolytic organism, grown in pure culture with different N sources and levels. The N isotopic signatures significantly changed across the 3 rumen bacteria. Although we failed to observe a higher \u0394 15 N bacteria-substrate when proteolysis and NH 3 production was favoured, our results confirm a strong 15 N depletion with the NH 3-consuming bacterium. This may suggest that 15 N depleted NH 3-consuming bacteria improve the NUE in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/978-90-8686-891-9_60", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lbhjI7t7xZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
