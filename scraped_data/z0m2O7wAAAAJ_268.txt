Their effects on the data sets\u2019 characteristics and normalization efficiencies, as measured by several  -diversity metrics, were compared. For both data sets, subsampling to the median rather than the minimum number appeared to improve the analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/99319", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5UCVLmVtvGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
