CH4 is also an important marker of farming productivity, because it is associated with the conversion of feed to product in livestock. Consequently, measurement of enteric CH4 is emerging as an important research topic. In this review, we briefly describe the conversion of carbohydrate to CH4 by the bacterial community within gut, and highlight some of the key host\u2013microbiome interactions. We then provide a picture of current progress in techniques for measuring enteric CH4, the context in which these technologies are used, and the challenges faced. We also discuss solutions to existing problems and new approaches currently in development."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10844400838727185285", "cites_id": ["10844400838727185285"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016777991500222X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hTNIUhsNf5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 14, "2018": 26, "2019": 21, "2020": 29, "2021": 12, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
