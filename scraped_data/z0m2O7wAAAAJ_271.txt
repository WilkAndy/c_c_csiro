The incidence of IBD in IA, who live traditional lifestyles in rural communities, is exceedingly rare. Australian health surveys of IA reveal a high level of childhood infections but no cases of IBD [1]. Similarly low rates of IBD were noted in Indigenous Canadians [2]. The aetiology of IBD is unknown but is thought to be due to a dysregulated immune response to an environmental trigger in a genetically susceptible host. An imbalance in the composition of gut microbiota, or \u201cdysbiosis\u201d, may be the trigger. Urbanisation may alter the exposure to environmental microorganisms and lead to dysbiosis. We hypothesise that IA have a distinct gut microbial profile, which may account for their low incidence of IBD.Aim: To characterise the tissue adherent gut microbiota in IA, patients with Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and healthy controls with normal mucosa (HN). Methods: Tissue samples from the terminal ileum and colon were obtained by colonoscopy from IA, HN, patients with CD and UC. Custom phylogenetic microarrays based on 16S rRNA gene sequences from gastrointestinal bacteria were employed to detect microbial diversity. Differences in relative abundance of microbial populations between groups were verified using Correspondence Analysis (CA) and Between group analysis (BGA) from \u2018R package\u2019with ade4 and made4 library. Results: 63 patients were recruited (15 IA, 21 CD, 17 UC, 10 HN). There were significant differences (p= 0.001) in the gut microbial profiles between the groups (CD, UC, HN and IA) using BGA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seungha-Kang/publication/269951129_Tu1693_Indigenous_Australians_IA_Have_a_Distinctive_Gut_Microbial_Profile_Compared_to_Patients_With_Inflammatory_Bowel_Disease_IBD_and_Non_Indigenous_Controls/links/6090c34292851c490fb5293d/Tu1693-Indigenous-Australians-IA-Have-a-Distinctive-Gut-Microbial-Profile-Compared-to-Patients-With-Inflammatory-Bowel-Disease-IBD-and-Non-Indigenous-Controls.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_tX16XUSozgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
