In an attempt to clarify the toxic action, we investigated the major urinary metabolites resulting from dosing of sheep with the HT, tannic acid; its simplest and major phenolic component, gallic acid; and the HT-containing and toxic Terminalia oblongata. Phenolic metabolites were separated by HPLC and their structures investigated by proton and 13C NMR. Gallic acid was less toxic (w/w) than tannic acid. Comparison of urinary metabolites from rumen and abomasal administration indicated that decarboxylation and reductive dehydroxylation of phenolics occurred principally in the rumen and a significant proportion was totally degraded. Rumen metabolism appeared to prevent toxicity from gallic and tannic acid at dose rates of <0.4 g/kg liveweight per day.
