We evaluated the ability of butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB) supplement to promote the growth of particular gut bacteria in athletes. The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled intervention. Athletes (n= 23 males and n= 18 females) were randomly divided into two groups and ingested 20g HAMSB or low amylose maize starch (LAMS) twice daily for 28 days. Dietary intakes were recorded and faeces, saliva and blood collected on days 0, 10 and 28. HAMSB supplementation decreased faecal pH on day 10 (HAMSB 6.75\u00b10.12 and LAMS 7.05\u00b10.08, P0. 01) and 28 (HAMSB 6.86\u00b10.07 and LAMS 7.10\u00b10.09, P0. 03). HAMSB increased free butyrate concentration at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP101238&sb=RECENT&n=21&rpp=50&page=47&tr=5490&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
