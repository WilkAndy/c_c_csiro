Reductive acetogenesis is an alternative hydrogen-utilising pathway to methanogenesis in the rumen and has potential as a strategy for reducing ruminant greenhouse gas emissions. The obligatory anaerobic bacteria responsible for reductive acetogenesis are known as homoacetogens. Homoacetogens use the acetyl-CoA pathway to reduce carbon dioxide to acetate, and most are able to use this pathway for growth on hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the sole energy source. Homoacetogens are present in the rumen and molecular tools are necessary to further investigate their ecology. The aim of the present work was to identify DNA sequences of genes present in homoacetogens that may be suitable as targets for the development of functional-group molecular tools for these microorganisms. The genes investigated were those of three key enzymes in the acetyl-CoA pathway: formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) and acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS). Several batch fermentation systems inoculated with rumen microbes were established, with {sup 13}C-carbonate as the principal carbon source, and in the presence or absence of methanogen inhibitors. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was performed on samples to reveal minimal gross differences in community \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21298474", "cites_per_year": {}}
