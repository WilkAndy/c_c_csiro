In northern Australia, cattle are used mainly for the production of beef, whereas in India, cattle and buffalo are used more for milk production, which is an important protein source for Indians. The common factor limiting ruminant production in both locations is the quality of the feed available for production. In both India and northern Australia ruminants depend mainly on crop residues, stubble and native pastures which are high in lignocellulose. Feed with a high proportion of lignocellulose is poorly digestible making it difficult for the animals to derive the nutrients they require for production. The dairy industry in India and the beef industry in northern Australia would both benefit from new technologies that could improve the utilisation of low quality roughages. CSIRO in Australia had developed research which was aimed at improving productivity of sheep grazing poor quality feed by stimulating rumen fungal populations. This project extended that research by developing two new technologies that have the potential to improve the digestibility of the fibre component of the diet of ruminants so that milk and meat production will keep pace with the growth of the human population. These technologies involved the use of a nutritional supplement to selectively enhance fibre degrading activity of anaerobic fungi in the rumen and a living fungal supplement.The project was undertaken by scientists at CSIRO Livestock Industries in Brisbane, Australia and at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-03/Final%20Report%20for%20AH-1997-058.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xXCL5BoD_Z4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
