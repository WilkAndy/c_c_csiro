These changes include shift in the size of regional livestock populations and in the types of management and feeding systems under which ruminant livestock are held, and increased demand of a wider range of quality w attributes from animal agriculture, not just of the products themselves but also of the methods used in their production. The livestock sector will need to respond to new challenges of increasing livestock productivity while protecting environment and human health and conserving biodiversity and natural resources.
