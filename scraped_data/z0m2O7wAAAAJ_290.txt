Prod", "volume": "27", "abstract": "Rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic organisms, such as E. coli O157: H7, is extremely important in the food safety industry. The United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recently announced changes to their policy regarding E. coli O157: H7. These changes mean that the onus lies squarely with suppliers to the US to prove that the product is safe and free from E. coli O157: H7. A zero tolerance policy for the presence of the organism is currently in place (http://www. australianmeatsafety. com/newsupdates. html). To assist the livestock industries in complying with these regulations, a method for rapid detection of E. coli O157: H7, without culture-based pre-enrichment of carcass samples, was developed. A number of innovative PCR-based strategies to detect E. coli O157: H7 have been developed previously. All these methods detect genomic DNA, and PCR analysis will be positive, even if there are only dead or viable-but-non-culturable (VNBC) cells present (Botero et al. 2005). This might lead to an overestimation of the numbers of the pathogen present or false-positive results. In order to detect viable bacterial cells, McIngvale et al.(2002) and Yaron and Matthews (2002) developed reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays with a detection limit of 106-107 CFU/mL. These methods are based on the reverse-transcription of mRNA into cDNA, which then serves as a template for the PCR reaction, thus detecting actively growing cells. However, commonly used RNA extraction procedures are limited in their ability to effectively yield RNA from cell numbers lower than 106-107 CFU/mL.
