Conventional PCR assays detect PCR products at the end stage of each PCR reaction, where exponential ampli\ufb01cation is no longer being achieved. This approach can result in different end product (amplicon) quantities being generated [3]. In contrast, using quantitative, or real-time PCR, quanti\ufb01cation of the amplicon is performed not at the end of the reaction, but rather during exponential ampli\ufb01cation, where theoretically each cycle will result in a doubling of product being created ww [13]. For real-time PCR, the cycle at which \ufb02uorescence is deemed to be detectable above the background during the exponential phase is termed the cycle threshold (Ct). The Ctvalues obtained are then used for quantitation, which will be discussed later.Quantitative PCR allows the researcher to view the entire reaction and product beinggeneratedthroughoutallstagesofthereaction.

As the ampli\ufb01cation reaction proceeds and more double-stranded amplicons are produced, the SYBR Green dye \ufb02uorescence signal will increase and can be detected.
