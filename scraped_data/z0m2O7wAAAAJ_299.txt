While A. angustissima thrives in harsh environments and provides valuable nutrients required by ruminants, it has also been found to contain anti-nutritive factors that currently preclude its widespread application. A number of non-protein amino acids have been identified in the leaves of A. angustissima and in the past these have been linked to toxicity in ruminants. The non-protein amino acid 4-n-acetyl-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (ADAB) had been determined to be the major non-protein amino acid in the leaves of A. angustissima. Thus, in this study, the aim was to identify micro-organisms from the rumen environment capable of degrading ADAB. Using an ADAB-containing plant extract, a mixed enrichment culture was obtained that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-3312-5_28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hEIpAjDC8JAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
