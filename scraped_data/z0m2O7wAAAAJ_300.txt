Test animals were orally inoculated with 50 ml each of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains OB156, OB291, OR85, 0/10, S2/10, 149/33, and 10/1, all carrying recombinant plasmid pBHf. The fluoroacetate dehalogenase gene carried on this plasmid enables the bacteria to detoxify fluoroacetate. Rumen samples were collected on days 7, 12, and 15 after inoculation, to confirm by Polymerase Chain Reaction the presence of bacteria carrying the dehalogenase gene.All animals were challenged with sodium monofluoroacetate (3 equal doses at 0, 3, and 6 h, totalling 0.33 mg/kg body weight: calculated as 1.1\u00d7 LD50) on day 19 and monitored continuously for 24 h. Water was provided ad libitum and feed was provided at approximately 14 h."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mla.com.au/contentassets/4e8b78bbce5b456f8f37dc90b9716948/nbp.326_final_report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uHZ6xQpT4FUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
