Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) virulence factors [shiga toxin genes, stx1 and stx2; accessory virulence factors, intimin (eaeA) and plasmid-encoded enterohemolysin (hlyA)] in cattle faeces were also investigated. Objective-To determine firstly, whether roughage and/or molasses based diets reduce the population of E. coli and EHEC virulence factors compared with grain based feedlot diets, and secondly, if commercial lairage management practices promote or diminish these responses.Design-Thirty Brahman cross steers (mean LW\u00b1sem) 329\u00b13.2 kg, were initially fed a high grain (80%) diet. The cattle were then allocated into 3 groups of 10 animals and fed ad libitum (a) 50% molasses, 28% Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay, 15.0% whole cotton seed, 4.5% cotton seed meal, 1.5% urea and 1% mineral/vitamin premix (M+ R);(b) 80% sorghum, 5% peanut shells, 5.5% cotton seed meal (G); and (c) Rhodes grass plus 20g urea/kg DM (R). A fresh faecal sample (100g) was collected from each animal on the baseline grain diet, on 2 separate days during the final week of each dietary treatment (PL), and just prior to slaughter at lairage (L). A multiplex PCR method was used to quantify the virulence genes stx1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher-Mcsweeney/publication/237789961_Effect_of_diet_on_E_coli_populations_in_the_faeces_of_cattle/links/53d5c6d10cf228d363ea10e9/Effect-of-diet-on-E-coli-populations-in-the-faeces-of-cattle.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
