Streptococcus bovis type 2B, S. caprinus type strain 2.2 and Selenomonas ruminantium K2 were obtained and used for this study. Crude extracts of acacia condensed tannins (ACT), from Acacia aneura leaves, and tannic acid (TA) were used as tannin solutions. Streptococcus caprinus grew in up to 7.0% w/v TA, whereas S. bovis growth was inhibited by TA or ACT concentrations greater than 0.5% w/v. Increased activity of gallate decarboxylase and the accumulation of pyrogallol, as a result of S. caprinus exposure to TA (but not ACT) were observed. Selenomonas ruminantium K2 was able to grow on either TA (5% w/v) or ACT as a sole carbon source, and was shown to produce gallic acid from tannic acid."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9780851996141.0181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4zKNRAGIrFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
