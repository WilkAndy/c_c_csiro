E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0.05) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0.05) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80% of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15094231531079801916&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
