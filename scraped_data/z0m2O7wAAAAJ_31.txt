In this study, rats were fed Western-type diets moderate in fat (19%) and protein (20%) containing digestible starches [low amylose maize starch (LAMS) or low amylose whole wheat (LAW)] or RS [HAMS, HAMSB, or a whole high amylose wheat (HAW) generated by RNA interference] for 11 wk (n = 10/group). A control diet included 7% fat, 13% protein, and LAMS. Colonocyte DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) were significantly higher (by 70%) in rats fed the Western diet containing LAMS relative to controls. Dietary HAW, HAMS, and HAMSB opposed this effect while raising digesta levels of SCFA and lowering ammonia and phenol levels. SSB correlated inversely with total large bowel SCFA, including colonic butyrate concentration (R2 = 0.40; P = 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12332903612431166064", "cites_id": ["12332903612431166064"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/142/5/832/4630761", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cGoXNH5GJ6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 15, "2014": 14, "2015": 17, "2016": 14, "2017": 14, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
