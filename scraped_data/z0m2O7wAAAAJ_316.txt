Also, all basic evolution in terms of biochemistry and types of energy metabolism must have occurred earlier than 3.5 billion years ago during periods for which we have no direct evidence. Early evolution took place on earth in which most habitats (the atmosphere and oceans) were anaerobic. Thus, bacteria are nearly as old as the planet earth and events such as the oxygen forming atmosphere and even the age of dinosaurs are comparatively recent (Woese, 1994). Also, anaerobic habitats have existed continuously throughout the history of the earth, the gastrointestinal tract being a contemporary microniche (Fenchel and Finlay, 1995). The most obvious impact of fermentation in the modern world is on human and animal nutrition. The annual cellular production of prokaryotes based on population size (4.3\u00d7 1024 cells) and turnover (once daily) in the gut of domestic animals is 2\u00d7 1027, which is 2% of that in soil and only 0.1% of that in the oceans (Whitman et al., 1998).All animals, including humans, are adapted to life in a microbial world. The complexity of animal-microbe relationships varies tremendously, ranging from competition to cooperation (Hungate, 1976, 1984). The animal alimentary tract has evolved as an adaptation enabling the animal to secure food and limit consumption by other animals. This allows the retention and digestion of ingested food, followed by absorption and metabolism of digestion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_cxUuEaITRsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA61&dq=info:V8hZrA3cNscJ:scholar.google.com&ots=D_6eq6mwMS&sig=tHPmTCOIEqTpoh59-cB9AOT95S0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V8hZrA3cNscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
