Seventeen strains of presumptively identified Ruminococcus were evaluated by a combination of nearly complete and partial 16S rDNA sequence that identified all strains as either Ruminococcus albus or Ruminococcus flavefaciens. All sequences fell into cluster IV of the clostridia, while other species of ruminococci (eg. Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus lactaris) fall into cluster XIVa of the clostridia. Ruminococcus cluster IV sequences were used to design a 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probe to assess the relative abundance of target populations in a stable ruminal environment. A stable population (animals fed eight times per day) was established in sheep so that statistically robust comparisons could be made in the absence of variation due to diurnal rumen fluctuations. The steady state populations were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4695061390463978936&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
