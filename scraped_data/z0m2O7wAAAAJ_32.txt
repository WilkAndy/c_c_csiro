All sheep were defaunated by administration of sodium lauryl sulfate. After two weeks, half of the defaunated sheep were refaunated by inoculation with faunate rumen fluid. Both defaunated (DfN) and refaunated (RfN) sheep were divided into two groups, and assigned to treatments in a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement without (RfN, DfN) or with TS (3g/d) (RfTs, DfTs). After a feeding period of 3wk, CH4 production of individual sheep was measured using open circuit respiratory chambers and rumen fluid was sampled for analysis of rumen fermentation products and extraction of microbial DNA. Numbers of gene copies associated with rumen methanogens (mcrA gene), specific bacteria (16S rDNA gene) and rumen protozoa and fungi (18S rDNA gene) were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14532685797252944721", "cites_id": ["14532685797252944721"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037784011100126X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UVOgMbx4rskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
