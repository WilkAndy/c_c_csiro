The media were gassed with CO2, and 10-ml aliquots were dispensed into 25-ml Balch tubes (18 by 250 mm), which were stoppered and autoclaved for 15 min at 100 kPa. B vitamins (28) were added to each tube of medium just prior to inoculation, and incubations were at 39 C.Isolation procedures. Rumen digesta (100 g) was taken from four sheep and four goats (2-year-old male castrates, rumen fistulated) held in metabolism crates and fed a 100% fresh-calliandra diet (3.6% N) ad libitum. Calliandra fed to animals included leaf and stem material from young regrowth material, which was cut from trees and offered to the animals within an hour of harvest. The animals were sampled 18 h after feed was offered, and digesta was transferred immediately to an anaerobic chamber containing a gas phase of CO2-H2 (95: 5). A 5-g subsample was diluted (1: 10) with cold anaerobic diluent (29), homogenized for 1 min (Bamix, Mettlen, Switzerland), and serially diluted in diluent to a 10 9 dilution. Tannin overlay agar plates were prepared in an anaerobic chamber as follows (i) a 2% calliandra condensed tannin extract or tannic acid (Ajax Chemicals, Sydney, Australia) which was filter sterilized (22-m pore size) was poured onto brain heart infusion (BHI) medium or rumen habitat-simulating (RHS) medium (30) agar plates (Table 1),(ii) the tannin solution was allowed to precipitate with protein on the plate surface for 20 min,(iii) the tannin solution was then aspirated off, and (iv) the plate was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/35488536/3075.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l6XX2po23_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
