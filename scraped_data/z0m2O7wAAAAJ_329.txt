Consistent with previous studies, the profiles revealed a marked inter-subject variability; however, the numerical ecology methods of analysis allowed the subtraction of the subject effect from the data and revealed, for the first time, evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes along the colorectum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10726985479860041494&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
