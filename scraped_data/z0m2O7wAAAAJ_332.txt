This was a significant achievement because (1) the bacterium was the first isolated representative of the phylum Synergistetes which was previously undescribed,(2) a paradigm shift occurred which recognised that discrete functional groups of gut microorganisms could be geographically segregated rather than broadly dispersed, and (3) the bacterium was introduced onto the Australian continent where it was postulated that the organism did not exist, and thus would protect cattle from leucaena toxicity. However the \u2018leucaena story\u2019may not be as originally proposed based on our recent molecular ecology studies. In our taxonomic studies, we have found 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the species S. jonesii, recovered from both Australian cattle and wild indigenous herbivores in northern Australia, that differ from the S. jonesii type strain 78-1 which was released 20 years ago into Australian cattle. Recently we have also isolated from the bovine rumen a bacterium (strain MFA1) which belongs to the phylum Synergistetes and metabolizes fluoroacetate under anaerobic conditions (Davis et al., 2012). It is clear that our understanding of the Synergistetes phylum in the ruminant animals is rudimentary but potentially important in nutritional physiology. The objective of the paper is to examine the distribution, function and ecology of rumen Synergistetes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Purnomo-4/publication/233860189_Physico-Chemical_and_Organoleptic_Quality_ofMadurese_Spicy_Dried_Beef_Prepared_with_DifferentConcentrations_of_Cooking_Salt_and_Cane_Sugar/links/02e7e530eb1603f0ff000000/Physico-Chemical-and-Organoleptic-Quality-of-Madurese-Spicy-Dried-Beef-Prepared-with-Different-Concentrations-of-Cooking-Salt-and-Cane-Sugar.pdf#page=137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xrDfxdn406EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
