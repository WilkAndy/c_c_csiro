Dynamics of rumen microbial population were investigated in one of the trials.Tea seed saponins trials. In October-December of 2012, six Brahman (244\u00b120.4 kg LW) steers fed a mixed basal diet (BD) of 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay plus a Coleman Stock high-grain feed (0.85) were used to assess between October and December 2012, the effects of 23 days in total of sequential treatment with increasing levels of TSS supplementation (ie 6, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 g/d) on DMI; rumen fermentation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13693228793568302478&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jhXKtAkfCL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
