The selectivity of the membranes was investigated for the separation of H2 from CH4 gas species. Membranes with MWCNT concentrations of 1% increased the selectivity to H2 gas by 94.8%. Furthermore, CH4 permeation was almost totally blocked through membranes with MWCNT concentrations greater than 5%. Vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques revealed that upon the incorporation of MWCNT a decrease in the number of available Si\u2013CH3 and Si\u2013O bonds as well as an increase in the formation of Si\u2013C bonds occurred that initiated the reduction in CH4 permeation. As a result, the developed membranes can be an efficient and low cost solution for separating H2 from larger gas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3282958483294238089", "cites_id": ["3282958483294238089"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319913013943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ibUbwVhpjy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 15, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 9}}
