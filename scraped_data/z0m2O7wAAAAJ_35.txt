Functional gene-based analysis is the ideal approach for investigating organisms capable of this metabolism (acetogens). However, existing tools targeting the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene (fhs) are compromised by lack of specificity due to the involvement of formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) in other pathways. Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) is unique to the acetyl-CoA pathway and, in the present study, acetyl-CoA synthase genes (acsB) were recovered from a range of acetogens to facilitate the design of acsB-specific PCR primers. fhs and acsB libraries were used to examine acetogen diversity in the bovine rumen and forestomach of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), a native Australian marsupial demonstrating foregut fermentation analogous to rumen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2614480841568701399", "cites_id": ["2614480841568701399"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/AEM.01679-10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:10vEKXmASCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 9, "2013": 11, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
