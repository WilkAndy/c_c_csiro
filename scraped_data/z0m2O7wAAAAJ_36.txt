For nine species ADL and ADDL as percentage of original dry matter were, respectively: Aristides calcyna. 8.9 and 9.8; Astrebla squarrosa, 8.6 and 14.7; Chloris gayana, 3.9 and 6.7; Eragrostis sp, 4.3 and 8.8; Heteropogon eontorius, 3.9 and 10.4; Iseilema membranaceum 7.2 and 8.2; Panicum maximum, 1.8 and 5.7; Themeda triandra, 7.3 and 8.2; Sorghum sp, 3.4 and 13.8. Tropical legumes (four species) had much lower levels of ADDL. Azo\u2010stained fibre showed that most of the free phenolic functions and the alkali\u2010soluble lignin were in the ADDL fraction. The difference between grasses and legumes was so marked that azo\u2010staining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13577257168657550982", "cites_id": ["13577257168657550982"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2740650108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ho71oXUbbLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 6, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 10, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
