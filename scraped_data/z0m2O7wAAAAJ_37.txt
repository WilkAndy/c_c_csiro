Their effects on the data sets' characteristics and normalization efficiencies, as measured by several \u03b2-diversity metrics, were compared. For both data sets, subsampling to the median rather than the minimum number appeared to improve the analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7346044844027319686", "cites_id": ["7346044844027319686"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.05491-11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hpVWWN1k8mUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 19, "2018": 12, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
