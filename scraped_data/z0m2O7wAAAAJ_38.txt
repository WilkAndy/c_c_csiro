Although selective antimicrobials might increase CLA production by manipulation of ruminal microflora, feeding of antibiotic growth promoters to livestock is declining due to fears of development of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. This has initiated a search for alternatives, including plants containing bioactive compounds, which can have similar positive effects on ruminal microflora, but without negative impact on animal and human health. In this study we investigated effects of natural compounds in Australian plants on the bacteria and processes involved in ruminal biohydrogenation. Ethanolic extracts and essential oils were obtained from 91 Australian plants collected during 2004/2005 in Western Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3611224440624863852", "cites_id": ["3611224440624863852"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840107002829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bFqn436lHTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 15, "2015": 5, "2016": 13, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
