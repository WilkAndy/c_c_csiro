Microbial ecology methods identified species that exhibited positive and negative responses to the increasing levels of BCM. The methane-inhibited rumen appeared to adapt to the higher H2 levels by shifting fermentation to propionate which was mediated by an increase in the population of H2-consuming Prevotella and Selenomonas spp. Metagenomic analysis of propionate production pathways was dominated by genomic content from these species. Reductive acetogenic marker gene libraries and metagenomics analysis indicate that reductive acetogenic species do not play a major role in the BCM treated rumen."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17136927001249762668", "cites_id": ["17136927001249762668"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01087/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bM1K80-Y0u0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 19, "2018": 18, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 20, "2022": 23, "2023": 4}}
