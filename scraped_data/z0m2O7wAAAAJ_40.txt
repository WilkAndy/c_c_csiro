Methane is formed in the rumen by methanogens (part of the domain Archaea), mainly from H2 and CO2. Methanogens from a wide range of habitats are being genome-sequenced to gain a better understanding of their biology and, in particular, to identify targets for inhibition technologies for gut-associated methanogens. Genome comparisons are identifying common genes that define a methanogen, while gene differences are providing an insight into adaptations that allow methanogen survival and persistence under different environmental conditions. Within the rumen microbial food web, methanogens perform the beneficial task of removing H2, which allows reduced cofactors to be reoxidised and recycled, thereby enhancing the breakdown and fermentation of plant material.
