Different formulations of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) with these compounds were also tested for synergistic interaction against all organisms. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the use of disc diffusion and broth dilution assays. All EOs tested were found to have strong antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter spp. with inhibitory concentrations in the range 0.001\u20131% (v/v). Among the single compounds, terpinen-4-ol showed the highest activity against Campylobacter spp. and other reference strains \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8758565028114645079", "cites_id": ["8758565028114645079"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160513003887", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V8Du-nysjHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 13, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
