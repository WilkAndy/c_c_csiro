Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was also added to some in vitro fermentations (10mg PEG/50mg plant substrate) to assess the effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and nitrogen (N). Total tannin content was poorly correlated with digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen. Apparent digestibility of dry matter and N were significantly different between plants and ranked in the following order; lucerne>L. leucocephala>L. diversifolia>L. pallida>C. calothyrsus. Ammonia was not produced (net accumulation) during 72h fermentation of C. calothyrsus, L. diversifolia and L. pallida although apparent nitrogen digestion in these plants ranged from 36.9 to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15011909591878022182", "cites_id": ["15011909591878022182"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840199001030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JjQrwDwEVdAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 9, "2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
