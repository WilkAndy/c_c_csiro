Consistent with previous studies, the profiles revealed a marked intersubject variability; however, the numerical ecology methods of analysis allowed the subtraction of the subject effect from the data and revealed, for the first time, evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes along the colorectum. In particular, probes targeting Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. produced strongest signals with caecal and transverse colon samples, with a gradual decline through to the rectum. Conversely, the analyses suggest that several members of the Enterobacteriaceae increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3221526253772565843", "cites_id": ["3221526253772565843"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2010177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U221Ng8ptSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
