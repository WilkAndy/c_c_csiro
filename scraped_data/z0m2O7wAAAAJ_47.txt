Recent work suggests that leucaena mitigates ruminant enteric methane emissions, implying that the shrub may also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the whole farm level. However, the high crude protein content of leucaena relative to endemic grasses can increase livestock urine nitrogen concentration and may increase soil nitrous oxide emissions, potentially offsetting benefits of enteric methane mitigation.Here we examine the effects of leucaena on emissions, production and profitability at the whole farm level by modelling a property in northern Australia, assuming enterprises that specialise in cattle breeding and finishing.
