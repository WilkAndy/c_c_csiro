Conventional PCR assays detect PCR products at the end stage of each PCR reaction, where exponential amplification is no longer being achieved. This approach can result in different end product (amplicon) quantities being generated [3]. In contrast, using quantitative, or real-time PCR, quantification of the amplicon is performed not at the end of the reaction, but rather during exponential amplification, where theoretically each cycle will result in a doubling of product being created w [13]. For real-time PCR, the cycle at which fluorescence is deemed to be detectable above the background during the exponential phase is termed the cycle threshold (Ct). The Ct values obtained are then used for quantitation, which will be discussed later.Quantitative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14077980855627512695", "cites_id": ["14077980855627512695"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/1-4020-3791-0_8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d3tt9v8IX8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
