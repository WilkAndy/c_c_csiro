Rumen fermentation is unique in that efficient plant cell wall degradation relies on the cooperation between microorganisms that produce fibrolytic enzymes and the host animal that provides an anaerobic fermentation chamber. Increasing the efficiency with which the rumen microbiota degrades fiber has been the subject of extensive research for at least the last 100 years. Fiber digestion in the rumen is not optimal, as is supported by the fact that fiber recovered from feces is fermentable. This view is confirmed by the knowledge that mechanical and chemical pretreatments improve fiber degradation, as well as more recent research, which has demonstrated increased fiber digestion by rumen microorganisms when plant lignin composition is modified by genetic manipulation.
