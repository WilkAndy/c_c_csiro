The operational efficiencies of these membranes rely heavily on high gas permeability. Here, we report membranes with significantly increased permeability without a considerable decrease in mechanical strength or selectivity, synthesized from a polymer nanocomposite that incorporates graphene and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). These graphene\u2013PDMS nanocomposite membranes were able to enhance the gas permeation of N2, CO2, Ar, and CH4 in reference to pristine PDMS membranes. This is achieved by creating interfacial voids between the graphene flakes and polymer chains, which increases the fractional free volume within the nanocomposites, giving rise to an increase in permeation. An optimal loading of graphene was found to be 0.25 wt%, while greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18316387046028157901", "cites_id": ["18316387046028157901"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b02995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zSMTV_ngMP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 15, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
