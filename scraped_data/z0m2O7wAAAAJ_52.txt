The fungus did not degrade or transform model lignin compounds that were representative of the predominant intermonomer linkages in lignin, nor did it solubilize acid detergent lignin that had been isolated from spear grass. In a stem fraction of sorghum, 33.6% of lignin was apparently solubilized by the fungus. Solubilization of ester- and either-linked phenolics accounted for 9.2% of the lignin released. The amounts of free phenolic acids detected in culture fluid were equivalent to the apparent loss of ester-linked phenolics from the sorghum substrate. However, the fungus was unable to cleave the ether bond in hydroxycinnamic acid bridges that cross-link lignin and polysaccharide. It is suggested that the majority of the solubilized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2363896609369006520", "cites_id": ["2363896609369006520"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.60.8.2985-2989.1994", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uKEwF3E_ziAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
