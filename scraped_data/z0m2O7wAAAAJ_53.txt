Eight rumen-fistulated steers were fed a roughage hay diet (Rhodes grass; Chloris gayana) for 31 days (control period). Four animals received the antimethanogenic compound chloroform (1.6 g chloroform\u2013cyclodextrin/100 kg live weight (LW)) while the other four received 3-NOP (2.5 g 3-NOP/animal/day) for 21 days. Methane decrease compared with control period was similar for both treatments (30\u201338%) with no differences for expelled H2 between controls and treatments. Daily weight gain (DWG) was significantly increased when animals were treated with 3-NOP compared with chloroform and control. Regarding the ruminal fermentation parameters increases in ammonia, acetate and branched chain fatty acids were observed with both compounds compared with the controls. Also, methylamines, alcohols and dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) concentrations were significantly increased with the treatments compared with control, being greater with 3-NOP. The rumen microbial analyses revealed a similar profile for both treatments, with a shift in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to the Prevotellaceae and Campylobacteraceae family. Moreover, major archaeal OTUs associated with Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera were significantly affected to varying extents based on the inhibitory treatments compared to the control. The abundance of the Methanobrevibacter spp. was decreased by 3-NOP and chloroform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5060626978240951637", "cites_id": ["5060626978240951637"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01582/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VXXPomz1OkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 20, "2021": 26, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
