At low levels of tannin, S. bovis JB1 exhibited some tolerance but this was always less than for S. gallolyticus 2.2. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) has been hypothesised to be produced by S. gallolyticus in response to tannins and may form a protective layer around the cells. The study found that there was a significant increase in cellular polysaccharides and EPS gene expression in response to TA, AT, and CT in S. gallolyticus 2.2 but not S. bovis JB1. To examine the response in vivo, sheep were fed either Acacia angustissima, or Calliandra callothyrsus and the abundance of S. bovis and S. gallolyticus populations was measured using 16S-rRNA based oligonucleotide probes that differentiated these two populations.
