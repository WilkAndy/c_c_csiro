Five Brahman steers [mean live weight (LW); 226 kg] were allocated to one of five groups: control (no additive), CRINA1 (CRINA 1 g/d), CRINA2 (CRINA 2 g/d), Mon1 (monensin 60 mg/d) and Mon2 (monensin 250 mg/d) as a 5 \u00d7 5 Latin square. Individual LW, dry matter (DM, kg/d) intake, rumen pH, fermentation patterns, and ruminal fungal colonisation was measured. Methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) clone libraries (methanogen diversity) were generated from microbial DNA extracted from the rumen. Total methane production (g/d) was measured over 24 h using open circuit respiration chambers. The DM intake for animals given CRINA at either dose rate was not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17761532379305700073", "cites_id": ["17761532379305700073"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840114003988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6WodJ5ijffYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
