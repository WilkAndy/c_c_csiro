Bromochloromethane reduced total methane emissions by c. 30%, with a resultant increase in propionate and branched chain fatty acids. The mcrA clone libraries revealed that Methanobrevibacter spp. were the dominant species identified. A decrease in the incidence of Methanobrevibacter spp. from the clone library generated from bromochloromethane treatment was observed. In addition, a more diverse methanogenic population with representatives from Methanococcales, Methanomicrobiales and Methanosacinales orders was observed for the bromochloromethane library. Sequence data generated from these libraries aided in the design of an mcrA-targeted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 543, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8506913139552912067", "cites_id": ["8506913139552912067"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/62/3/313/542769", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w4Inym2gDnYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 21, "2010": 23, "2011": 29, "2012": 33, "2013": 40, "2014": 38, "2015": 54, "2016": 67, "2017": 45, "2018": 52, "2019": 40, "2020": 24, "2021": 26, "2022": 30, "2023": 13}}
