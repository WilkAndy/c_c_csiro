We combined molecular analysis with enrichment culture techniques to investigate this diversity further. Methane-inhibited, hydrogenotrophic enrichment cultures produced acetate as the dominant end product. Acetyl-CoA synthase gene analysis revealed putative acetogens in the cultures affiliated with the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae as has been found in other rumen studies. No formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase genes affiliating with acetogens or with \u2018homoacetogen similarity\u2019 scores >90% were identified. To further investigate the hydrogenotrophic populations in these cultures and link functional gene information with 16S rRNA gene identity, cultures were subcultured quickly, twice, through medium without exogenous hydrogen, followed by incubation without \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4496907415718300762", "cites_id": ["4496907415718300762"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/362/14/fnv104/739704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Woy1DXg5aD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
