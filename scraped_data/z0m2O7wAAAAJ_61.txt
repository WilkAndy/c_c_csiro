Methanogens belonging to the Methanobacteriales and a well-supported cluster of uncultivated archaeon sequences previously observed in the ovine and bovine rumens were found. Methanogen densities ranged from 7.0 \u00d7 105 and 3.9 \u00d7 106 cells per gram of wet weight."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16677785407531159145", "cites_id": ["16677785407531159145"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.02436-08", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aY4WKHdlc-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 10, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
