Here, we report on the isolation of a bovine rumen bacterium that metabolizes fluoroacetate under anaerobic conditions, the mode of degradation and its presence in gut ecosystems. The bacterium was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis as belonging to the phylum Synergistetes and was designated strain MFA1. Growth was stimulated by amino acids with greater quantities of amino acids metabolized in the presence of fluoroacetate, but sugars were not fermented. Acetate, formate, propionate, isobutryate, isovalerate, ornithine and H2 were end products of amino acid metabolism. Acetate was the primary end product of fluoroacetate dehalogenation, and the amount produced correlated with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14236046933826555183", "cites_id": ["14236046933826555183"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/80/3/671/444225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L02FsEKZkMUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
