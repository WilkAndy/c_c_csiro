In vitro gas and ammonia production and loss of neutral detergent fibre were estimated as indices for fermentation. The effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on fermentation was tested. The ability of microorganisms in rumen fluid sources to grow in the presence of tannin extracts or tannic acid was also tested and their disappearance was determined by HPLC. There was a significant (P < 0.001) rumen fluid source \u00d7 fodder type interaction with all variables studied. The highest gas and ammonia production was from samples incubated with rumen fluid from dik-dik and goat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11143765782815817595", "cites_id": ["11143765782815817595"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar98117", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e7_j8O-bppoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
