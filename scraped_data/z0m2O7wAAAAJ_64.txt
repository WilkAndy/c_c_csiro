Two probes were tested, and both were highly specific for the respective complementary sequences of the target organism. Individual cells of S. jonesii in pure and mixed cultures were clearly visualized in situ by hybridization with the fluorescent-dye-conjugated probe but could not be detected in natural samples. Therefore the radiolabelled probe was used to monitor the population of S. jonesii introduced into a chemostat which simulated the rumen ecosystem. The S. jonesii probe did not hybridize to RNA extracted from the culture prior to inoculation with the target organism. After inoculation, S. jonesii rRNA represented 4.5% of the total bacterial rRNA and then rapidly declined to < 0.2% before increasing to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15936480234482423289", "cites_id": ["15936480234482423289"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.59.5.1607-1612.1993", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-dVbklbAKd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 8, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
