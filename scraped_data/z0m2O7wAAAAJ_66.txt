However, the published protocols for DNA extraction typically used by gastroenterologists have not been systematically compared in terms of their recovery of the microbial fraction associated with colonic tissue. For this reason, we examined how three different tissue DNA extraction methods (the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA kit, salting out and high molecular weight (HMW) methods of DNA extraction) employed in past clinical trials, and the repeated bead beating and column (RBB+C) method might impact the recovery of microbial DNA from colonic tissue, using a custom designed phylogenetic microarray for gut bacteria and archaea. All four methods produced very similar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14839829394617626779", "cites_id": ["14839829394617626779"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-010-9771-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m3CVqTWq8c0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
