The chapter elaborates on these components: host-related factors, dietary factors, and the microbiota itself, which is comprised of bacteria, methanogens (Archaea), protozoa, fungi, and bacteriophages. The stability of the rumen ecosystem is discussed in terms of ruminal disorders; detoxification by rumen microbes, particularly ruminal adaptation to plant toxins and ruminal metabolism of toxins associated with fodder plants; manipulation of the rumen ecosystem; antimicrobial agents and microbial feed additives; and inoculants of natural and recombinant rumen microorganisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17070091980512100200", "cites_id": ["17070091980512100200"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9780851995953.0071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aP-qDTcm5ewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
