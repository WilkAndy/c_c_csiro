The affinity of these tannins and of the simple phenolic gallic acid for the two proteins casein and pepsin, polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP), activated charcoal and Ca(OH)2 was examined in vitro. The studies were undertaken to predict the effect of these phenolics on digestion and to identify substances that would act as antidotes by precipitating phenolics. Tannins but not gallic acid were precipitated as stable complexes with both pepsin and casein at pH 3\u20135. Optimal complexing of tannin with protein occurred at a weight ratio of 1:1. Ionic strength and temperature did not affect the amount of tannin precipitated from solution with protein. The precipitation of tannins with PVP and Ca(OH)2 was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10053796808423661907", "cites_id": ["10053796808423661907"], "pub_url": "https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jat.2550110506", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U2EMEu5ChosJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
