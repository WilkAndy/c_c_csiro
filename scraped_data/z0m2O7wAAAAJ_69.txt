Microbial populations in the maturing rumen undergo successional changes and, while in a state of flux, provide a possible opportunity for the introduction of specific strains of bacteria. While the rumen of the young lamb was maturing, we measured changes in several microbial populations with 16S-rRNA specific oligonucleotides: Rumincoccus, Fibrobacter, eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, the Bacteroides\u2013Porphromonas\u2013Prevotella group, and anaerobic rumen fungi. In this study we repeatedly dosed 15 lambs with approximately 3.4 \u00d7 108 to 0.8 \u00d7 109 Ruminococcus cells dose-1, twice a week, for 7 wk from 23 d to 63 d of age. Of the five Ruminococcus strains dosed (R. albus SY3 and AR67, and R. flavefaciens Y1, LP9155, and AR72) the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6068089290861000740", "cites_id": ["6068089290861000740"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002489901006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JDgfVw8vNlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
