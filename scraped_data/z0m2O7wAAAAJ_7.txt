Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 457, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8835166809877646924", "cites_id": ["8835166809877646924"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article-abstract/16/12/2034/4628216", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TA4UImfRnHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 18, "2012": 34, "2013": 32, "2014": 41, "2015": 34, "2016": 40, "2017": 38, "2018": 47, "2019": 30, "2020": 49, "2021": 41, "2022": 33, "2023": 14}}
