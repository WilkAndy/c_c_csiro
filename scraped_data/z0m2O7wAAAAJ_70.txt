Two different gel-based methods are described for separating populations of gut fungal rDNA amplicons, namely (1) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and (2) separation according to small size differences using Spreadex, a proprietary matrix for electrophoresis. Gut fungal populations were characterised by analysis of rDNA in faeces of seventeen domesticated and ten wild herbivores. Sequences derived from these gel-based characterisations were analysed and classified using a hidden Markov model-based fingerprint matching algorithm. Faecal samples contained a broad spectrum of fungi and sequences from five of the six recognised genera were identified, including Cyllamyces, the most recently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7494260872765817987", "cites_id": ["7494260872765817987"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075996409000833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g8RQt472AGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 3, "2022": 5}}
