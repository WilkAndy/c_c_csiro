For the purposes of this paper we define rumen biotechnology as the application of knowledge of forestomach fermentation and the use and management of both natural and recombinant rumen microorganisms to improve the efficiency of ruminant production. Knowledge of rumen digestion that is relevant to modifying both the nutritive value of feedstuffs and the rumen microbial ecosystem by biotechnology is reviewed. Examples of the use and potential of biotechnology to alter the amount and availability of carbohydrate and protein in plants as well as the rate and extent of fermentation and metabolism of these nutrients in the rumen are discussed. The potential applications of biotechnology to rumen microorganisms are manifold and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12208935161464441576", "cites_id": ["12208935161464441576"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301622699000329", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6Erd-NfZbqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
