We based our simulations on a case-study farm in central Queensland, Australia, and studied the influence of interventions designed for emissions mitigation, increasing productivity, or increasing gross margin. Interventions included replacing urea supplementation with nitrate, finishing cattle on the perennial forage leucaena (L), herd structure optimisation (HO), higher female fecundity (HF), and a leucaena finishing enterprise that had net farm emissions equal to the baseline (leucaena equal emissions; LEE). The HO intervention reduced the ratio of breeding cows relative to steers and unmated heifers, and lowered the ratio of costs to net cattle sales. Gross margin of the baseline, nitrate, L \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3924814025357404290", "cites_id": ["3924814025357404290"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/AN15515", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gijmvo-9dzYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 22, "2023": 7}}
