Each group contained a fistulated cow and groups were allocated to 1 of 3 feeding strategies: (1) control (10 groups): cows were fed crushed wheat grain twice daily in the milking parlor and ryegrass silage at pasture; (2) partial mixed ration (PMR; 10 groups): PMR that was isoenergetic to the control diet and fed twice daily on a feed pad; (3) PMR+canola (4 groups): a proportion of wheat in the PMR was replaced with canola meal to produce more estimated metabolizable protein than other groups. Supplements were fed to the control and PMR cows at 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 kg of DM/d, and to the PMR+canola cows at 14 or 16 kg of DM/d. The PMR-fed cows had a lower incidence of ruminal acidosis compared with controls, and ruminal acidosis increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2430012190285892964", "cites_id": ["2430012190285892964"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030214004718", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZA3cWTYjuSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
