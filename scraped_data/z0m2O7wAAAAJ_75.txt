Methods and Results:  Thirty Brahman\u2010cross steers were initially fed a high grain (80%) diet and then randomly allocated into three dietary treatment groups, fed 80% grain, roughage, or roughage + 50% molasses. Up to eight different E. coli isolates were selected from primary isolation plates of faecal samples from each animal. Fifty\u2010two distinct serotypes, including nine different VTEC strains, were identified from a total of 474 E. coli isolates. Cattle fed a roughage + molasses diet had greater serotype diversity (30 serotypes identified) than cattle fed roughage or grain (21 and 17 serotypes identified respectively). Cluster analysis showed that serotypes isolated from cattle fed roughage and roughage + molasses diets were more closely associated than serotypes isolated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4896577900562906467", "cites_id": ["4896577900562906467"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/98/3/699/6722365", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y30USqgj9EMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
