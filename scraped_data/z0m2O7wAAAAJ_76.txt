In order to determine the hepatotoxic potential of Indonesian plants, goats were intoxicated experimentally with the Indonesian plant Climedia hirta (harendong), which cuntained 19% hydrolysable tannin. The prophylactic effect of Ca(OH)2 supplementation on the disease was also examined. Two groups of goats were fed for 28 days with grain\u2010based pellets containing 50% harendong leaf or 50% harendong leaf + 8% Ca(OH)2. Two control groups were fed similar pellets containing 50% of the non\u2010toxic elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) with and without 8% Ca(OH)2. Serum enzymes indicative of liver damage were monitored during the experiment and histopathological examination of selected tissues was done at the conclusion of the experiment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3377049399546625417", "cites_id": ["3377049399546625417"], "pub_url": "https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jat.2550100504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iT3sWImw3S4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
