Methods and Results:  The effect of two reduced sulfur compounds, 3\u2010mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or 3\u2010mercapto\u20101\u2010propanesulfonic acid as the sole S source on growth of pure fibroyltic fungal and bacterial cultures showed that these compounds were capable of sustaining growth. An in vivo trial was then conducted to determine the effect of sulfur supplements (MPA and sodium sulfate) on microbial population dynamics in cattle fed the roughage Dichanthium aristatum. Real\u2010time PCR showed significant increases in fibrolytic bacterial and fungal populations when cattle were supplemented with these compounds.
