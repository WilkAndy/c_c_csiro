Holstein-Friesian heifers (n = 30) were randomly allocated to 5 triticale grain-based treatment groups: (1) control (no grain), (2) grain [fed at a dry matter intake (DMI) of 1.2% of body weight (BW)], (3) grain (0.8% of BW DMI) + fructose (0.4% of BW DMI), (4) grain (1.2% of BW DMI) + histidine (6 g/head), and (5) grain (0.8% of BW DMI) + fructose (0.4% of BW DMI) + histidine (6 g/head). Ruminal fluid was collected using a stomach tube 5, 115, and 215 min after consumption of the rations and bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequence data was analyzed to characterize bacteria. Large variation among heifers and distinct BCC were evident in a between-group constrained principal components \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1443021919135424502", "cites_id": ["1443021919135424502"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030214003889", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9l8rPcqkBhQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
