Understanding the functions carried out by the rumen microbiota is important for reducing greenhouse gas production by ruminants and for developing biofuels from lignocellulose. We present 410 cultured bacteria and archaea, together with their reference genomes, representing every cultivated rumen-associated archaeal and bacterial family. We evaluate polysaccharide degradation, short-chain fatty acid production and methanogenesis pathways, and assign specific taxa to functions. A total of 336 organisms were present in available rumen metagenomic data sets, and 134 were present in human gut microbiome data sets. Comparison with the human microbiome revealed rumen-specific enrichment for genes encoding de novo synthesis of vitamin B12, ongoing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 376, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18442354137615484899", "cites_id": ["18442354137615484899"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:48eGWmBn8P8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 20, "2019": 62, "2020": 84, "2021": 82, "2022": 95, "2023": 29}}
