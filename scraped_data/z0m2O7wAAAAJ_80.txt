Proximate analysis and in vitro techniques were used to evaluate the nutritive value of 15 accessions of A. angustissima in comparison with the tanniniferous legumes (Calliandra calothyrsus and Leucaena leucocephala) and lucerne (Medicago sativa). Freeze- and oven-dried (50\u00b0C) leaf samples were used and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added to some in vitro fermentations (5mg PEG/50mg plant substrate) to assess the effects of tannins on digestion of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N). The acacia accessions were also screened for secondary compounds that could effect the nutritive value of the plant. Average NDF and ADF content did not differ markedly between A. angustissima accessions (417 and 189g/kg), L. leucocephala (447 and 178g/kg), C. calothyrsus (416 and 205g/kg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16147267869165400416", "cites_id": ["16147267869165400416"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840105000702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YLGuOpOeFuAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
