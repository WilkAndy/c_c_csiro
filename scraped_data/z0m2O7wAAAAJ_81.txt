Methods and Results:  The method could discriminate between three genera of anaerobic rumen fungal isolates, representing Orpinomyces, Piromyces and Neocallimastix species. Changes in anaerobic fungal composition were observed between animals fed a high\u2010fibre diet compared with a grain\u2010based diet. ARISA analysis of rumen samples from animals on grain showed a decrease in fungal diversity with a dominance of Orpinomyces and Piromyces spp. Clustering analysis of ARISA profile patterns grouped animals based on diet. A single strain of Orpinomyces was dosed into a cow and was detectable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4122187379974608573", "cites_id": ["4122187379974608573"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/47/6/492/6700970", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vRb88JTzNDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 11, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
