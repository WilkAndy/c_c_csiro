In Expt 1, the straw was supplemented with 5% of leaf of Leucaena leucocephala, and in Expt 2 with either urea or urea with sunflower meal and rice grain. Intake of supplements of urea or urea/sunflower/rice respectively was 935 and 681 g/kg offered in buffaloes and 566 and 789 in cattle.Buffaloes ruminated longer than cattle (Expt 1, 635 v. 452 min/day; Expt 2, 626 v. 466 min/day, P < 0\u00b701). In Expt 1, voluntary intake and frequency of \u2018A\u2019 sequence forestomach contractions of both species was not affected by species, but buffaloes had a greater (P < 0\u00b705) contraction force in the rumen and omasum, lower rate of \u2018B\u2019 sequence rumen contractions, and faster (P < 0\u00b7001) rate of gastrointestinal passage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11567694809639996824", "cites_id": ["11567694809639996824"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/intake-and-digestion-in-swamp-buffaloes-and-cattle-1-the-digestion-of-rice-straw-oryza-sativa/3B8209BE70B2D6F37C343B859A6EFEB0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mM24HiS1iKAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
