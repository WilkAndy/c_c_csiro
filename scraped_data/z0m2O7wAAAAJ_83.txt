The animals were adult goats, males, crossbred, with rumen fistula, fed with hay, and native pasture. The rumen fluid was obtained through the rumen fistula and immediately was inoculated 100\u2009\u03bcL in mineral medium added with 20\u2009mmol\u2009              L              \u2212     1            sodium fluoroacetate (SF), incubated at 39\u00b0C in an orbital shaker. Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain DSM 8341) was used as positive control for fluoroacetate dehalogenase activity. Two isolates were identified by 16S\u2009rRNA gene sequencing as Pigmentiphaga kullae (ECPB08) and Ancylobacter dichloromethanicus (ECPB09). These bacteria degraded sodium fluoroacetate, releasing 20\u2009mmol\u2009              L              \u2212     1            of fluoride ion after 32 hours of incubation in Brunner medium containing 20\u2009mmol\u2009              L              \u2212     1            of SF. There are no previous reports of fluoroacetate dehalogenase activity for P. kullae and A. dichloromethanicus. Control measures to prevent plant intoxication, including use of fences, herbicides, or other methods of eliminating poisonous plants, have been unsuccessful to avoid poisoning by fluoroacetate containing plants in Brazil. In this way, P. kullae and A. dichloromethanicus may be used to colonize the rumen of susceptible animals to avoid intoxication by fluoroacetate containing plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7034018476004332009", "cites_id": ["7034018476004332009"], "pub_url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/178254/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6dHFPYnanWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
