In rats, resistant starches (a dietary fibre component) oppose colonocyte DNA strand breaks induced by high red meat diets, consistent with epidemiological data. Protection appears to be through SCFA, particularly butyrate, produced by large bowel carbohydrate fermentation. Arabinoxylans are important wheat fibre components and stimulate large bowel carbohydrate SCFA production. The present study aimed to determine whether an arabinoxylan-rich fraction (AXRF) from wheat protected colonocytes from DNA damage and changed colonic microbial composition in pigs fed with a diet high (30 %) in cooked red meat for 4 weeks. AXRF was primarily fermented in the caecum, as indicated by higher tissue and digesta weights and higher caecal (but not colonic) acetate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16443414077136926587", "cites_id": ["16443414077136926587"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/an-arabinoxylanrich-fraction-from-wheat-enhances-caecal-fermentation-and-protects-colonocyte-dna-against-dietinduced-damage-in-pigs/C3525268B2C733CFE3F7FDB63ACB0883", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e3dncvu9MuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
