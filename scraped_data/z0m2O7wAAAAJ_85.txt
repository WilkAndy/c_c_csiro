The samples were cultivated in mineral medium added with 20\u2009mmol\u2009L\u22121 sodium fluoroacetate. Seven isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Paenibacillus sp. (ECPB01), Burkholderia sp. (ECPB02), Cupriavidus sp. (ECPB03), Staphylococcus sp. (ECPB04), Ancylobacter sp. (ECPB05), Ralstonia sp. (ECPB06), and Stenotrophomonas sp. (ECPB07). All seven isolates degraded sodium-fluoroacetate-containing in the medium, reaching defluorination rate of fluoride ion of 20\u2009mmol\u2009L\u22121. Six of them are reported for the first time as able to degrade sodium fluoroacetate (SF). In the future, some of these microorganisms can be used to establish in the rumen an engineered bacterial population able to degrade sodium fluoroacetate and protect ruminants from the poisoning by this compound."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6521221052642994846", "cites_id": ["6521221052642994846"], "pub_url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/149893/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nqqVGP8HgFoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
