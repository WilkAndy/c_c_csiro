The expectation was to use TSS to potentially modulate the rumen microbial population and decrease enteric methane (CH4) production. The steers were fed twice a day with a basal diet (BD) that contained a mixture of 0.15 Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay plus 0.85 of a commercial concentrate before CH4 emissions were measured in open-circuit respiratory chambers for 48 h. Steers were then adapted progressively to doses of 20 and 30 g/day of TSS for 10 and 6 days, respectively before new CH4 measurements were recorded. Final placement in chambers was conducted after 13 days of TSS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8969826287683849604", "cites_id": ["8969826287683849604"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840116300943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hE1bBnw5e3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
