E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0\u00b705) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0\u00b705) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80\u200a% of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17188997632061940302", "cites_id": ["17188997632061940302"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.25685-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TiIVcEaWi-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
