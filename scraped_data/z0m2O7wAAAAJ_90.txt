In this work, we developed a nanocomposite catalytic membrane made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with different weight concentrations of silver (Ag) nanoparticles to reactively remove H2S from CH4 and CO2 gas streams. PDMS was chosen as a model base polymer as Ag nanoparticles could be well dispersed into its matrix. At a small Ag nanoparticles loading of 1%, the catalytic membranes were able to remove more than 60% of H2S gas molecules. The characterization revealed that the exposure to H2S gas molecules transformed the Ag nanoparticles into a catalytic nanocompound made of Ag and Ag2S. The nanocompound then catalytically decomposed H2S, while it had much smaller effect on CO2 and almost no effect on CH4 gas species.
