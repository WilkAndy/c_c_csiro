Methods and Results:  The size of faecal E. coli populations and fermentation characteristics were ascertained in three experiments where cattle were maintained on a range of finishing diets including high grain, roughage, and roughage + molasses (50%) diets. Increased E. coli numbers, decreased pH and enhanced butyrate and lactate fermentation pathways were associated with grain diets, whereas roughage and roughage + molasses diets resulted in decreased concentrations of ehxA, eaeA and stx1 genes, this trend remaining at lairage. In one experiment, faecal E. coli numbers were significantly lower in animals fed roughage and roughage + molasses, than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6137027597547252724", "cites_id": ["6137027597547252724"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/99/4/885/6720538", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9KuSqBUaK1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
