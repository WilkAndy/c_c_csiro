This approach may be feasible if, for example, strains of Ruminococcus that are significantly more fibrolytic than the normal population of Ruminococcus are used for inoculation purposes. Introduced strains of bacteria, irrespective of ecosystem, often decline after inoculation, and in this study, highly fibrolytic strains of Ruminococcus were continuously dosed to ensure that measurements of fibre digestion were made in the presence of significant numbers of the introduced bacteria. During dosing the total culturable count increased significantly (P<0\u00b705), but declined post-dosing. The level of dosed Ruminococcus, and total Ruminococcus, Fibrobacter succinogenes and eukaryotes measured by 16S rRNA probes increased significantly (P<0\u00b705) during the dosing period, but also declined post-dosing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1602213259007911415", "cites_id": ["1602213259007911415"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-147-7-1719", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:92WWXXg0PBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
