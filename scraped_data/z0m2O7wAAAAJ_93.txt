This complex, mixed microbial culture is comprised of prokaryote organisms including methaneproducing archaebacteria, eukaryote organisms, such as ciliate and flagellate protozoa, anaerobic phycomycete fungi and bacteriophage. Bacteria are predominant (up to 1011 viable cells per g comprising 200 species) but a variety of ciliate protozoa occur widely (104\u2013106/g distributed over 25 genera). The anaerobic fungi are also widely distributed (zoospore population densities of 102\u2013104/g distributed over 5 genera). The occurrence of bacteriophage is well documented (107\u2013109 particles/g). This section focuses primarily on the widely used methods for the cultivation and the enumeration of rumen microbes, especially bacteria, which grow under anaerobic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5648432831043069280", "cites_id": ["5648432831043069280"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/1-4020-3791-0.pdf#page=31", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YOX5r7tDY04J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
