Bacterial analysis showed that genera affiliating with the Proteobacteria apparently made a greater metabolic contribution to rumen function than their population sizes indicated. Analysis of another rumen microbial group, the methanogens, using clone libraries for the expressed methyl coenzyme reductase subunit A (mcrA) revealed that an uncultivated methanogen clade contributes one\u2010third of RNA\u2010derived mcrA sequences based on a limited number of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "z0m2O7wAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7952522732526687321", "cites_id": ["7952522732526687321"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/115/3/644/6716612", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WdR4fEoJXW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
