A model of total N and 15N accumulation by soybean and the 15N enrichment of plant-available soil N was used to estimate Patm independent of a non-fixing reference plant, and compared to estimates of Patm derived from the use of non-fixing soybean and ryegrass as reference plants.The decline in 15N enrichment of the plant-available soil N (asoil) was described by first-order kinetics of the form, asoil = b exp(\u2212Dt). Decline constants (D) for the atom% 15N excess of KCl-extractable NO3\u2212-N were 0.0571, 0.0225 and 0.0211 d\u2212 for soybean, non-fixing soybean and ryegrass, respectively, and were independent of fertilizer 15N abundance.
