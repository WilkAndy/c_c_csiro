Nitrogen was applied at 0 and 150 kg N ha\u22121 (treatments N0 and N150, respectively) and gypsum at 0 and 5 t ha\u22121. Nitrogen and gypsum treatments were applied at sowing.Yield increased from a mean of 4 t ha\u22121 treatment RF to 6.6 t ha\u22121 in treatments IF and IW, largely because of promotive effects of irrigation on kernel weight (increase from 31 mg to 42 mg kernel\u22121 and kernel spikelet\u22121 (1.4 as compared with 1.7). Seasonal conditions and the relative fertility of the site were sufficient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7326654102565688103", "cites_id": ["7326654102565688103"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429089900701", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JxOWhxaBrWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
