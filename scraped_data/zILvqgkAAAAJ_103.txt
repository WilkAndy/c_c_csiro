An average accretion rate of 0\u201055 cm yr\u22121 was found on Grande Terre, and 0.78 cm yr\u22121 on Grand Isle. Analysis of mineral organic content of the marsh profile shows that the backbarrier marshes accrete through (1) accumulation of low density organic matter, and (2) episodic deposition of high density mineral sediment probably associated with major hurricanes or storm events. The rates of vertical accretion were two to three times less than the rate of submergence due primarily to rapid subsidence in the deltaic plain, and imply that these backbarrier marshes will progressively deteriorate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=327384430934943615", "cites_id": ["327384430934943615"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.3290110503", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f-fexmcaiwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 7, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
