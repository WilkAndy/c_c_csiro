Condor) grown on a red-brown earth in the Goulburn Irrigation region were investigated. Irrigation treatments included a rainfed control, and irrigation on either a 14 or 7-day cycle beginning in the spring. Fertilizer N was applied to the soil at sowing at 150 kg N ha\u22121.The percentage recovery of 15N-labelled fertilizer in the biomass increased to a maximum of about 40% within 120 days after sowing (das 120) and then remained constant. Approximately 58 kg N ha\u22121 of fertilizer was recovered in the biomass. It was in the stem-plus-leaf component at das 100 and was later redistributed into the developing head. At maturity a maximum of 36% of the fertilizer was recovered in the head.Residual fertilizer in the soil, including roots, decreased with time. Sixteen to 20% of the applied N was recovered in the surface 0.10 m.
