On 25 March 2020, Intercollegiate guidelines were published in the UK to promote safe surgical provision during the COVID-19 outbreak advocating non-operative management or avoidance of laparoscopy when surgery is essential. The effects of this on the investigation and management of appendicitis remain unknown.We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study from the start of the new guidelines to the 6th of May 2020. We included all patients referred to surgical teams with suspected appendicitis. A recent historical cohort was identified for comparison. The primary outcome was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of non-operative management in appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included imaging, negative appendicectomy rate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:-z4IEurqN94C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1892113234502015090", "cites_id": ["1892113234502015090"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00423-020-02023-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cthOQfYiQhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 15, "2023": 7}}
