Treatments were rainfed (Rf) or watered at a deficit of 50 mm (40\u201360 mm, I50) beginning in the spring. N treatments were 0, 50, 100 or 200 kg N ha\u22121 at sowing or as split applications of 20/80, and 50/50 kg N ha\u22121 at sowing and rosette, respectively.Yield (Yg) ranged from 170 to 520 g m\u22122. Irrigation and N increased yield in both years. Grain yields were increased by N application on the irrigated treatments when 100 or 200 kg N ha\u22121 was applied. Oil concentrations ranged from a maximum of 46.4% in treatment N0 to a minimum of 40.6% in treatment N200 and was inversely related to seed N concentration. Although fertilizer N decreased oil concentration, it increased the yield of oil.Nitrogen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1056651600781014299", "cites_id": ["1056651600781014299"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01052393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G3XmUwj7qQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 11, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 14, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
