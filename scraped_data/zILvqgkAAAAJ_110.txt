The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis is an optimal combination of modelling and observations of atmospheric composition. It provides a unique opportunity to rely on observations to quantify the monthly and spatially resolved global distributions of radiative forcing consistently for six of the largest forcing agents: carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, stratospheric ozone, aerosol\u2013radiation interactions, and aerosol\u2013cloud interactions. These radiative-forcing estimates account for adjustments in stratospheric temperatures but do not account for rapid adjustments in the troposphere. On a global average and over the period 2003\u20132017, stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing of carbon dioxide has averaged +1.89 W m\u22122 (5 %\u201395 % confidence interval: 1.50 to 2.29 W m\u22122) relative to 1750 and increased at a rate of 18 % per decade. The corresponding values for methane are +0.46 (0.36 to 0.56) W m\u22122 and 4 % per decade but with a clear acceleration since 2007. Ozone radiative-forcing averages +0.32 (0 to 0.64) W m\u22122, almost entirely contributed by tropospheric ozone since stratospheric ozone radiative forcing is only +0.003 W m\u22122. Aerosol radiative-forcing averages \u22121.25 (\u22121.98 to \u22120.52) W m\u22122, with aerosol\u2013radiation interactions contributing \u22120.56 W m\u22122 and aerosol\u2013cloud interactions contributing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:IirLfZ2R_SQC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14073593501710878533", "cites_id": ["14073593501710878533"], "pub_url": "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1649/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RQe5hrlyT8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
