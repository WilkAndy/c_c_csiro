However, parameters are not always directly measurable. This study represents one of the first attempts to obtain hydrologic, transport and geochemical parameters from an experimental dataset involving transient unsaturated water flow and solute transport, using an automatic inverse optimization (or calibration) algorithm. The data come from previously published, controlled laboratory experiments on the transport of major cations (Na, K, Mg, Ca) during water absorption into horizontal soil columns that were terminated at different times. Experimental data consisted of the depth profiles of water contents (\u03b8), Cl concentrations, and total aqueous and sorbed concentrations of major cations. The dataset was used to optimize several parameters using the reactive transport model, HP1 and the generic optimization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15328974434030620822", "cites_id": ["15328974434030620822"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772212000514", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lpBwBwh1u9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
