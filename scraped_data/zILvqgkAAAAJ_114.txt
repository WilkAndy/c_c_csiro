[Stallard, T., Miller, S., Melin, H., Lystrup, M., Dougherty, M., Achilleos, N., 2007. Icarus 189, 1\u201313], with a view to understanding the magnetospheric processes with which they are connected. The data are not consistent with the theory that Saturn's main auroral oval is associated with corotation enforcement currents in the middle magnetosphere. This implies that the main auroral oval can be associated with the open\u2013closed field line boundary [Cowley, S.W.H., Bunce, E.J., O'Rourke, J.M., 2004. J. Geophys. Res. 109. A05212]; a third model, by Sittler et al. [Sittler, E.C., Blanc, M.F., Richardson, J.D., 2006. J. Geophys. Res. 111. A06208] associates the main oval with centrifugal instabilities in the outer magnetosphere, but does not make predictions about ionospheric plasma \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:MOzItdknnOoC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15609654041123391364", "cites_id": ["15609654041123391364"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103507002606", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hIfmm6WhoNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
