Nitrogen supply (fertiliser and mineralisation) was partitioned between crop uptake, gaseous and leaching losses, and residual mineral N in the soil profile. The study plots were 2 adjacent 5-ha areas. At stem elongation (Zadock\u2019s decimal code 31), one area was topdressed with urea at 14 g N/m2 (fertilised crop). The total N supply to the fertilised crop was 29 g N/m2\u20148 g N/m2 of mineral N in the soil at sowing, net mineralisation of 5.3 g N/m2, and fertiliser inputs of 1.7 and 14 g N/m2. The corresponding value for the non-fertilised crop was 15 g N/m2. The urea application produced a 50% increase in above-ground biomass (1521 and 1008 g/m2 dry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11227454154191203742", "cites_id": ["11227454154191203742"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR99138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nu2MUBHuz5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
