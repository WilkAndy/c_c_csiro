Dissolved methane content in interstitial water increased with increasing depth. Methane production rate was related to temperature in the 0\u201340 cm depth, but was relatively constant at depths below 40 cm. Maximal methane content was found in spring and lowest content in November to January. Production rates were pH dependent, with an optimum rate of methanogenesis at pH 7.7. The accumulation of metabolic end products produced within the peat-water matrix appear to be important in limiting methanogenesis in wetland ecosystems. The reserve of methane in the interstitial water of the brackish marsh was estimated to be 15.8 g CH4 m\u22122 or 221 CH4 per m\u22122. Results suggest that the vast peat deposits in the Mississippi deltaic plain could possibly be a potential source of renewable energy if in situ method for removal of the produced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=795442783155201689", "cites_id": ["795442783155201689"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0146638086900690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mSYdMf_6CQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
