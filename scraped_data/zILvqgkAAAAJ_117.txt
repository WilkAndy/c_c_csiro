A model of total N and 15N accumulation in lupins and decreasing 15N enrichment in the KCl-extractable soil-N pool (0\u20130.15 m depth) was used to estimate the proportion of N in lupins derived from biological N2 fixation. Estimates of N2 fixation derived from the model were compared with 15N isotope-dilution estimates obtained using canola, annual ryegrass, and wheat as nonfixing reference plants. Biomass, total N accumulation, or 15N enrichment in the lupin and reference crops did not differ whether NH                   inf4 sup+                 or NO                   inf3 sup-                 was added as the labelled inorganic-N source. The decrease in soil 15N enrichment was described by first-order kinetics, whereas total N and 15N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17504489700901664100", "cites_id": ["17504489700901664100"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00340582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZDW65KNw7PIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
