The primary aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, experience and psychological implications of unintended conscious awareness during general anaesthesia in obstetric patients. From May 2017 to August 2018, 3115 consenting patients receiving general anaesthesia for obstetric surgery in 72 hospitals in England were recruited to the study. Patients received three repetitions of standardised questioning over 30 days, with responses indicating memories during general anaesthesia that were verified using interviews and record interrogation. A total of 12 patients had certain/probable or possible awareness, an incidence of 1 in 256 (95%CI 149\u2013500) for all obstetric surgery. The incidence was 1 in 212 (95%CI 122\u2013417) for caesarean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:pHoEe-iXohYC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9272015514315742", "cites_id": ["9272015514315742"], "pub_url": "https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anae.15385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3isVV9nwIAAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
