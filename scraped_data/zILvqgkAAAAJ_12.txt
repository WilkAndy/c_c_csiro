Marnoo) to two irrigation treatments and six nitrogen fertilizer treatments. Dry matter accumulation, leaf area development and seed yield were measured. The dry matter and seed yield response to applied nitrogen was greater under irrigated compared to rainfed conditions. Maximum seed yield (approx. 3.8 t ha\u22121) was obtained from the irrigated treatment receiving 100 kg N ha\u22121 applied at sowing. This high rate of N application at sowing led to more rapid leaf area development and higher maximum LAI compared to treatments supplied with split application of the same amount of N at sowing and rosette stages. Greater partitioning of dry matter into the leaf component and higher specific leaf areas under the higher N regime were largely responsible for this increase. Higher maximum LAI's were associated with greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:grZTYWtF7b0C", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15459150842953224444", "cites_id": ["15459150842953224444"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00292139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_FBoG8nvidYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
