The techniques were based on inhibition of either ammonium or nitrite oxidation and 13N isotope dilution. Of four inhibitors of ammonium oxidation evaluated, one (allylthiourea) was ineffective and two (2-ethynylpyridine or phenyl acetylene dissolved in ethanol) promoted immobilization of ammonium. Emulsified 2-ethynylpyridine and acetylene were equally effective inhibitors of ammonium oxidation and had little or no effect on gross rates of N mineralization and immobilization. Four inhibitors of nitrite oxidation were evaluated, but this approach was compromised by the nonspecificity of three of the compounds\u2014potassium cyanide, 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylthio-s-triazine (ametryne) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (DMU)\u2014and by the partial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11577012750146844258", "cites_id": ["11577012750146844258"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00171934", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YrarNMLPqaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
