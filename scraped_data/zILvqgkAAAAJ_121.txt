The level of scientific understanding of these rapid cloud adjustments\u2014otherwise known as semi-direct effects (SDEs)\u2014is considered low, with models indicating a likely negative (\u22120.44 to +0.1\u2009Wm\u22122) forcing. Recent studies suggest this negative SDE is primarily driven by decreases in high-level clouds and enhanced longwave cooling. Here, we investigate the SDE using multiple models driven by observationally constrained fine-mode aerosol forcing without dust and sea salt. Unlike aerosol simulations, which yield a relatively vertically uniform aerosol atmospheric heating profile with significant upper-tropospheric heating, observation-based heating peaks in the lower-troposphere and then decays to zero in the mid-troposphere.
