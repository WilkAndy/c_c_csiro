Soil scientists, therefore, need to contribute technology to land management in a holistic way to satisfy society's requirements. They must also help formulate public policy, contribute to public understanding of environmental issues, and be alert to opportunities provided by new knowledge to improve soil and land management. Close cooperation with land owners and managers is necessary. Appropriate training of soil scientists is needed to prepare them for these responsibilities. Training in the natural sciences is a prerequisite for both vocational and research careers in soil science. This basic training should be concurrent with, or followed by, adequate exposure to the principal subdisciplines of soil science. Training in team-based problem solving is essential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14158128105188370473", "cites_id": ["14158128105188370473"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Fulltext/2000/01000/Soil_Science_Education_and_Society.10.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KSg6qn_Ge8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
