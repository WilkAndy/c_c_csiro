A method was developed to calculate the symbiotic dependence of the legume in a mixed stand based on 15N enrichment of the associated non-legume and the estimate of fixed N transfer. Published field data were used to illustrate the application of the method. Complementary treatments for verifying N transfer and options for increasing the accuracy of estimates of N transfer are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5677368273502221378", "cites_id": ["5677368273502221378"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00418677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QjQsYV0Qyk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
