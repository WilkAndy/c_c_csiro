Fixed-N was resistant to mineralization, but was more readily available than the indigenous organic-N. Approximately 20% of the fixed-N was recovered as inorganic-N after 70 days of incubation, or was recovered in the roots and three cuttings of rye-grass grown for 197 days, whereas less than 10% of the indigenous organic-N was recovered. With increasing time, the fixed-N becomes more resistant to mineralization, becoming similar to the indigenous organic-N."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13253108394176689433", "cites_id": ["13253108394176689433"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071779900117", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GTWm1N1_7LcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 2, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
