The fertilizer was applied 24 days after sowing. Distribution of the applied nitrogen (N) in the soil, N uptake by plants, and losses by ammonia (NH3) volatilization and denitrification were measured. This method of fertilizer application resulted in concentration of the applied N in the furrow and shoulder zone of the soil beds; little of the applied N moved across to the centre of the beds. Inorganic N was not leached into the clay B horizon, but was retained by the surface 0-200 mm layer. A 15N mass balance showed that 28 kg of the 80 kg N ha-1 applied (35%) was lost during the experiment. Less than 5 kg N ha-1 (6% of the applied N) was lost as NH3 and the remainder (22 kg N ha-1 or 29% of the applied N) appeared to be lost by denitrification. The 15N balance data suggest that c. 4.6 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2331963088677072079", "cites_id": ["2331963088677072079"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR9880793", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z2zr6RLMXCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
