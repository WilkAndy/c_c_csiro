Isotope dilution using added labeled NO3 allowed for the simultaneous determination of nitrification and NO3 reduction in the sediment\u2010water column. The contribution of internal NH4 pools in bottom sediment to NO3 content in water column through diffusion and nitrification was measured. Nitrate reduction averaged 134 \u00b5mol m\u22122 h\u22121 over a 50\u2010d incubation period in the sediment\u2010water columns. Nitrification averaged 90 \u00b5mol m\u22122 h\u22121, approximately 70% of the denitrification rate. Nitrification and ammonium assimilation were also determined in lake water using 15N\u2010labeled NH4 as a tracer. The nitrification rate determined in the water (0.9\u20131.4 mmol N m\u22123 d\u22121) was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=21087486519868672", "cites_id": ["21087486519868672"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600030007x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AP04D_XqSgAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
