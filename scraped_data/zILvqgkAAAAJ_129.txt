The amount of N2O evolved from the system ranged from 0.07 to 1.3 mg N day\u22121, or 1.5\u201325.5 kg N ha\u22121yr\u22121, respectively. Liming the soil or increasing the NH4+-N in the wastewater increased the emission of N2O from the system. The N evolved as N2O did not exceed 1.2% of the applied NH4+-N, indicating N2 to be the major denitrification end product in the overland flow wastewater-treatment system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11751872630750475759", "cites_id": ["11751872630750475759"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071781900626", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:73WEweQJF6MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 3, "1984": 3, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1}}
