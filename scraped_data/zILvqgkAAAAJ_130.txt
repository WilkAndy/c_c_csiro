There is compelling evidence that NO2\u2013 accumulation due to the agriculturally-induced inhibition of NO2\u2013-oxidizing organisms is a precursor to both the biogenic and abiotic formation of N2O. We identified five diverse but distinct sources of NO2\u2013 accumulation in agroecosystems; alkaline soils fertilized with acid-hydrolysing N fertilizers; acidic, neutral and alkaline soils fertilized with alkaline-hydrolysing N fertilizers; steam-sterilized soils; urine patches; and compost piles. Temperature extremes and alkalinity, either acting alone or in combination, were the predisposing factors for NO2\u2013 accumulation.
