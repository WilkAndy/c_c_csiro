Two water salinity treatments (channel water; ECw = 0.07 and groundwater; 2.4 dS m\u22121) and four irrigation frequencies were included in a factorial design with four replicates. The channel water treatments were irrigated when pan evaporation minus rainfall equalled 50 mm, whereas the groundwater treatments were irrigated at deficits of 40, 50, 65 or 80 mm. Cumulative dry matter of the clover was significantly less in treatments irrigated with saline groundwater compared to channel water at day 164, and soil salinities (ECe) increased on average from 2.3 to 5.07 dS m\u22121. In contrast, salinity of the irrigation water had no effect on the cumulative yield of grass.
