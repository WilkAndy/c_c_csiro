The early growth and leaf area development of both cultivars was reduced by both waterlogging (WSC) and water stress (1) effects compared to the frequently irrigated (F) treatment. Both cultivars acclimated to the WSC conditions and resumed active growth rates comparable to the F treatment. Excessive dry matter accumulation into leaves and stems of Ridley under WSC resulted in severe lodging and significantly reduced grain yield compared to Ridley under F irrigation. The physiological analysis presented showed that under WSC Ridley had a substantially lower light use efficiency compared the F \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16115978983581517960", "cites_id": ["16115978983581517960"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00262355", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iIgJ3H91p98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
