These effluents tend to be similar, with pH values in the range 7.6\u20138.0 together with high water-soluble ammonium and potassium but lower concentrations of calcium, sodium, and magnesium. There is little experimental information on the behaviour of these mixed ion systems in soils, so the effects of artificial but chemically similar effluents were examined in absorption experiments on columns of \u2018natural\u2019 soils. In one series of experiments, NH4+ was excluded from the artificial effluent to assess the consequences of its presence or absence. Water content and solute concentration data scaled according to distance divided by the square root of time in experiments terminated at different times. This showed that basic flow and reaction equations were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11148311794998404746", "cites_id": ["11148311794998404746"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR04008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:imYt4oLCtpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
