The athlete\u2019s \u2018response-to\u2019 and \u2018withdrawal-from\u2019 the RPT were assessed. The athlete (stature: 1.77 m, mass: 81.5 kg) completed the RPT intervention throughout a competitive season. Performance testing was conducted at; baseline, post-intervention (8-weeks) and after withdrawal-from the RPT (16-weeks). Jump height and throwing distance were assessed via countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long-jump (SLJ) and one-arm (1-MBT) and two-arm (2-MBT) medicine-ball throws respectively. Speed and agility were assessed by 5 m and 10 m sprints and \u2018sideways\u2019 and \u2018four-corner\u2019 tests respectively. A positive change from baseline to post-intervention (8-weeks) was observed in: CMJ (+0.07 m), SLJ (+0.13 m), 1-MBT (+2.25 m) and 2-MBT (+0.26 m). Observed changes in speed and agility were minimal. At the 16-weeks, small declines in CMJ, SLJ, 1-MBT and 2-MBT (0.04 m, 0.04 m, 0.52 m and 0.05 respectively) existed. Small improvements in 5 and 10 m sprint times (-0.12 s to -0.09 s) and side-ways agility were observed (-0.11 s to -0.39 s), possibly explained by conditioning effects of training and competition. An 8-week Badminton-specific RPT programme provided favourable increases in jumps and MB throws. However, such positive changes were not sustained following the withdrawal period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:n3EzUUUxItQC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16674219159578996096", "cites_id": ["16674219159578996096"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/23880", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gO23Wfu5ZucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
