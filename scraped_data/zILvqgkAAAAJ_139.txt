The general idea is that plants have choice, resulting in preference for either one mineral N form or the other. Unfortunately, there is no specific definition of preference or agreement on how it should be measured. In this review, we critically examine the alternative techniques that have been used to measure the relative uptake of NH4+ and NO3\u2212 by plants, including those based on unlabelled sources, 15N\u2010enriched mineral N forms and variations in the 15N natural abundance of mineral N sources. The main difficulty with using unlabelled N is the antecedent N in plant tissue prior to the imposition of treatments. Although 15N\u2010enrichment overcomes this obstacle, it is nevertheless difficult to separate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:6v-M-8x1n4sC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8805676768226016513", "cites_id": ["8805676768226016513"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.13069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AX0FwV0MNHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
