The exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soils at the Wagga Wagga Effluent Plantation Project increased from <2% to >25% at some depths within the surface 0\u00b76 m of soil, after 5 seasons of irrigation with either (i) treated sewage effluent or (ii) bore water with similar salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). A survey of dispersion index (DI) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) was carried out to investigate the effects of increased soil sodicity on soil physical properties. The Ksat was measured after 5 irrigation seasons at 2 depth intervals (0\u00b715-0\u00b745 m and 0\u00b75-0\u00b78 m) using both bore water and distilled water, and compared with measurements made at the same sites using bore water before irrigation commenced. Both DI and ESP were measured at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=121127129296422693", "cites_id": ["121127129296422693"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/S97064", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JUdgentUrgEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 11, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 14, "2011": 12, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
