In 1991, the US Food and Drug Administration approved succimer (2, 3-meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid) for lead chelation therapy in asymptomatic children with blood lead levels greater than 45 \u03bcg/dL. Oral succimer therapy was chosen over parenteral calcium disodium edetate treatment in this patient because of succimer\u2019s ease of administration, lack of major adverse effects, greater effectiveness in reducing blood lead levels, and greater specificity without a significant excretion of essential minerals. The literature supports the successful and safe chelation of lead with oral succimer therapy in patients without continued lead exposure (15\u201318, 21\u201325). Because the oral administration of certain chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine, may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:NhPt34oIT7EC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3491342214951935226", "cites_id": ["3491342214951935226"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/pec-online/Fulltext/2002/06000/Acute_pediatric_lead_poisoning__Combined_whole.13.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-hyJHz-9czAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
