Estimates of Patm generally increased as the rate of fertilizer N applied to the reference plant increased from 20 to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6821359009136571526", "cites_id": ["6821359009136571526"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003807179190020K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hvT-sOBVql4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
