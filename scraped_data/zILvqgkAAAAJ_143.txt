We conducted a high-level desktop analysis of farm typologies and established that if mitigation actions were fully implemented across dairy and sheep/beef farms, losses of N and P could have been decreased by up to 16 and 23%, respectively, compared to the estimated losses for 2015 (where established actions were only partially implemented). Potential decreases were greater for dairy land (34% N and 26% P) because of its greater per hectare yield and number of mitigation actions available before land use change is required. If established and developing mitigation actions were fully implemented by 2035, potential N, P and sediment losses may decrease by up to 34, 39 and 66 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:5PnCxSpcA8MC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8611331096314151686", "cites_id": ["8611331096314151686"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288233.2020.1844763", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BoMU3wGYgXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
