The soil was infiltrated with 0.1M NaCl, 1 or 10 mM SO2-4 , 1 mM F-, 1 mM Al, 1 mM Al with 1 or 10 mM SO2-4 , and 1 mM Al with 1 or 10 mM F- in a background of 0.1 M NaCl. The pH of the infiltrating solution was adjusted to 3.0. The inflowing solutions all caused a decrease in pH (relative to the initial value) near the column inlet and an increase further away from the inlet. The distance over which the change near the inlet occurred was greatly increased when Al was included in the inflow solutions. The magnitude of the pH change was affected by the accompanying anion; both SO2-4 and F- resulted in a higher pH, with 10 mM F- causing the greatest effect.
