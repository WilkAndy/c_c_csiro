We aimed to evaluate the use of a colorectal PROM and conducted a focus group to further explore this and other unmet needs in our patient population treated surgically for colorectal cancer.A multidisciplinary research group consisting of colorectal surgeons, nurse specialists, psychologists, sociologists and patient representatives devised a composite tool of new and existing outcome measures which was piloted in our local population (n = 35).
