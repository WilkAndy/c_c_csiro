Measurements were made regularly throughout the growing season using diffusion chambers. The application of urea-N led to an increase in nitrous oxide evolution; however, the emissions from the fertilized soil in 105 days were low, ranging from 90 to 171 g N ha-1. Nitrous oxide emission was found to be correlated with the exchangeable NH4 ++-N content of the soil and the NO2 -NO3 --N concentration of the floodwater. The corresponding emission from the unfertilized soil averaged 74 g N ha-1. The apparent fertilizer N recovery in the aboveground portion of the plant ranged from 43 to 71%; however, the fertilizer induced emissions of nitrous oxide represented only 0.01 to 0.05% of the urea-N applied.
