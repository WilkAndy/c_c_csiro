The river receives both point source and nonpoint source input of nutrients. Data were used to characterize the water quality and trophic state in the river. In addition nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen assimilation rates were estimated. Transformations of added [15N]\u2010labelled nitrogen in water and sediment were measured seasonally at sites on the Calcasieu River. Nitrification rates were determined by adding 15NH4 + and measuring the rate of 15NO3 appearance. Denitrification was determined using 15N tracer and acetylene blockage techniques. Nitrification occurred in the oxidized surface of the bottom sediment from the Calcasieu River and minimally in the overlying water. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river suggest that the Calcasieu \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3746195076023146626", "cites_id": ["3746195076023146626"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10934529109375697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:glitzZIo_TMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 4}}
