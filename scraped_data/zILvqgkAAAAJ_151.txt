The study evaluated maize yields on twenty farms against measures of soil fertility, agronomic attributes and soil water availability. Correlations between yield, soil fertility, rain, crop density, and weed biomass, were low, and no single factor could explain the low yields. A 50-year virtual experiment was then set up using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to explore the interactions between climate, crop management (sowing date and nitrogen fertilization) and rooting depth on grain yield and nitrate (NO3-N) dynamics. The analysis showed that a lack of optimal sowing dates that synchronize radiation, rainfall events and nitrogen (N) management with critical growth stages explained the low farm yields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:q7xreA_uRSAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2586159209304864393", "cites_id": ["2586159209304864393"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/834730", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ibY4Sxni4yMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
