This task can be cast as feature selection within a pattern recognition context. Medical data are usually of the \"wide\" type where the number of features is substantially larger than the number of instances. With the abundance of feature ranking methods, it is difficult to pick the most suitable one and choose a final consistent feature subset. Ensembles of ranking methods have been recommended for the task but their stability and accuracy have not been evaluated across different ranking methods. Here we present a case study consisting of 429 samples of exhaled air from smokers, 83% of whom suffer from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The task is to identify a discriminative subset of the 1929 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured through mass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:KmnQujDrscgC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1760166217568522558", "cites_id": ["1760166217568522558"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6406422/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PpHQX9ldbRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
