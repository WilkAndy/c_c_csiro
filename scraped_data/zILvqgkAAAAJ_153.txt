The study was conducted in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation region of south-eastern Australia using 0.3 m by 0.3 m microplots fertilized with 15N-labelled urea (10 g N m-2; 5 atom% 15N). Acetylene was effective in slowing the nitrification of both unlabelled and labelled N. Nitrate derived from the added fertilizer reached a maximum 19 days after sowing in the treatment without CaC2, whereas little nitrate accumulated in the 8 g CaC2 m-2 treatment. There was significant immobilization of the urea N by 19 days after sowing in all treatments, but the extent of immobilization was not affected by the acetylene.
