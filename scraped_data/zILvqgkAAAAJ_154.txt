Ortho\u2010P, total\u2010P, NH4+\u2010N NO3 \u2010N and TKN in surface water collected from streams feeding Lake Verret averaged 104, 340, 59, 185, and 1,060 mg 1\u22121, respectively. Lake Verret surface water concentrations of ortho\u2010P, total\u2010P, NH+\u2010N, NO3\u2212\u2010N and TKN averaged 66, 191, 36, 66, and 1,292 \u03bcg 1\u22121. The higher N and P concentrations were located in areas of the lake receiving drainage. Nitrification and denitrification processes were significant in removing appreciable inorganic N from the system. In situ denitrification rates determined from acetylene inhibition techniques show the lake removes 560 mg N m\u22122 yr\u22121. Laboratory investigations using sediment receiving 450 \u03bcg NH+4\u2010N (N\u201015 labeled) showed that the lake has the potential to remove up to 12.8 g N m\u22122 yr\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4161782703377871098", "cites_id": ["4161782703377871098"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1990.tb01399.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-vAzk1GfwTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
