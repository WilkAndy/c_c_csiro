Increased absorption of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide was obtained by increasing the permanganate surface area relative to that of the soil, increasing the temperature, decreasing the soil water content, and decreasing the depth of the soil. These factors should be considered in studies where nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide evolution is to be determined in closed systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12868771253579748670", "cites_id": ["12868771253579748670"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1979/12000/Factors_Affecting_the_Determination_of_Nitric.2.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PhVhAUYPl7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
