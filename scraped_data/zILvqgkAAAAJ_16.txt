Changes in soil salinity, sodicity, alkalinity, and the accumulation of potentially toxic elements after 2 and 4 irrigation seasons were studied. The average sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and electrical conductivity (EC) of effluent were 4\u00b78 and 0\u00b779 dS/m, while in bore water they were 3\u00b73 and 0\u00b770 dS/m, respectively. Effluent was applied at 3 rates: the water-use rate of the plantation less rainfall (medium treatment, M), a nominal rate 0\u00b75 times M (low treatment, L), and a nominal rate 1\u00b77 times M (high treatment, H). The bore-water treatment (W) was irrigated at its water-use rate less rainfall. Salinity of saturation paste extracts in the surface 0\u00b705 m increased from a pre-treatment value of 1 dS/m to 2\u20133 dS/m after 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4693236948880498645,11548117453534041491", "cites_id": ["4693236948880498645", "11548117453534041491"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/S95080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1Z_CoCO6IUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 6, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 10, "2007": 11, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 11, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
