The structure of these methods, their comparative advantages and efficacy are scrutinized in the present review. Methods are either direct or indirect, the former involving labelling of the legume with 15N2, the substrate for symbiotic N2 fixation, while in the indirect methods the legume is either enriched or depleted in 15N through addition of labelled fertilizer or is otherwise unamended at 15N natural abundance. The methods can be classified further according to their yield dependency, and whether they involve the relocation of residues or are located in situ as green manures or harvest residues. The greatest number of studies has involved the relocation of 15N-labelled plant materials produced artificially at locations remote from the actual crop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:tVzLobxzA7YC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1492489476133688205", "cites_id": ["1492489476133688205"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-017-9842-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jRP1X0VjthQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
