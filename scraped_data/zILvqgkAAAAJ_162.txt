Experimental data are presented that show that fallow management, in particular that of weeds and residue cover, not only affects the amount of water stored or lost during the summer, but also has an effect on the loss of water past the root zone during the subsequent growing season. Model simulations capture these effects and a scenario analysis indicates that retaining residues past sowing increases the risk of deep water loss relatively rapidly. This suggests that managing weeds and residues according to seasonal conditions has the potential to balance the agronomic benefits and environmental impacts of water storage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14652283601831500736", "cites_id": ["14652283601831500736"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2004/symposia/6/2/1187_verburgk.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wJtyA05eV8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
