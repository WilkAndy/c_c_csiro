Applied water salinities of 100, 1000, 3000, and 6000 mg-^ (0.1, 2.0, 4.2, and 9.2 dS m'^, respectively) were used on no-till furrows that had been irrigated with these same salinity waters since 1986. The analyses was complicated by moderately cracking red-brown earth and poor soil structure. Infiltration was characterized by a fitted Kostiakov equation added to a constant term representing the volume of water required for crack filling. Infiltration rates declined 30-50% over the season, although higher salinity treatments tended to have slightly higher basic intake rates than the control at the same time in the season. The highest salinity treatment had the highest infiltration rate at the end of the season.
