Parwan) subjected to a factorial combination of three irrigation (rainfed, irrigated at 45 mm deficit, or irrigated at 85 mm deficit) and three15N fertilizer treatments (2.8, 4.5 and 9.1 g N m\u22122) was investigated. The crop was grown on a heavy clay soil in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region of south-eastern Australia. Increasing the N application at sowing from 2.8 to 9.1 g N m\u22122, increased the accumulation of fertilizer N in barley grain from 0.36 to 2.0 g N m\u22122. Soil N was the major source of N in the grain and plant. Nitrogen uptake was not affected by the irrigation treatment or the application of N fertilizer. Nitrogen content of the grain was 1.57, 1.53 and 1.66% for crops receiving 2.8, 4.5 and 9.1 g N m\u22122 of fertilizer N at sowing, respectively. Nitrogen harvest index was unaffected by irrigation and fertilizer N application and averaged 81% (range 78 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=592415177388273263", "cites_id": ["592415177388273263"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01064173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:by7HD3euOAgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
