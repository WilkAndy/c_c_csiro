Denitrification in the sediment was estimated by using acetylene to inhibit the reduction of N2O to N2 and measuring N2O accumulation. The presence of the rhizosphere, which is usually considered to be oxidized, stimulated denitrification 6 days after the injection of 5 g NH4Cl\ue5f8N/m2 into the sediment. The enhanced denitrification rate in the sediment cores with aerial plant material was reduced to the level found in systems without aerial plant material at 9 days. Actively growing S. alterniflora apparently assimilates inorganic soil N before any appreciable gaseous N forms can be lost via nitrification-denitrification reactions in the root rhizosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4307037566205858899", "cites_id": ["4307037566205858899"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0098847284900649", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U5T2x9irxTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
