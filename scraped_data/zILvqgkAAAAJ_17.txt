However, clinicians continue to debate the clinical effectiveness of this tool.Prospective analysis of data from the International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS), an international observational study of elective in-patient surgery, accompanied by a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. The exposure was surgical safety checklist use. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. In the ISOS cohort, a multivariable multi-level generalized linear model was used to test associations. To further contextualise these findings, we included the results from the ISOS cohort in a meta-analysis. Results are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.We included 44 814 patients from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:TkcythnwBekC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10128164676946540274", "cites_id": ["10128164676946540274"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091217539458", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8rYOxBx4jowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 16, "2020": 28, "2021": 24, "2022": 34, "2023": 7}}
