This study investigated the effectiveness of a new source of such materials, the humate- or fulvate-rich products of oxidation (hydrogen peroxide) of Loy Yang brown coal. The products were characterised by physical and spectroscopic measurements and by elemental analysis. Two products, one approximately half fulvate (fulvate-rich), the other predominantly humate (humate-rich) were mixed with CaCl2 and then used to treat columns of an acid red podzol soil from Book Book, NSW. Leachate fractions were collected and analysed for pH, ionic strength, and concentration of Ca, Mg, K, Mn, Fe, and Al. After leaching (3 pore volumes), each soil column was sectioned and exchangeable Ca and Al contents were determined. The results were compared with those obtained from lime-treated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10931268106722656023", "cites_id": ["10931268106722656023"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR01032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F7_CPW2qs5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
