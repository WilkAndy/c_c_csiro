Ten replicate grab samples (0.1 m\u00b2) were taken for macrofaunal analysis (sieved through 500 um mesh) and additional grab sample for physico-chemical measurements, which gave the following results. I) Sedimentary organic carbon decreased with depth and median grain size from 5.26 mgg? 10 3.94 mgg! Chlorophyll a also generally decreased with depth but there was a peak at 100 m of 1.45 ugg-?. ATP had variable measurements with depth with values around 200. II) A total of 379 macrofaunal species comprising 11 548 individuals was identified, with polychaetes the dominant group representing 58% of the species and 66% of the abundance. Average species number and abundance both showed significant decline with depth. Diversity and evenness were both high, although the size of the macrofauna was in general rather small. III) Ten dominant species had variable distributions with depth.
