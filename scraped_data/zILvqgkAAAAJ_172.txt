Flow rates are 0.13 L/s (low), 0.38 L/s (medium), and 0.61 L/s (high). Tests are repeated four times at two\u2010week intervals over the irrigation season. Infiltration measurements are made over 10\u2010m long furrows for a minimum of five hours of outflow. Increasing the flow rate, with commensurate increases in wetted perimeter and depth of water in the furrow, increases the volume infiltrated into the nontilled beds on these soils. Because of this effect, the depth of water in the furrow should be maintained as high as possible without flooding the surface of the beds. Narrow spacing between furrows and the presence of crop residues in the furrow may also be beneficial. The volume infiltrated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14732523397568465798", "cites_id": ["14732523397568465798"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1990)116:5(714)", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hgszTflvdMwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
