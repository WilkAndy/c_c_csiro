Australia. In general there was a parabolic distribution of roots with low root length densities in the furrow (saturated soil zone) and centre of the bed (dry zone). Maximum root length density (20 cm cm\u22123) occurred at the base of the plants, approximately 300 mm from the furrow under wet soil culture. Roots were confined to the wet aerated zone which was determined by the permeability of the soil."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1870333543734126348", "cites_id": ["1870333543734126348"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02370678", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DCfF1XLC9BkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
