Gas is generated by reaction of ammonium sulphate with alkaline hypobromite in an evacuated system. The design of the apparatus and its recommended mode of operation overcome the problem of air contamination of samples. The gas is cleaned by liquid nitrogen freezing and is transferred to a sample tube with a Toepler pump, so that it can be analysed quickly and conveniently on a mass spectrometer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12059605680971757267", "cites_id": ["12059605680971757267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000326700184006X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:07aa6XhTXKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 4, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
