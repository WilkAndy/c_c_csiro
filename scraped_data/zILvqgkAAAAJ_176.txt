Recent research and practice, however, have provided ample evidence for negative effects of both potassium (K) and Mg on soil physical properties in addition to Na. This paper (1) discusses a proposed irrigation water quality parameter which generalizes SAR by including the Potassium Adsorption Ratio (PAR) along with two adjustable numerical coefficients for the K and Mg concentrations to reflect their role as dispersive cations; (2) discusses the tradeoffs from including K and the complex effects of Mg in irrigation water quality assessment; (3) analyzes water quality using the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:4opXj0ecdLoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2348405685741867901", "cites_id": ["2348405685741867901"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837742100319X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fdMmX4c2lyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
