The use of no-till (or zero-till) has been promoted as a practice that maximises the retention on organic residues to reverse or slow the loss of soil organic matter. However, the terms are misnomers because sowing the crop disturbs the soil. The definitions of conservation tillage systems should be used, including quantifying the mass of residue return to the system. Over 116 research papers that used 15N natural abundance, 15N depleted or 15N enriched isotopic techniques were reviewed to quantify the impact of tillage, especially no-till, on the N dynamics of cropping systems. The negative effects of no-till on crop yields at low fertiliser N applications were reported in numerous studies that had operated for short periods, with a few conducted on a long-term basis (>10-15 years). Based on the cumulative research, we concluded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:HDalfDz31moC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6013226499055646653", "cites_id": ["6013226499055646653"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198719308001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vXctNqRFc1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
