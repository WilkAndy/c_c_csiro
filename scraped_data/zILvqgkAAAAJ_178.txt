The number of communities irrigating tree plantations to treat their sewage effluent (one major source of nutrients) has grown rapidly in recent years. However, because of inadequate scientific data on the fate of water, nutrients, salt, and toxins under these conditions, the design and management of many effluent-irrigated plantations may create short-and long-term degradation of soil and water resources. The Wagga Wagga Effluent Plantation Project is a 6-year study of the potential productivity and limitations to the sustainability of this form of land management. The project is unique in its holistic and multi-disciplinary approach to studying the processes in this ecosystem, integrating the disciplines of tree physiology, plant nutrition, soil science, hydrology, silviculture, and modeling. A detailed model (APSIM for effluent) has been developed to extrapolate results to a wide range of sites and climates.A comprehensive national guideline for effluent-irrigated plantations (\u201cPrinciples and practice of effluent-irrigated plantations in Australia\u201d) has been prepared, based on the results of the work done by the research team of the Wagga Wagga Effluent Plantation Project. This guide will assist local governments, consultants, water authorities, rural industries, and environmental regulators design and manage environmentally sound effluent-irrigated plantations. A manual published earlier (Myers et al. 1995) discusses the issues associated with sustainable plantation design and management. The project was awarded the BHP Landcare \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7514166663882513314", "cites_id": ["7514166663882513314"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris-Smith-63/publication/242293071_Environmentally_Sound_Management_of_Water_and_Nutrients_in_Australian_Effluent-irrigated_Plantations/links/00b4952e9677e997d1000000/Environmentally-Sound-Management-of-Water-and-Nutrients-in-Australian-Effluent-irrigated-Plantations.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:opvM38SuR2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
