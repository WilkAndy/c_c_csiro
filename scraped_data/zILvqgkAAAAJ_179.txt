Published data from three pot experiments were used to illustrate different methods for estimating N transfer. Yield-dependent and yield-independent methods based on measurement of the 15N enrichment of the whole legume biomass  at harvest overestimate N transfer. Estimates of N transfer using a yield-independent method based on the 15N enrichment of the legume roots at harvest were inconsistent with estimates based on the isotopic composition of the whole plant. We propose a new mathematical concept for estimating the transfer of legume N based on measurement of the \u2018mean pool abundance\u2019 of the legume biomass during the period of N transfer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12589537882434291731", "cites_id": ["12589537882434291731"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003740050237", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E8jReAAGt64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
