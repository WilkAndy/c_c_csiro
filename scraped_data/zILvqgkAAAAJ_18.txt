A two year study of the release of N2O from adjoining salt, brackish, and fresh marsh sediment indicates that the annual emission was 31, 48, and 55 mg N m\u22122 respectively. Emission from open water area was less than the corresponding emission from the marsh sediment. In vitro experiments indicate that the N2O emission was increased when the sediment was drained for extended periods of time. The addition of NO3\u2212 significantly increased the rate of N2O evolution, indicating that a large potential for denitrification exists in the anoxic sediment. Appreciable losses of N2O would only be expected when the marshes receive an extraneous source of nitrate such as sewage and/or wastewater.The contribution of the Gulf Coast wetlands to the atmospheric N2O balance is estimated to be 3.3 \u00d7 109 g N2O.
