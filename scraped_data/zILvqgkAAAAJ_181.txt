Modelled estimates of the proportion of lupin N derived from the atmosphere, which were obtained independently of reference plants, were used to calculate the proportion of lupin N derived from the soil.Total uptake of N and S and uptake of labelled N and S increased during crop development. Total uptake of S by canola was higher than lupins, but labelled S uptake by lupins exceeded uptake by canola. The form of N applied had no effect on uptake of labelled and unlabelled forms of N or S. Ratios of labelled to unlabelled S and ratios of labelled to unlabelled N derived from soil sources decreased during growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=505973729292621528", "cites_id": ["505973729292621528"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00010346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2JYqEG2UBQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
