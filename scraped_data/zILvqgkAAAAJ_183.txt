This mobility is affected by anion adsorption at soil surfaces. Our work examines nitrate (NO3\u2212) adsorption during non\u2010steady, unsaturated absorption of NO3\u2212 solution by columns of dry Red Ferrosol (Inceptic Eutrudox), approximating solute transport in unsaturated field soils. The experiments, in which no water flows past the end of the column, show that the application of conventional water and reactive solute flow equations is valid. The profiles of water and NO3\u2212, measured at different horizontal infiltration times, coalesce on to unique curves when plotted as a function of the Boltzmann variable, \u03bb. Anion adsorption delays the NO3\u2212 advance relative to that of water. Pragmatically, we use Freundlich and Langmuir equations as convenient mathematical descriptions of how the NO3\u2212 is partitioned between the soluble and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9672718532878090387", "cites_id": ["9672718532878090387"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2011.01417.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k0CJ5EFmPIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2}}
