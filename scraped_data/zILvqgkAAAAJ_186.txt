The 15N-enriched sediment was incubated on the lake bottom for periods up to 337 days. At intervals, triplicate samples were taken and analyzed for inorganic NH4+, organic N, and denitrification rates. Concentrations of NH4+ in the 15NH4+ enriched sediment samples were at levels similar to those measured in vertical intact cores removed from the lake at each sampling date. The initial and final isotopic compositions of NH4+ in the incubated sediments were 44.26 and 0.521 atom % 15N excess, respectively. 15N enrichment in the organic N fraction increased rapidly during the first 15 days of incubation and then increased slowly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3345921160625811971", "cites_id": ["3345921160625811971"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272771485900988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A3KQcZEZby4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
