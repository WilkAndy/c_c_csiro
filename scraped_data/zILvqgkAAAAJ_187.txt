The gaseous evolution of NH 3 and N 2 O increased following the addition of (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The maximum rates of NH 3 volatilization from the salt and brackish marshes were 5.7 and 3.2 mg N m _2 d _1, respectively. The corresponding total NH 3 volatilization was 34 and 15 mg N m _2 for the salt and brackish marshes. Volatilization from unamended cores amounted to 6.0 and 0.9 mg NH 3-N m _2 from the salt and brackish marshes. Approximately 29 and 15 mg N 2 ON m _2 was evolved from the brackish and salt marsh sediment amended with 1243 and 1469 mg NH 4+-N m _2. The N 2 O evolution from the unamended cores was 0.4 and 2.2 mg N m _2 from the brackish and salt sediment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11220106737413529639", "cites_id": ["11220106737413529639"], "pub_url": "https://aquila.usm.edu/goms/vol6/iss1/1/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JyCAiaHTtZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
