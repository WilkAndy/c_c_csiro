Changes in land use to achieve greater productivity of food and fibre may have an adverse effect on the water balance and hence on the natural resource capital of a catchment. An altered regime of catchment outflow accompanies those land-use changes which, together with land degradation, impairs available water resources in quantity and quality and threatens enterprise sustainability, notwithstanding the initial improvement in productivity. Central to any hydrological change is an altered pattern of seasonal and annual water use by vegetation that has become modified in function with an amended transpiration fraction of daily evapotranspiration. In Australia, since measurement of evapotranspiration became feasible, the hydrological consequences of changes in land use have been determined, allowing the benefits in terms of plant productivity achieved through enhanced water use efficiency to be weighed against changed catchment outflows, diminished in either quantity or quality. Four case studies are presented as examples of ecological and hydrological changes: two deal with the upland forest environment and two with arable lowlands. In an upland eucalypt forest, following wildfire with subsequent regeneration from natural seedling establishment, substantial reduction in water yield occurred throughout a 50-year period of succession in the even-aged stand. In comparison, the effect of converting eucalypt forest to pine plantations was less detrimental to the yield of water from the catchments, with substantial growth increases over 30 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17847487084715310893", "cites_id": ["17847487084715310893"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/11/77/2007/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Lf_TifECr_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
