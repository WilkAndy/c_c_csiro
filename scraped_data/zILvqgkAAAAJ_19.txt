Vertical flux density was determined by monitoring the accumulation of CO2 in aluminum chambers placed over the water or sediment surfaces. Annual CO2 fluxes were 418, 180 and 618 g Cm\u22122 from the salt, brackish and freshwater marsh, respectively. Water bodies adjacent to the marsh evolved 103, 54 and 242 g CO2-Cm\u22122yr\u22121 to the atmosphere from saline, brackish and freshwater lakes, respectively. The role these marshes play in serving as a major carbon sink was determined from the carbon content of the sediment, vertical accretion rates and the bulk density of the sediment. Accretion rates were calculated from the depth in the sediment of the 1963 horizon, the year of peak 137Cs fallout. Net carbon accumulation was essentially the same in all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6269366582361039659", "cites_id": ["6269366582361039659"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272771483900422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K6NVrLBDAVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 5, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
