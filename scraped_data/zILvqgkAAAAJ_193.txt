This ion is shown to be a good tracer of energy inputs into Jupiter (J), Saturn (S) and Uranus (U). It also acts as a \u2018thermostat\u2019, offsetting increases in the energy inputs owing to particle precipitation via cooling to space (J and U). Computer models have established that is also the main contributor to ionospheric conductivity. The coupling of electric and magnetic fields in the auroral polar regions leads to ion winds, which, in turn, drive neutral circulation systems (J and S). These latter two effects, dependent on, also result in very large heating terms, approximately 5\u00d7 1012 W for Saturn and greater than 1014 W for Jupiter, planet-wide; these terms compare with approximately 2.5\u00d7 1011 W of solar extreme UV absorbed at Saturn and 1012 W at Jupiter. Thus, is shown to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:l0Ye9Vd5hjsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8364213663721869217", "cites_id": ["8364213663721869217"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2006.1877", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oU-c-wKoE3QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
