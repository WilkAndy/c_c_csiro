Among the methods proposed to date, the isotopic equilibrium approaches characteristically use N mineralization\u2010immobilization turnover processes to label the biologically labile organic N. In the present study, the implications and usefulness of the active organic N pool estimated with this approach were assessed in a long\u2010term incubation. 15N\u2010labeled NH+4 and glucose were added to soil, and the dynamics of the labeled N in the organic and inorganic phases were monitored by periodic sampling during the incubation. After appropriate revisions, two equations from the literature were used to estimate the active organic N in soil at Time 0 (OT#) and at each sampling during incubation (OT*), respectively. Both OT# and OT* tended to increase with incubation time and were affected by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7037030311630927672", "cites_id": ["7037030311630927672"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2003.1773", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OPdq3siNqGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
