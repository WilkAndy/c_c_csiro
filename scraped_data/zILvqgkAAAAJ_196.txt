The biotic (disease break) and abiotic (N supply) components of the observed benefits are identified and methods for differentiating the components are discussed. Annual measurements of the N balance of grain legume-cereal rotations are extremely variable when measured over short time periods and are therefore not useful as indicators of cropping system N sustainability. While measurement of long-term changes in total soil N is a valid index of N sustainability, this approach is impractical. We suggest an alternative avenue for the assessment of N sustainability by using simulation modelling, after validation, which takes climatic and biophysical parameters into account."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:IxV1Esw8h9cC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11817443230987199144", "cites_id": ["11817443230987199144"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-020-04578-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qCJW0AH-_6MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
