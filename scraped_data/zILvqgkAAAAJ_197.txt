The OECD, under the auspices of the IPCC, has developed a set of standard procedures for estimating greenhouse gas exchanges, including carbon dioxide exchange from forest clearning and regrowth. We present an alternative algorithm for estimating carbon dioxide exchange from forest clearing and regrowth based on a simple plant/soil model (DCDT) and compare it with the IPCC/OECD algorithm using two worked examples: constant clearing and constant regrowth of a semi-arid mallee forest in Australia. In these examples, the initial and final (equilibrium) carbon in the plant and soil are the same in both algorithms. The algorithms differ in their time scales of response. The IPCC/OECD algorithm, when compared with the DCDT algorithm, overestimates the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=282021242069848437", "cites_id": ["282021242069848437"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815297000108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dRGwUNPw6QMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
