This method of fertilizer application resulted in an uneven distribution of applied N across the soil bed. Fertilizer N was recovered mainly in the upper 0.15m horizon of the soil. Forty seven percent of the applied N was recovered in the soil and plants within 0.20m of the point of application. Recovery rapidly decreased with increasing distance from the furrow and less than 4% of the urea N was recovered by the plants in the fourth row, 0.67m from the middle of the furrow. The recovery of fertilizer N in the crop was 23, 28, 47 and 40% at 13, 32, 59 and 86 days, respectively; the corresponding total recovery in the crop plus soil was 77, 91, 87 and 75%; the mean being 83 \u00b1 8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12576863876473343837", "cites_id": ["12576863876473343837"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01050457", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xc-igQ__ia4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
