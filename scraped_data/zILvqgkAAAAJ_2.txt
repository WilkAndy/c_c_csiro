Total organic C (TOC), water-soluble organic carbon, 0.5M K2SO4-extractable organic C and 33.3mM KMnO4-oxidisable organic carbon were determined as C availability indices. For air-dried soils, these indices showed close relationship with flush of CO2 production following rewetting of the soils. In comparison, MBC determined with the chloroform fumigation\u2013extraction technique had relatively weaker correlation with soil respiration rate. After 7d pre-incubation, soil respiration was still closely correlated with the C availability indices in the pre-incubated soils, but poorly correlated with MBC determined with three different techniques\u2014chloroform fumigation extraction, substrate-induced respiration, and chloroform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 620, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11524967186639645555", "cites_id": ["11524967186639645555"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071702002742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c2uwJ5jo8J8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 14, "2005": 13, "2006": 26, "2007": 28, "2008": 23, "2009": 31, "2010": 34, "2011": 25, "2012": 29, "2013": 25, "2014": 45, "2015": 47, "2016": 32, "2017": 40, "2018": 40, "2019": 40, "2020": 40, "2021": 37, "2022": 35, "2023": 9}}
