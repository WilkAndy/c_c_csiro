Results from the first objective were presented at the 14th International Grouse Symposium in September.Sixty-four radio-marked females (52 captured in 2018, 12 captured in 2017) were monitored\u2265 3 times per week throughout the nesting and brood-rearing period. Females initiated 62 nests (53 first nests, 9 renests). Nesting frequency (\u00b1SE) was 0.97\u00b10.02, while the probability of renesting after first nest failure was 0.60\u00b10.12. Thirty-eight nests successfully hatched and 24 failed (22 depredated, 1 abandoned, 1 trampled by cattle). Of the successful nests, 6 were located on the easement and 32 on reference areas of the study site. The best predictors of nest site selection included visual obstruction (VOR) at the nest bowl, percent residual grass cover and shrub cover, and percent new grass cover and a measure of fragmentation (mean shape complexity). All variables were positively related to the relative probability of selection, with the exception of new grass cover and fragmentation, which were negatively related. Overall nest survival varied by year and was 0.48\u00b10.07 in 2018 (ranged from 0.29\u00b10.06 in 2016 to 0.48\u00b10.07 in 2018). The best predictors of nest survival were year, VOR, the proportion grassland and percent forb cover, which were all, with the exception of forb cover, positively related to survival.
