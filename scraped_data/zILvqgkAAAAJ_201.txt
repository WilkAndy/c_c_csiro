However published, recommendations for optimal frequency and duration of RPT within a typical microcycle are sparse. The aim of this case study was to assess the response to and \u2018withdrawal\u2019of incorporating one weekly 60-minute RPT session, over an 8-week period on badminton specific functional performance with an elite England under-19 badminton player.Methods:This case study featured a male England under-19 international badminton player (Age: 18 years, Height: 1.77 m, Mass: 81.5 kg), possessing two years experience of general resistance training, however with no history of any sport-specific RPT. The athlete completed the RPT intervention once-a-week during the competitive badminton season. The session featured a combination of multi-joint strength training exercises, medicine ball throws and plyometric jumps. The exercises were chosen in accordance with recommendations for elite badminton players (Sturgess & Newton, 2008) and modifications of exercises advocated to improve power (Foran, 2001; Ooi et al, 2009). Performance testing was conducted at three different time-points; baseline, post-intervention (8-weeks) and after withdrawal from the RPT programme (16-weeks), to monitor any changes in badminton specific functional performance. This followed an ABA withdrawal design as recommended for single-subject research (Kinugasa et al, 2004). Anaerobic power was assessed via a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Bl51RSoEHYIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4505998742272367028", "cites_id": ["4505998742272367028"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geoff-Middleton/publication/266388701_Does_caffeine_have_an_ergogenic_effect_on_sports-specific_agility_in_competitive_male_racquet_sport_players/links/542fcd770cf277d58e9216cf/Does-caffeine-have-an-ergogenic-effect-on-sports-specific-agility-in-competitive-male-racquet-sport-players", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tFmAd_uFiD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
