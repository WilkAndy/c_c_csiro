While surface acidity can be overcome by top-dressing with lime, amelioration of subsurface acidity is difficult because of the slow movement of lime to depth. The effectiveness of two organic (citrate and fulvate) and two inorganic calcium compounds (chloride, and phosphogypsum) in ameliorating subsoil acidity was investigated in 25 cm long columns of unsaturated soil by studying the movement of the compounds and their potential to remove exchangeable Al and reduce the Al concentration in the soil solution. Results showed that calcium citrate raised the soil solution pH from 4.5 to a maximum value of 7 in the upper portion of the column, and that calcium chloride, phosphogypsum and the fulvate solution had little effect on soil solution pH. Treatment with calcium citrate or the fulvate solution, that contained 51 mM Na \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15950728796404017365", "cites_id": ["15950728796404017365"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-0221-6_89", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1WhBalRfXN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
