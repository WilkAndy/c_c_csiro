The recovery of 15N labeled NH+4\u2010N in the NH+4, NO\u22122 + NO\u22123, and organic N pools was determined at depth within the sediment cores. Concentrations of NH+4\u2010N generally increased with depth, with largest gradients near the surface. There was significant ammonification in underlying anaerobic sediment with a consistent increase in concentration of NH+4 being observed with increasing time of incubation. Surface sediment became depleted in 15NH+4\u2010N with time of incubation due to nitrification. Nitrogen\u201015 losses occurred in the surface layer predominately from nitrification\u2010denitrification of the NH+4. Net NH+4 incorporation into the organic N fraction (immobilization) was greater in the aerobic surface sediment than in the underlying anaerobic sediment.
