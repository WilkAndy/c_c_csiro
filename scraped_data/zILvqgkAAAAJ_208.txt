Junk Publishers", "abstract": "Effect of moisture stress on photosynthesis activity ofSpartina alterniflora was studied using sediment cores taken from a Louisiana Gulf Coast salt marsh. Moisture stress was induced by evapotranspiration losses which simulate conditions that can occur when a salt marsh is not inundated by tidal cycles for extended periods. Changes in the sediment moisture from 70% to 28% when expressed as a percentage of the wet weight resulted in a rapid decrease in net CO2 fixation. The moisture content of this sediment remained above saturation throughout the experiment although the solute or osmotic potential was equivalent to being in the range between field capacity and permanent willing. Net fixation was correlated with the moisture content (r=0.92**). Plant photosynthetic activity decreased at sediment moisture levels below 70%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11176825808878529428", "cites_id": ["11176825808878529428"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02182352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lGufFtsPHJsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
