No-till is an agronomic practice to reverse or slow the loss of soil organic matter. We reviewed 95 research papers that used 13C natural abundance of soils to quantify the impact of tillage on the C dynamics of cropping systems. New C (from current cropping systems) accumulated in the surface soil under no-till, whereas the most extreme cultivation (mouldboard ploughing) mixed new C throughout the soil. There was a decline in soil C with years of cultivation. Compared with land that had been tilled, no-till generally had little impact on the accumulation on soil organic C. Tillage and residue retention caused stratification in C stocks that depended on tillage depth, with the highest C concentrations and stocks found in the surface under no-till. Shifts in the \u03b413C signature indicated significant exchange of \u2018new\u2019 C for the original \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Og6TBqsPWQcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16997138858533363114", "cites_id": ["16997138858533363114"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR21056", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qp3etLz34esJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
