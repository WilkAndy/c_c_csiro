However, problems with soil physical properties caused by wastewaters with high concentrations of K have been reported in both Australia and California. A review of the literature dating back to the 1930s supports the general conclusion that the relative order of deleterious effect on soil hydraulic properties of the four common cations in soils is Na > K > Mg > Ca. This paper explores the capabilities of the Cation Ratio of Structural Stability (CROSS), a generalized Sodium Adsorption Ratio incorporating all four cations, as an improved irrigation water quality parameter. This new parameter includes a coefficient for K that accounts for its relative deleterious effect as compared with Na and another coefficient for Mg that accounts for its relative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7076606762922573158", "cites_id": ["7076606762922573158"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377414002741", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zn0gf1soNWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 22, "2022": 18, "2023": 11}}
