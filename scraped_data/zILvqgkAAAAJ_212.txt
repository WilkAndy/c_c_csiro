Also, there is little published data with which to evaluate performance levels from this test. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine blood lactate levels following the 300 m shuttle run in four groups of participants: NRL (n= 25) and NYC (n= 33) rugby league players, and male (n= 29) and female (n= 30) PE students. Methods: All participants performed a timed 300 m shuttle run then a small blood sample was obtained by venepuncture 3\u20134 min after completing the test for blood lactate analysis (Accusport analyzer). Results: Substantial blood lactate levels were obtained in all groups with means (+ SD) ranging from 10.3+ 3.4 (NYC), 11.8+ 3.7 (Female PE \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:OlGoE9RybnsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12395698560225829655", "cites_id": ["12395698560225829655"], "pub_url": "https://www.jsams.org/article/S1440-2440(10)00726-7/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F-MUUSpeBqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
