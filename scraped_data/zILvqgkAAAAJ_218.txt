Water treatments included rainfed and irrigation at 45\u201350 mm deficit beginning in the spring.Recovery of15N in the plant increased to a maximum of about 20% within 91 days after sowing (DAS 91) and then remained constant. Approximately 16% (0.8 g N m\u22122) of the fertilizer was in the stem and leaves at DAS 91 and this N was subsequently redistributed to the head. At maturity, approximately 75% of the15N assimilated by the tops was recovered in the grain. Soil N contributed 3.6 g N m\u22122 to the head; 2.2 g N m\u22122 was remobilized from the stem and leaves, and the balance, approximately 1.4 g N m\u22122, was taken up from the soil between DAS 69 to 91.
