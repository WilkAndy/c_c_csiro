The experiments were conducted on red-brown earths in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region of south-eastern Australia. Crops were sown at monthly intervals beginning in April each year. In 1987, seeding rates were 4.6, 7.0 and 14 kg ha-1, but in 1988 and 1989 the lowest rate was eliminated. The cultivar Marnoo was used each year and Eureka was included in 1989. There was no difference between yields of seed and oil for crops sown in April and May, but yields of seed and oil declined when sowing date was delayed beyond May. Oil contents were greater than 45% for the April, May and June sowings in 1988 and 1989. In contrast, seeding rates had no effect on yields of seed and oil. Marnoo produced a maximum seed yield of 398 g m-2 from the May sowing in 1987 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16645988003975598691", "cites_id": ["16645988003975598691"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR9921629", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YxJhOOVtAucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 9, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 12, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
