This study aimed to compare resectability for colorectal cancer patients undergoing delayed versus non\u2010delayed surgery.This was an international prospective cohort study of consecutive colorectal cancer patients with a decision for curative surgery (January\u2013April 2020). Surgical delay was defined as an operation taking place more than 4\u2009weeks after treatment decision, in a patient who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy. A subgroup analysis explored the effects of delay in elective patients only. The impact of longer delays was explored in a sensitivity analysis. The primary outcome was complete resection, defined as curative resection with an R0 margin.Overall, 5453 patients from 304 hospitals in 47 countries were included, of whom 6.6% (358/5453) did not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:voRn8Q75vc8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5170193406724825439", "cites_id": ["5170193406724825439"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/codi.16117", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X2Hms4I3wEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
