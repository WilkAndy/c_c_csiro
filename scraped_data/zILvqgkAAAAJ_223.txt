The purpose of the GCM simulations has been to enhance the scientific understanding of how changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, and incoming solar radiation perturb the Earth\u2019s radiation balance and its climate response in terms of changes in temperature and precipitation. Here we provide global and annual mean results for a large set of coupled atmospheric-ocean GCM simulations and a description of how to easily extract files from the dataset. The simulations consist of single idealized perturbations to the climate system and have been shown to achieve important insight in complex climate simulations. We therefore expect this data set to be valuable and highly used to understand simulations from complex GCMs and Earth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:hiaEfdi_fzkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8544230134555014837", "cites_id": ["8544230134555014837"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01194-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tfZWwQk0k3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
