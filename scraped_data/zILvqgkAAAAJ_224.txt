Immunotherapy holds promise as a therapeutic avenue, but one of the challenges in its application is the poorly understood microenvironment of pediatric CNS tumors. The Children\u2019s Brain Tumor Network released the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas, containing the expression profile of nearly 700 primary CNS tumors. To study the immune microenvironment, a classification from The Cancer Genome Atlas project is applied. High-grade lesions are predominantly lymphocyte deplete (C4, 80%) or immunologically quiet (C5, 7.6%). Low-grade lesions are more mixed with 43% C4, 26% C5, and a higher proportion of inflammatory subtype (C3, 28%). For survival parameters, immune subtype and tumor grade are associated. Using a multivariate cox regression model, the hazard ratio is 2.2 (0.86 \u2013 5.4, p = 0.102 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:eqBW-PYUpt8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17233790922096280704", "cites_id": ["17233790922096280704"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/i27/6288248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gITm_Ii5Ku8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
