Anions were chosen to represent a range of potential abilities to form complexes with Al. They included chloride, fluoride, citrate, salicylate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, catechol, and 2 different coal-derived fulvates. Batch experiments, using a 1 : 5 soil : solution ratio, showed that citrate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and fluoride had a similar effect on Al sorption and speciation. These anions were effective in decreasing the amount of exchangeable and sorbed Al and increased the amount of complexed Al in solution. In the soil solution, very little Al was in the uncomplexed toxic form (Al3+).
