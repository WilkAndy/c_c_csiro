Patients underwent surgery in 78 hospitals from 16 countries, predominantly in Italy (n= 44), UK (n= 28) and Spain (n= 20). 112 patients with a previous positive swab were matched to 448 patients with no positive swab. In the propensity score matched model, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased odds of pulmonary complications compared to no infection (10\u22c5 7%[12/122] versus 3\u22c5 6%[16/448], adjusted odds ratio 3\u22c5 84, 95% confidence interval 1\u22c5 51-9\u22c5 74, p= 0\u22c5 004, Supplementary Figure 2). When split by time from swab to surgery, both pulmonary complications and mortality were lowest at least 4weeks after notification of a positive swab test (Table 1). However, 71\u22c5 3%(87/122) of patients had surgery within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this series. There are significant limitations of these data, including risk of selection bias and a small sample size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:n3Ahz6dV9U4C", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4114750759778966419", "cites_id": ["4114750759778966419"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article-abstract/107/12/e601/6121018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k9vk3wOIGjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 59, "2022": 33, "2023": 11}}
