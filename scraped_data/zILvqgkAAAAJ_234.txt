Condor) grown on a heavy clay soil in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region of south-eastern Australia was investigated. 15N-labelled NO                   3 -                 was applied at 2 gNm\u22122 on 7 September, 5 October and 5 November 1987 to microplots in a larger field experiment involving two irrigation treatments. The irrigation treatments were either complete irrigation until maturity or partial irrigation. Plant tops were harvested from three microplots selected at random from each treatment on 4 occasions; 7,14, 21 and 28 days after N application. Irrigation had no effect on the rate of uptake of 15N. Recovery of 15N-labelled NO                   3 -                 in the plant tops increased from 50% for the September 15N addition to 70% for the October and November additions. The low recovery of 15N in September occurred when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13555786067172280782", "cites_id": ["13555786067172280782"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00191056", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zkn-QJvTH7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
