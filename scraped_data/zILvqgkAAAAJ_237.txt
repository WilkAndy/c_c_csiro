The stability of 13C\u2010enriched biochar can be estimated by the quantitative recovery of excess 13C, either in the soil or in evolved CO2. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Recovery in the soil is a measure of both residual biochar 13C\u2009+\u200913C immobilised in soil organic matter during biochar decomposition. Variable proportions of organic\u2010 and inorganic\u2010C are present in alkaline biochars, and few data exist on the uniformity of labelling, which is a basic requirement of the respired 13CO2 and E methodology. The E technique has had limited application due to the cost and difficulty of obtaining a uniformly\u2010enriched feedstock through continuous labelling of plants with 13CO2 at a constant 13C enrichment. In contrast, the NA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:GuUNX9Xf5vwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=203493680011814928", "cites_id": ["203493680011814928"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.13245", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ECgkf2z00gIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
