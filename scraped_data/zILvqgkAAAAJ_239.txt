We reviewed the literature based on single or dual (15N, 13C) stable isotope labelling techniques to test the hypothesis of direct uptake. Both isotopically enriched and natural abundance approaches were reviewed. Of the methods examined, the dual enrichment technique, when combined with compound specific and position-specific stable isotope analysis, provided incontrovertible evidence for direct uptake of simple amino acids. We demonstrate that dual labelling lacks overall sensitivity due to the high C concentration in plant tissue relative to N, and the higher natural abundance of 13C cf. 15N, which limits the period of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:FhAcYObmztMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16869511820281177039", "cites_id": ["16869511820281177039"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10256016.2021.1932871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z-McPp-LHOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
