However, the biological meanings of the model parameters and their relationships to soil properties and environmental conditions remain to be elucidated. In the present study, 18 soils were incubated at 35\u00b0C and 55% water\u2010holding capacity (WHC) for 41 wk and two soils at 16 factorial combinations of temperature (5, 15, 25, or 35\u00b0C) and moisture (8, 11, 15, or 19%) for 29 wk. Although the model closely fitted the net N mineralization data, the model parameters often appeared to lack biological meanings and could vary with incubation time, temperature, and soil moisture in unpredictable manners. Thus, the conventional double exponential model was modified by (i) using defined mineralization rate constants for Na and Ns under standard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2920820401908795384", "cites_id": ["2920820401908795384"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2004.1256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-Md8LK7WiCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 7, "2008": 2, "2009": 9, "2010": 8, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
