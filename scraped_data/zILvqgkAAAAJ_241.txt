These\" semi-direct effects\"(SDEs) depend on the vertical co-location of absorbing aerosol and cloud and include relative humidity reductions and cloud burn-off when BC and cloud are co-located, but also enhanced low-level cloud due to increases in stability when BC is located above the cloud. The level of scientific understanding of the SDE is considered low, with models indicating a likely negative (-0.44 to+ 0.1 W/m^ 2) forcing. Recent studies suggest this negative SDE is primarily driven by decreases in high-level clouds and enhanced longwave cooling. Here, we investigate the SDE using multiple models driven by observationally constrained fine-mode aerosol forcing without dust and sea salt.
