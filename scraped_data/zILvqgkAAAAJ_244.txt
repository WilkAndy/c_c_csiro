Strength and conditioning programs have the potential to improve performance through fitness adaptations. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of strength and conditioning programs on measures of golf-specific fitness (strength, power, balance, flexibility).Methods: Studies were sourced via electronic library databases, hand searched sport science journals and scanning through relevant studies\u2019 reference lists.Results: 12 studies were identified. Most studies used middle aged to older (29\u201379yrs) male recreational golfers and 2 studies used collegiate golf students (18\u201325yrs) of both sexes. The majority of the programs ran for approximately 8 weeks and participants were required to complete 2\u20134 sessions per week for an average duration of 60\u201390 minutes.
