Fixed smears were stained for perioxidase activity (30 min), using one drop of 3,3\u2032\u2010diaminobenzidine\u2010hydrogen peroxide solution (pH 7.6) as oxidizable substrate, followed by washing, drying and microscopic examination (1000 X). the cell\u2010walls of vegetative C. botulinum type A appeared reddish brown and periphery of spores (if present), stained dark brown. However, C. botulinum type B (tox+) cross\u2010reacted (faint brown) with the same antibody\u2010HRPO\u2010conjugate. Specificity and sensitivity of this procedure compared well with the immunodiffusion method of Ferreira et al. (1981, 1983).
