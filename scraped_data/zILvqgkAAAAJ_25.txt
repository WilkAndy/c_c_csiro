The results showed that np was not always higher under waterlogged than under aerobic conditions, which differed from some previous reports. Five analytical equations were compared and used to estimate gross rates of N mineralisation, immobilisation and loss. It was elucidated that the equations based on changes in the AT and AL pools gave estimates of gross mineralization and consumption rates, with the values obtained with the equation of Shen et al.
