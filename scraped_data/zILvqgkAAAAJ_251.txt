This large water vapour perturbation means that HTHH will probably increase the net radiative forcing, unusual for a large volcanic eruption, increasing the chance of the global surface temperature anomaly temporarily exceeding 1.5 C over the coming decade. Here we estimate the radiative response to the HTHH eruption and derive the increased risk that the global mean surface temperature anomaly shortly exceeds 1.5 C following the eruption. We show that HTHH has a tangible impact of the chance of imminent 1.5 C exceedance (increasing the chance of at least one of the next 5 years exceeding 1.5 C by 7%), but the level of climate policy ambition, particularly the mitigation of short-lived climate pollutants, dominates the 1.5 C exceedance outlook over decadal timescales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:OOjdtAxccZ4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01568-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iwJtC71n9r8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
