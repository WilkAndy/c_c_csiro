Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of targets that mediate the initial cellular response to external pathogens or endogenous alarmins, activating downstream pro-inflammatory cascades and leading to the activation and recruitment of key innate subsets. TLR2 is a cell surface receptor, expressed predominantly on macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils and subsets of NK and T cells. TLR2 signaling plays important role in NK and T cell cytolytic cell functions, as well as DC and macrophage activation. AXA-042 is a novel synthetic TLR2/6 agonist designed for systemic delivery to re-engage the innate immune response to help overcome tumour immune escape.Methods: In vitro \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:cF7oVAG_41EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/82/12_Supplement/3502/702538", "cites_per_year": {}}
