Through various impact channels, the term we use to describe particular pathways through which it can affect human welfare, climate change undermines and disrupts crucial sectors of the economy, incurring significant costs to business, investors and households. This report estimates the total climate change risk for the United Kingdom based on an analysis of nine key impact channels, ranging from agriculture, livestock and fisheries to drought, flooding and coastal impacts. In each case, future impacts are translated into loss of socioeconomic welfare and reported as an equivalent loss of the UK\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). We calculate these costs for two different scenarios: under current policies and with high mitigation climate policies.
