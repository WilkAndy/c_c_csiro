Whilst frozen, peatland carbon fluxes are inhibited by cold temperatures, but emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are expected to substantially increase post-thaw. Peatland permafrost is often characterised by the presence of frost mounds, termed palsas/peat plateaus, or by ice-wedge polygons in more northerly regions. The spatio-temporal dynamics of future permafrost peatland thaw remain highly uncertain due to incomplete mapping of their modern distribution, the insulating properties of organic soils, and the variation in model projections of future climate. Here, we present simulations of the modern and future climate envelopes of permafrost peatlands in Europe and Western Siberia.
