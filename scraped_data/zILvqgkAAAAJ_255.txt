This development provided an impetus to the study of the role of B in plant nutrition, although many seminal discoveries were made beforehand without the aid of isotopes. Thus, much information on the mobility and physiological function of B in plants is post-1985. Boron is unusual in plant nutrition in that it is taken up by plants through roots or foliage as undissociated boric acid, unlike other essential elements that are taken up in ionic form. The within-plant mobility of B in species important in agriculture and horticulture is examined in the present review including the role of sugar alcohols in xylem to phloem transfer. The molecular basis of its movement at the cellular level via transporters as revealed through the strategic application of enriched \u00b9\u00b9B and \u00b9\u2070B is addressed. Few studies have been carried out on B use efficiency by crops and results show great variability. Suggestions for future applications of tracing with \u00b9\u2070B and \u00b9\u00b9B are provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:ikaq6XQmvAEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7710956", "cites_per_year": {}}
