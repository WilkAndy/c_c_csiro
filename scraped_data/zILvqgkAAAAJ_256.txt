However, these guidelines based on SI principles are being generally ignored in publications in the agricultural and biological sciences. We are not the first to draw attention to a disconnection between the end-users of stable isotope analysis and its origins in analytical chemistry, and the ramifications of this discontinuity (Bond, 2012, Coleman, 2014, Chalk, 2015). An issue addressed by the IUPAC through its Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights (CIAAW) is the widespread usage of non-SI units in reporting isotopic data, which are termed \u2018deprecated\u2019units. However, lack of SI-compliance now appears to be only one of two pending issues."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:-ptwEgtruvwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:53017633", "cites_per_year": {}}
