There was, however, no evidence supporting or disputing this theory 1, 2. Owing to the uncertainty on the role of BCG vaccine on the outcomes of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection, this international study aimed to determine whether previous BCG vaccination was associated with reduced postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and 30-day mortality in patients undergoing surgery who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This COVIDSurg study 3\u20135 was an international prospective cohort study that included patients who had surgery between 1 February and 31 July 2020 and were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 within 7days before or 30days after surgery. The primary outcome was the rate of 30-day PPC and the secondary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality rate. These were compared in patients with and without BCG vaccination. A logistic regression model was used to find the odds of association. The full methodology is available in the Appendix S2. This study included 2391 patients from 428 hospitals across 64 countries from February 2020 to July 2020. Overall, 1165 (48.9 per cent) patients were male and 524 (21.9 per cent) were aged 70years or older (Table S1). The BCG vaccine had been administered to 1649 (69.0 per cent) patients, of whom 1518 (63.5 per cent) had received it at least 15 years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:m-uhswXr2oEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/79206/Impact%20of%20Bacillus%20Calmette-Gu%C3%A9rin%20(BCG)%20vaccination%20on%20postoperative%20mortality%20in%20patients%20with%20perioperative%20SARS-CoV-2%20infection.pdf?sequence=2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5RN9qBI4XhYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
