Whilst frozen, peatland carbon fluxes are restricted by cold temperatures, but once permafrost thaws and saturated surficial conditions develop, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) substantially increase. This positive feedback mechanism threatens to accelerate future climate change globally. Whilst future permafrost distributions in mineral soils have been modelled extensively, the insulating properties of organic soils mean that peatland permafrost responses are highly uncertain. Peatland permafrost is commonly evidenced by frost mounds, termed palsas/peat plateaus, or by polygonal patterning in more northerly regions. Although the distribution of palsas in northern Fennoscandia is well-studied, the extent of palsas/peat plateaus and polygon mires elsewhere \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:s3s37ZINstAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23.7450F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
