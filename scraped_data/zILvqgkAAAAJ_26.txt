Seasonal distribution of NO3 and its transformations were measured in Four League Bay (9,300 ha). Denitrification was estimated by incubating wet samples in the presence of acetylene and monitoring N2O production. The annual sediment accumulation of N was also determined within the bay and within the adjacent marshes. Nitrogen accumulation ranged from 6.0 to 23 gN per m2 per yr on the marsh and 6.1 to 11.2 gN per m2 per yr in the bay. Denitrification in this system was controlled by the availability of NO3 \u2212 with fluxes ranging from 2 to 70 ngN per g per hr. The annual (N2O +N2)-N emission was equivalent to 142 and 120 \u03bcg per g or 2.1 and 1.7 gN per m2 from the 5 bay and 5 marsh stations, respectively.
