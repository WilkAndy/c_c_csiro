We read with interest the article by Guadalajara et al. 1, which recommends that we revert back to operative management in patients with acute inflammatory processes. We argue that these conclusions warrant further discussion, which we highlight below for further analysis.The authors selected four prominent acute general surgical conditions; however, these encompass a broad range\u2014from perianal abscess to perforated diverticulitis. Given the highly heterogeneous pathology and disease severity not clearly defined, it is hard to see how these patients can be compared. Guadalajara and colleagues\u2019 assertion that COVID-19 status does not affect mortality is contradicted by larger international studies demonstrating that postoperative mortality is significantly worse for patients with COVID-19 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:e7Kme7CWzzEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article-abstract/108/1/e50/6025927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D_Z21PItDY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
