The tiny coccolithophore produces intricate calcium carbonate disks known as coccoliths that surround the cell. In 1983 samples of E. huxleyi collected off of the coast of Peru were isolated and sent to two culture collections: 1) the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota in Bigelow Maine, and 2) the Plymouth Algal Culture Collection in England. After 20 years in culture, CCMP 1516 has lost, and PLY 217 retained its ability to calcify. As isogenic lines it is hypothesized that epigenetic changes may be responsible for these phenotypic differences. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. These changes include methylation, phosphorylation, and or ubiquitination of DNA bases and/or histone proteins that influence genome packaging and ultimately gene expression. To determine whether methylation may be an epigenetic driver of calcification in E. huxleyi, bisulfite sequencing and RNA-Seq were employed to compare DNA methylation and gene expression levels in CCMP 1516 and PLY 217. Comparisons revealed 12,800 differentially methylated regions and 14,525 differentially expressed genes. Of these, 2,037 genes were differentially expressed and differentially methylated near the transcriptional start site. To independently validate expression, 9 genes previously identified as potentially involved in biomineralization were subjected to Real Time RT-PCR. Differential expression of 5 of the 9 genes tested was confirmed, including that of a Plasma membrane type H \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:V2qoOCwHYDEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15957005992109198161&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
