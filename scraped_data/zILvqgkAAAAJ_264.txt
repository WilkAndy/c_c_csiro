However, the feedbacks driven by different forcing agents may vary in magnitude due to the geographical distribution and characteristics of the forcing. Previous studies suggest that forcings which project more strongly on the northern hemisphere, land or polar regions are more effective in changing global temperature than CO2. In this study we investigate the efficacies relative to CO2 of four different forcing agents (CH4, SO4, black carbon and solar), using idealized single forcing scenarios performed by nine global climate models participating in the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). All four forcing agents are found to have multi-model mean efficacies of less than one. Despite the forcing being predominantly concentrated in the northern hemisphere both black carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:OihgeMSZ2LIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..2019170F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
