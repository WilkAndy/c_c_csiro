The methodology used to develop the FY16 TRAC-MTRY work program starts with analyzing the impacts of the FY15 work program using a topic, technology, methodology TTM framework that examines the effects of TRAC-MTRY projects in terms of five TRAC work categories. The FY16 research elicitation consists of both a formal elicitation of research ideas from across TRAC using interviews and a workforce survey, and an informal elicitation of research needs from organizations both within TRAC and across the Army. Finally, we develop the proposed FY16 work program, assess it against the TTM framework against our established TRAC work categories and present the impacts here. A full listing of FY15 projects completed can be found in autoreftabfy15projlist. A listing of FY16 projects which are currently in the beginning stages of research can be found in autoreftabfy16projlist. This is the FY16 work program that will be executed pending any changes to priorities or additional projects that require immediate research.Descriptors:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:WN7eEiAxqlEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1001399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SABqAVeSb8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
