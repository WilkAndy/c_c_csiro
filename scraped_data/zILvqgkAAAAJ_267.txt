Unlike the Earth, solar heating has only a small effect on the thermosphere, varying little in temperature with local time, and with equatorial neutrals co-rotating with the planet due to meridional advection. Within the auroral region, ionosphere-thermosphere coupling produces strong flows and results in huge Joule Heating from auroral currents. In this region, the temperature excess can be explained, but Jupiter's fast rotation means that Coriolis forces prevent energy in the poles from transferring equatorward, so there remains no explanation of why low latitudes are overheated by a factor of 3-5 over that predicted by solar heating alone. Despite this anomaly, although the past twenty years has seen a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:kFTnOY8ORlkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMSA21A..09S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
