Participants (mean age 14.8 years, s = 0.4) were 42 boys and 26 girls who completed the study assessments on two occasions separated by one week. The following tests were conducted: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to calculate percent body fat, leg dynamometer, 90\u00b0 push-up, 7-stage sit-up, and wall squat tests. Intra-class correlation (ICC), paired samples t-tests, and typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation were calculated. The mean percent body fat intra-class correlation coefficient was similar for boys (ICC = 0.95) and girls (ICC = 0.93), but the mean coefficient of variation was considerably higher for boys than girls (22.2% vs. 12.2%). The boys' coefficients of variation for the tests of muscular fitness ranged from 9.0% for the leg dynamometer test to 26.5% for the timed wall squat test \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:0HLgouInvOQC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10936418708642592329", "cites_id": ["10936418708642592329"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02640414.2010.551215", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SfaTM9_2xZcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 14, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
