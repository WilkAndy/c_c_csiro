Such approximations, in general, are valid for large scale motions on the Earth but may break down in more exotic flow regimes such as those found for hot Jupiters. We present results of dynamical models of HD209458b solving the unsimplified dynamical equations for a rotating atmosphere, as well as models with increasing simplification to these equations. These results show that the bulk atmospheric flow is largely robust to the canonical simplifications if short integration times and small vertical domains are used (ie shallow weather layers). However, for longer integrations and models incorporating a'deeper'(ie larger in vertical extent) atmosphere such simplifications to the dynamical equations produce different flows. The presented models have all been run with the same \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:pkn4gbMRXFgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EPSC....8...12M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
