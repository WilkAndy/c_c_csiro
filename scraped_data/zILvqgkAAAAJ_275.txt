Experimental data consists of profiles of water contents, Cl concentrations, total aqueous and sorbed concentrations of the major cations. Numerical simulation of the experimental dataset requires a coupled code that can consider variably-saturated water flow, multi-component solute transport, and geochemical reactions (aqueous complexation and cation exchange). The HP1 code, based on coupled HYDRUS-1D and PHREEQC, is used to simulate this data set. The sorption of the major cations is described as a competitive cation exchange process. The objective of the study is to calibrate hydraulic, transport, and geochemical parameters using HP1, the universal optimization code UCODE_2005 (Poeter et al., 2005), and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010EGUGA..12.4639J/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9pmlHgLOi20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
