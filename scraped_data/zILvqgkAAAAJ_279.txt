When irrigation with reclaimed water results in application of more nutrients than can be caused by the crop, the excess either accumulates in the soil or is leached from it. A list of the possible constituents of reclaimed water is presented with a brief indication of their potential onsite and offsite impacts. Some of the more important and more common of the potential impacts identified are discussed such as salinity, contamination by inorganic constituents (nitrate, phosphorus, sodium and potassium) and trace constituents (heavy metals and metalloids), organic toxins, groundwater contamination, and environmental flows."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20063129540", "cites_per_year": {}}
