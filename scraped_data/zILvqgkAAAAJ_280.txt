They are much less likely to be involved in what have come to be called \u201cprole\u201d sports or sports of the lower class.   Members of the knowledge class also behave much differently at sporting events than members of the working class.  Participation in sports and how people act at sporting events are an extension of class.  Hence, sports are a reflection of social class."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:BoGTRzMZH_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5515930612846137566&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
