Replacement of perennial native vegetation by annual crops and pastures following European settlement has altered the water balance causing increased groundwater recharge and mobilising the naturally saline groundwater. The Redesigning Agriculture for Australian Landscapes Program, of which the work described here is a part, was established to develop agricultural practices that are more attuned to the delicate water balance described above. Results of field measurements will be presented that contrast the water balance characteristics of native vegetation with those of conventional agricultural plants, and indicate the functional characteristics required of new agricultural practices to reduce recharge. New agricultural practices may comprise different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.H42H..05B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
