It is very difficult to measure and often modeling is resorted to instead. But is modeling this small number any less difficult than measurement? In Australia there is considerable debate over the magnitude of recharge under different agricultural systems because of its contribution to rising saline groundwater levels following the clearing of native vegetation in the last 100 years. Hence the adequacy of measured and modeled estimates of recharge is under close scrutiny. Results will be presented for the water balance of an intensively monitored 8 year sequence of crops and pastures. Measurements included meteorological inputs, evapotranspiration measured with a pair of weighing lysimeters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUFM.H22E0394V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
