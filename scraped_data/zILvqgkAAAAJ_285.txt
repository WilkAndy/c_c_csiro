This is a problem because groundwater dissipation in the Australian landscape is slow and the change from native vegetation to annual cropping has been associated with rising water tables and the mobilisation of salt. It is ironic that in Australia, both water and nutrients limit agriculture, yet it is the loss of both beyond the root-zone of annual crops and pastures that is the fundamental cause of salinity and acidification [1].New farming systems that are more productive and reduce drainage must be introduced. This challenge is to satisfy future food and fibre demands without degrading the natural resource base critical to future generations. Farmers are being challenged to implement new'sustainable'systems of land use. It is essential that mistakes of the past are not repeated and that the environmental impacts of the proposed changes are understood before being implemented. For these reasons, it is essential to understand their soil water and chemical dynamics, and assess the findings against the resilience of the landscape to undergo change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/31/055/31055467.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w-jecWfe_4QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
