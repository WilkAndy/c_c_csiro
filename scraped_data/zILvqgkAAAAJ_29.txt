Chemical transformations of the dredged sediments were influenced by changes in the sediment\u2010water pH and oxidation\u2010reduction status. Sediment pH decreased as the redox potential (Eh) was increased in both the freshwater and saline sediment. Both sediments had near\u2010neutral pH when maintained under anoxic conditions and the minimum pH developed under oxic conditions was 5.1 and 3.0 for the freshwater and saline sediment, respectively. The acidity developed in the saline sediment resulted in the release of the potentially toxic metals Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, Cd, and Sb into solution.
