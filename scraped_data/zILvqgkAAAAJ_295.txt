It is an induced defence response that results in failure of the organism to infect. Restriction of the microorganism to the point of infec-tion is not, however, a consequence solely of the death of host cells and a number of metabolic changes are known to occur in those cells surrounding the area of necrosis. Such changes include production of pathogenesis related proteins (van Loon 1985; Bol et al. Chapter 6) and inhibitors of proteases and polygalacturonases (Walker-Simmons and Ryan 1984; Degra et al. 1988); deposition into the cell wall of lignins (Pearce and Ride 1982) and hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (Roby et al. 1985); and production of a number of enzymes, some with hydrolytic activity against com-ponents of the microorganism, for example chitinases and glucanases (Kombrink et al. 1988, and Chapter 15 this volume), and others that are concerned with synthesis of various defence-related molecules, for example the enzymes of phytoalexin synthesis (Cramer et al. 1985a). Thus the potential exists for an array of metabolic changes to be induced in association with the HR and the subsequent restriction of growth of the microorganism. Not all the changes described above will occur in a single plant of course. The HR for a given plant-pathogen interaction appears to be more characterized by the metabolic capabilities of the plant and is less dependent upon the particular pathogen involved.
