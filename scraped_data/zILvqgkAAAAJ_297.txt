A recirculating furrow infiltrometer was used to determine the effect of three flow rates on infiltration for nontilled beds established on a red- brown earth soil (heavy clay soil) in the region. Flow rates were 0.13 L/s (low), 0.38 L/s (medium), and 0.61 L/s (high). Tests were repeated four times at two-week intervals over the irrigation season. Infiltration measurements were made over 10-m-long furrows for a minimum of five hours of outflow. It was found that increasing the flow rate, with commensurate increases in wetted perimeter and depth of water in the furrow, increased the volume infiltrated into the nontilled beds on these soils. Because of this effect, the depth of water in the furrow should be maintained as high as possible without flooding the surface of the beds.
