Ortho- P, total-P, NH4(+)-N, NO3-N and Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) in surface water collected from streams feeding Lake Verret averaged 104, 340, 59, 185 and 1060 mg/L, respectively. Lake Verret surface water concentrations of ortho-P, total-P, NH4+-N, NO3-N and TKN averaged 66, 191, 36, 66 and 1292 micrograms/L. The higher N and P concentrations were located in areas of the lake receiving drainage. Nitrification and denitrification processes were significant in removing appreciable inorganic N from the system. In situ denitrification rates determined from acetylene inhibition techniques show the lake removes 560 mg N/sq m/yr. Laboratory investigations using sediment receiving 450 micrograms NH4(+)-N (15-N labeled) showed that the lake has the potential to remove \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1292377791717057610&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
