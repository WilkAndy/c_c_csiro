The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of planned delay before surgery in patients who have had SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. This international, multicentre, prospective cohort study included patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during October 2020. Surgical patients with pre\u2010operative SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection were compared with those without previous SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The primary outcome measure was 30\u2010day postoperative mortality. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted 30\u2010day mortality rates stratified by time from diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection to surgery. Among 140,231 patients (116 countries), 3127 patients (2.2%) had a pre\u2010operative SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 diagnosis. Adjusted 30\u2010day mortality in patients without SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection was 1.5% (95%CI 1.4\u20131.5).
