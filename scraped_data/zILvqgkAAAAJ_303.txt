Nonpoint source nutrient inputs, as well as sediment-interstitial and lake water nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, were measured seasonally. Sedimentation rates in the lake were determined using Cs-137 dating. Levels of toxic organics and fate of 2,4-D in the water bodies were determined. Phosphorus and nitrogen levels in the lake were found to be largely dependent on concentrations in the incoming bayou water from upland drainage. Nitrogen fixation on the order of 20-30 Hg/g/yr was measured. C-14 uptake studies indicated appreciable assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus by phyto-plankton. Laboratory equilibrium studies showed bottom sediments in the lake are a major sink for the incoming dissolved orthophosphate phosphorus. Total nitrogen concentrations in water draining into the lake generally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6322674933392904139&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
