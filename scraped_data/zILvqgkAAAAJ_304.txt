Evolved NO + NO2 is absorbed by an acid solution of potassium permanganate, and the resulting NO3- is determined by a steam distillation procedure. Gas chromatography is used to determine N2 and N20, which are separated on a single column of molecular sieve 5A by temperature programming. Evaluation of closed incubation systems demonstrated that the absorption of NO + NO2 following NO2- addition to a soil, increases with increasing trap : soil surface area and temperature, and decreases with increasing soil water content and depth of soil. Studies of fertilizer N balance and NO2 - transformations required the use of 15N-labelled materials. An apparatus and a procedure were developed to prepare 15N2 for isotope-ratio analysis by mass spectrometry.In laboratory studies, N2, N20 and NO + NO2 were evolved from soils during nitrification of NH3 fertilizer, when soil pH was alkaline. Evidence was obtained to suggest that these losses resulted from chemical reactions involving NO2- . The patterns of gaseous loss in individual soils were very similar to those obtained when NO2- was added to either ?-irradiated or nonirradiated samples. In a calcareous soil, losses were largely prevented by addition of a nitrification inhibitor, which prevented NO2 - accumulation. Nitrite accumulated when pH was alkaline, and NO2 - persistence was related directly to soil pH and inversely to organic C. Gaseous N losses measured in the laboratory did not occur in glasshouse pots treated with 15N-labelled NH3, urea or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU2019602321", "cites_per_year": {}}
