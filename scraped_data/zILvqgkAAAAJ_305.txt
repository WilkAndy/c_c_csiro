The athlete's \u201cresponse-to\" and \u201cwithdrawal-from\u201d the RPT were assessed. The athlete (stature: 1.77 m, mass: 81.5 kg) completed the RPT intervention throughout a competitive season. Performance testing was conducted at; baseline, post-intervention (8-weeks) and after withdrawal-from the RPT (16-weeks). Jump height and throwing distance were assessed via countermovement jump (CMJ), standing long-jump (SLJ) and one-arm (1-MBT) and two-arm (2-MBT) medicine-ball throws respectively. Speed and agility were assessed by 5 m and 10 m sprints and \u201csideways\u201d and \u201cfour-corner\u201d tests respectively. A positive change from baseline to post-intervention (8-weeks) was observed in: CMJ (+ 0.07 m), SLJ (+ 0.13 m), 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:hYo2n04OfVQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Gee/publication/325764030_Effectiveness_of_a_low-frequency_sports-specific_resistance_and_plyometric_training_programme_the_case_of_an_elite_junior_badminton_player/links/5b28cc210f7e9b1d0034836a/Effectiveness-of-a-low-frequency-sports-specific-resistance-and-plyometric-training-programme-the-case-of-an-elite-junior-badminton-player.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SURwqPfMVVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
