Traditional extremes of heat and other climate indices defined by the ETCCDI such as monthly maximum temperature or heatwave duration (Zhang et al., 2011) do not directly estimate the impacts on human welfare. In this work I propose to directly compute a metric of human heat stress, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI; B\u0142azejczyk et al., 2013), using CMIP6 projections. This work will build on the work of Claudia Di Napoli (U. Reading) who has used UTCI in the present climate with reanalysis data (Di Napoli et al., 2020). Claudia or others from Reading could be invited to collaborate on this project as part of the MOAP group."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:40klY_19CegC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cmip6moap.github.io/projects/10-human-heat-stress-warming-world/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nIrCwnY4aBsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
