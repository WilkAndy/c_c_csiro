More than 40% of these are organic and have the potential to be recycled through their agricultural use as soil ameliorants or fertilisers. Organic amendments, such as sludges, manures, and compost are well known to act as organic fertilisers whilst improving the chemical and physical properties of soils. Soil structure decline and the accumulation of phyto-toxic concentrations of aluminium accompanying soil acidification (a naturally occurring process accelerated by agriculture) are among the greatest limitations to agricultural productivity in Australia. Organic amendments offer the potential to arrest or reverse this degradation of the soil resource.Composting or vermicomposting processes can be conducted at minimal cost in any location in Australia, and if the resulting product is of a consistent and high quality it should enable the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:MagRZZew-58C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4499948800054858389&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lRK3hpcHcz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
