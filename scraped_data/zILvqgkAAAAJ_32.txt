Nitrogenous gases can be evolved with NO2\u2010 is added to soil. The aim of the work described here was to determine if gaseous\u2010N losses could occur via chemical transformations of NO2\u2010 during nitrification in soils treated with NH3 fertilizer.Evolution of N2, N2O, and NO + NO2 occurred during nitrification in three soils treated with aqueous NH3. Losses occurred when measured soil pH was > 7.5. The highest gaseous\u2010N loss amounted to 16.5% of applied\u2010N (1156 \u00b5g N applied/g of soil) in a calcareous soil incubated for 28 days at 30\u00b0C. Nitrogen was the major gaseous form of N evolved in all soils. In two soils, NO2\u2010 did not accumulate to more than 13 \u00b5g N/g of soil, but substantial N2 emission was measured.
