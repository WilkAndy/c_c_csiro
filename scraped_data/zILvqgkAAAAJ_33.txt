The UM solves the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a height-varying gravity, avoiding the simplifications used in most GCMs currently applied to exoplanets. In this work we present the coupling of the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation scheme based on the two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with state-of-the-art opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is devoted to the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived synthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both previous models also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and to observations. We find a reasonable agreement between observations and both our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:lei5Nhix5ycC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8522478361426966122", "cites_id": ["8522478361426966122"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/11/aa29183-16/aa29183-16.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:arbOaursRXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 19, "2020": 15, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
