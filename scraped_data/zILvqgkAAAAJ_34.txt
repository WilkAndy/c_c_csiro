No N2O was evolved from the continuously-anaerobic treatment. The continuously-aerobic treatment produced approximately 0.8 \u03bcg N2O-N g\u22121 dry soil in 56 days. Alternate anaerobic-aerobic cycles increased the net N2O evolution with 7.2 \u03bcg N2O-N g\u22121 dry soil produced in 56 days from the 7-day anaerobic, 7-day aerobic treatment. The net N2O evolution increased further when the duration of the anaerobic and aerobic periods was increased from 7-7 days to 14-14 days (15.7\u03bcg N2O-N g\u22121 dry soil in 56 days), although the total 15N loss from the system was approximately the same for the two treatments. The results of this study show that N2O evolution from soils is likely to be greater under fluctuating moisture conditions than under either \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15794310923596180054", "cites_id": ["15794310923596180054"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071783900342", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VqoFaRqqMNsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 4, "1987": 4, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
