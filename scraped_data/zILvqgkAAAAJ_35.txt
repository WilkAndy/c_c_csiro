Various marsh restoration methods were evaluated for mitigating the impact of crude oil on the marsh biota. Oiling the marsh caused no reduction in macrophyte production as compared with the non-oiled plots. Thus the cleanup treatment showed no beneficial effects to S. alterniflora. Likewisw, there was no oil-induced mortality for the marsh macrofauna or meiofauna. In Louisiana Gulf Coast salt marshes, which have a low sensitivity to oil as shown in this study, the best response is no cleanup action at all."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12981477243228059885", "cites_id": ["12981477243228059885"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0143147184900035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7fhsHsZ4J7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
