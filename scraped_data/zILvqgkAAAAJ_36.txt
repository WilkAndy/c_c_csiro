Monthly proton budgets were estimated for the root zone (0\u201390 cm layer) and for the 0\u201325 and 25\u201390 cm layers. After an annual cycle, the root zone was alkalinized by 0.5 to 3.1 kmol OH- ha-1. The alkalinity originated from the mineralization of the organic anions contained in the organic matter. The budget was near neutrality in the 0\u201325 cm layer (range: \u22121.0 to 1.4 kmol H+ ha-1), whereas there was net alkalinization in the 25\u201390 cm layer (1.7 to 2.3 kmol OH- ha-1). In the 0\u201325 cm layer, the acidity produced in autumn by mineralization of organic nitrogen was counterbalanced by the alkalinity released from crop residues. The main acidifying factor in this layer was leaching of NO3 - during early winter (2.4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1639105320380008528", "cites_id": ["1639105320380008528"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00010340", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UAi0wppFvxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 8}}
