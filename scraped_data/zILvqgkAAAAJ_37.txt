The plots were labelled with 15N-enriched fertilizers at the time of sowing of the antecedent crops. The crop of lupins, which derived 79% of its N from symbiotic N2 fixation at physiological maturity, conferred an N benefit to barley of 3.4 g N m-2 when compared to barley following wheat. Lupins used less fertilizer N and less unlabelled soil N compared to the other crops, but the ratios of these sources of N in the plant tops were similar. The apparent sparing of soil+fertilizer N under lupins compared with wheat was 13.6 g N m-2, which was much larger than the measured N benefit. Barley following lupins was less enriched in 15N compared to barley following wheat, and the measured isotope dilution was used to estimate the proportion of barley N derived from biologically fixed N in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3334823377330217024,5701924107611824989", "cites_id": ["3334823377330217024", "5701924107611824989"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00336286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QKBvajGsRy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 10, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
