Condor) grown on a red brown earth in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region. The effect of the inhibitor treatments on biomass and grain yield was determined in 25 m \u00d7 3 m plots, and the effect on recovery, in the plant-soil system, of urea-N applied at sowing was determined in 0.3 m \u00d7 0.3 m microplots using a15N balance technique. The inhibitor limited ammonium oxidation, prevented nitrogen loss by denitrification for 75 days, increased N accumulation by the wheat plants, increased grain N and resulted in a 46% greater recovery of applied nitrogen in the plant-soil system at harvest. However, the inhibitor treatment did not increase grain yield because of waterlogging at the end of tillering and during stem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5135540835711073886", "cites_id": ["5135540835711073886"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01054388", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xj4SSi4bRUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
