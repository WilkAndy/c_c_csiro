Here we report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of the zAB, YAB = 20.2, 20.2 (M1450 = \u221226.5) quasar DES J0454\u22124448 with a redshift of z = 6.09\u00b10.02 based on the onset of the Ly \u03b1 forest and an H i near zone size of 4.1 proper Mpc. The quasar was selected as an i-band drop out with i\u2212z = 2.46 and zAB < 21.5 from an area of \u223c300 deg2. It is the brightest of our 43 candidates and was identified for spectroscopic follow-up solely based on the DES i\u2212z and z\u2212Y colours. The quasar is detected by WISE and has W1AB = 19.68. The discovery of one spectroscopically confirmed quasar with 5.7 < z < 6.5 and zAB \u2264 20.2 is consistent with recent determinations of the luminosity function at z \u223c 6. DES when completed will have imaged \u223c5000 deg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:9v7jY6XdEjAC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5181170847366191082", "cites_id": ["5181170847366191082"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/454/4/3952/992587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6hffRW8350cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 10, "2017": 18, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
