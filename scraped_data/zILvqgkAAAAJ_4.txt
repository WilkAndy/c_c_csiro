At Wodonga, seven tree species were sprinkler irrigated with effluent at an average application rate of 1347 mm per annum from 1980 to 1984. The other site at Canberra was a large grass playing field (9 ha), half of which had been effluent irrigated since 1977. The non-effluent irrigated area served as the control area and provided reference \u2018background\u2019 concentration to assess the extent of contamination due to 17 years of effluent irrigation. Archived soil samples collected before the commencement of effluent irrigation were compared with those taken in 1984 at Wodonga to assess the extent of contamination. The concentration of labile metals was determined by extraction with EDTA because \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 333, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15721151823081750996", "cites_id": ["15721151823081750996"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749196000899", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1MHF8knALNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 9, "2003": 5, "2004": 7, "2005": 19, "2006": 9, "2007": 12, "2008": 16, "2009": 10, "2010": 11, "2011": 11, "2012": 14, "2013": 21, "2014": 23, "2015": 23, "2016": 22, "2017": 18, "2018": 27, "2019": 28, "2020": 19, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
