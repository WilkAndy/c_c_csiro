The concept of potentially mineralisable N (N  0 ) and its determination procedures were re-appraised in this study. Leaching soil before incubation removed considerable amounts of soluble organic N. But the leached soils had higher rates of net N mineralisation than the unleached controls during a subsequent 2-week incubation, suggesting that using the total amount of leached- (organic + inorganic) N for calculating N  0  may not be warranted. N  0  and the mineralisation rate constant k estimated with the conventional model-fitting technique varied significantly with soil, incubation time, temperature and moisture, without consistent trends \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4350755682823824246", "cites_id": ["4350755682823824246"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-003-0604-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:duM5Az79YDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 2, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
