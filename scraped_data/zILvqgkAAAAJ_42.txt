Nitrite can react chemically with soil organic matter and become fixed, and at the same time nitrogenous gases can be evolved. The aim of the work described here was to study mechanisms of gaseous\u2010N formation using 15NO2\u2010 as a tracer, and to define the relationship between fixation and loss of N.Fixation of Na15NO2 in five soils varying in pH and organic C content ranged from 0.6 to 36% of applied NO2\u2010, while the 15N not recovered varied from 6 to 53%. A significant positive correlation was found between 15N fixed and 15N not recovered in the five soils, sampled after 1, 2, and 3 days of incubation.The 15N enrichment of NO + NO2 evolved from three \u03b3\u2010irradiated soils treated with Na15NO2 was only slightly less than the atom % 15N of added NO2\u2010, and the rate of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4471136101213332908", "cites_id": ["4471136101213332908"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400020017x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rOU-T5iqDD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 3, "1983": 4, "1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 7, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 4, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
