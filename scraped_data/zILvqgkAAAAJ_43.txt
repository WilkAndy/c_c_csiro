This study describes the incidence and reasons for cancellation of inpatient surgery in the UK NHS.We conducted a prospective observational cohort study over 7 consecutive days in March 2017 in 245 NHS hospitals. Occurrences and reasons for previous surgical cancellations were recorded. Using multilevel logistic regression, we identified patient- and hospital-level factors associated with cancellation due to inadequate bed capacity.We analysed data from 14 936 patients undergoing planned surgery. A total of 1499 patients (10.0%) reported previous cancellation for the same procedure; contemporaneous hospital census data indicated that 13.9% patients attending inpatient operations were cancelled on the day of surgery. Non-clinical reasons, predominantly inadequate bed capacity, accounted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:jnWRawXoEPoC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12635082446529080341", "cites_id": ["12635082446529080341"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091218305658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FawjpYrUWK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 11, "2020": 21, "2021": 19, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
