Nitrogen is apparently a limiting nutrient since supplemental nitrogen increased above-ground biomass by 40%. (2) There is apparently little loss of internal nitrogen from the system since 80% of the nitrogen added at the rate of 3 g m-2 was recovered in the soil-plant system at the end of the growing season. (3) Nitrogen fixation was the principal source of nitrogen to this vast freshwater system with 6.7 g m-2 year-1 being added. These marshes are apparently serving as large nitrogen sinks, with 12 g m-2 year-1 being retained as organic nitrogen as a result of accretion as determined by 137Cs dating. (4) The results suggest that these freshwater marshes may improve water quality by removing nutrients from inflowing water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7828035510677251392", "cites_id": ["7828035510677251392"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2260361", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QKUPf9LEomwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 4, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 15, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
