Irrigation treatments included a rainfed control (Rf) and irrigation on a weekly interval (Iw) commencing in the spring. Nitrogen was applied at 0 or 150 kg N ha\u22121 at sowing and 15N fertilizer (20\u201322 kg N ha\u22121) was applied at tillering, early-boot and heading. Microplots were sampled at maturity in 1984 and at anthesis and maturity in 1986.Nitrogen applications at sowing had no effect on the 15N recovery in the crop or in the grain. Of the 15N applied in top-dressing, 40\u201350% was recovered by the crop in 1986 and 1984, and similar efficiencies were found at each growth-stage in both years.
