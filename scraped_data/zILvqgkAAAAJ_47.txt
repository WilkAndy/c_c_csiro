Lime, gypsum, and phosphogypsum, or lime in combination with gypsum and phosphogypsum were broadcast at 2500 kg ha-1 on the surface of the soil in May 1990. Pasture production was determined and the soil was sampled to 25 cm depth, 6 and 18 months after treatment application. Surface soil pH was increased to 6-1 by the application of lime, gypsum plus lime and phosphogypsum plus lime treatments in the 0-5 cm depth interval, but remained unchanged when gypsum or phosphogypsum was used alone. Calcium chloride extractable aluminium increased down the soil profile under all treatments to 10-15 cm, but was highest in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7192963298993570791", "cites_id": ["7192963298993570791"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9940995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5wPvrgKK0mMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
