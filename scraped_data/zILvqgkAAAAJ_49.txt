This study was aimed to determine the mortality risk for emergency abdominal paediatric surgery in low-income countries globally.Multicentre, international, prospective, cohort study. Self-selected surgical units performing emergency abdominal surgery submitted prespecified data for consecutive children aged <16\u2005years during a 2-week period between July and December 2014. The United Nation's Human Development Index (HDI) was used to stratify countries. The main outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality, analysed by multilevel logistic regression.This study included 1409 patients from 253 centres in 43 countries; 282 children were under 2\u2005years of age. Among them, 265 (18.8%) were from low-HDI, 450 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:ilT4-yqG5fgC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5540174021854019880", "cites_id": ["5540174021854019880"], "pub_url": "https://gh.bmj.com/content/1/4/e000091.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KMF0duum4kwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 12, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
