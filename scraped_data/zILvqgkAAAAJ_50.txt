Model parameters describing phenology, leaf area development, biomass production and partitioning, demand, uptake and retranslocation of nitrogen, and root growth and water extraction, were assembled from the literature and growth analysis experiments conducted in Australia. The model was tested against independent datasets from Australia (26 to 36 o latitude), which varied in terms of nitrogen supply, water supply, sowing date, and variety. Grain yields, ranging from 30 to 500 gm-2, were simulated with a root man squared deviation of 45 gm-2 (15% of the observed mean). We discuss features of the model that require further development."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=726424035148837105", "cites_id": ["726424035148837105"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/gcirc/2/143.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8TBaq8_GFAoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
