The sample plus KMnO4, H2SO4, and Fe is initially placed in a test tube and heated in a water bath (90\u00b0C). Final digestion with concentrated H2SO4 occurs in a heated Al (to 370\u00b0C) block. The NH4+ content of the cooled tube contents is determined by steam distillation. This method allows simultaneous digestion of 60 samples, is inexpensive, accurate and precise, and includes NO2\u2010 and NO43\u2010 in the total N estimation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:r8lgQMkXaCEC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5004099769499186995", "cites_id": ["5004099769499186995"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400020047x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M_ecPToickUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
