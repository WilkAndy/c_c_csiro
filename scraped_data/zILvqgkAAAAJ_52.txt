Don and Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden were studied in a five-year-old plantation irrigated with salt-enhanced effluent (2.2 dS m\u22121) or freshwater (0.2 dS m\u22121) for 14 weeks during spring and summer. Salt was then rapidly leached by over-irrigation with low-salinity effluent. Soil water and salinity, tree water stress, sap flux, substrate carbon conversion efficiency, foliage and stem growth, and foliar cations and chloride were monitored throughout the study. An average of 9 and 1 Mg ha\u22121 of salt with an average hydraulic load of 660 and 780 mm was applied to the salt and control plots, respectively. Maximum soil salinity in the root zone was 5.8 and 6.8 dS m\u22121 in the eucalypt and pine plots, respectively.Predawn water potential was more than twice as sensitive to increasing salinity in E. grandis as in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17098931640279045658", "cites_id": ["17098931640279045658"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-abstract/18/8-9/565/1632581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GhaFmbubS-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
