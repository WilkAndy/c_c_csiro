We surveyed 6 big piggeries extending from south-eastern Queensland on a self-mulching Vertosol, to an Arenic Rudosol in south-eastern South Australia. We sampled effluent used for irrigation and also soil profiles to permit 'fenceline' comparisons between soils that had and had not been irrigated. The major water-soluble cations sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+) were measured in the effluent and the soil saturation extracts, and also their exchangeable forms on air-dried soil samples. Ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) was also assayed. The effluents were similar, with pH values between 7.5 and 8 together with very high water-soluble NH4-N, lower values for K+ and Na+, and quite low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16887063658548561157", "cites_id": ["16887063658548561157"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR03059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BQUyC-3mWuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 6}}
