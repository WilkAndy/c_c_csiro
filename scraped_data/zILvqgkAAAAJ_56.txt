Plant growth, estimated by CO2 fixation and nitrogen uptake, was not affected by sediment redox potential ranging from oxidized (+500 mV) to strongly reducing (\u2212200 mV). Anaerobic root respiration, evident by alcohol dehydrogenase activity, increased with decreasing sediment redox potential. The results suggest that neither redox potential per se nor anaerobic root respiration can account for the growth differences of S. alterniflora observed in Louisiana's coastal marshes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3381095700406513406", "cites_id": ["3381095700406513406"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304377084900639", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_q5ULqAQ7C4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 4, "1987": 6, "1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 6, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 7, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
