Growth was considered in four phases extending from 95 days after sowing (das 95) to the beginning of rapid stem growth (das 120), the stem growth-phase lasting to the onset of rapid grain-filling (das 148), the grain-filling phase between das 148 and das 170, and the final period to harvest. The first irrigation treatments were applied at das 120.Radiation interception was the major determinant of growth. Rainfed treatments captured ca. 1100 MJ m\u22122 between das 95 and das 148, by which time they had achieved maximum above-ground biomass. Irrigated treatments continued to grow until das 170. They captured ca. 1300 MJ m\u22122 to das 170 where no nitrogen was applied, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9085007892390345838", "cites_id": ["9085007892390345838"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429089900713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bvyLL4tuFH4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
