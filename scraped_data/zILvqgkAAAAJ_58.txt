Marnoo) to two irrigation treatments and six nitrogen fertilizer treatments. Response to nitrogen was greater with than without irrigation. Oil content was increased with irrigation but decreased under increasing nitrogen application, and was inversely related to seed nitrogen concentration. Oil yields averaged 1,168 kg ha\u22121 under irrigated treatments compared with 835 kg ha\u22121 under rainfed treatments. Maximum oil yield (approx. 1,557 kg ha\u22121) was obtained from the irrigated treatment fertilized with 100 kg N ha\u22121 applied at sowing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:3f6DmUdo5nIC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8515519592898688366", "cites_id": ["8515519592898688366"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00292140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bvWa3PMzLXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
