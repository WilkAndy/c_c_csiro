Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020. Patients from all surgical specialties were included. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) within 30\u2009days of surgery. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was defined as peri-operative (7\u2009days before to 30\u2009days after surgery); recent (1-6\u2009weeks before surgery); previous (\u22657\u2009weeks before surgery); or none. Information on prophylaxis regimens or pre-operative anti-coagulation for baseline comorbidities was not available. Postoperative venous thromboembolism rate was 0.5% (666/123,591) in patients without SARS-CoV-2; 2.2% (50/2317) in patients with peri-operative SARS-CoV-2; 1.6% (15/953) in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2; and 1.0% (11/1148) in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with peri-operative (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0)) and recent SARS-CoV-2 (1.9 (95%CI 1.2-3.3)) remained at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, with a borderline finding in previous SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 (95%CI 0.9-3.0)). Overall, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with 30-day \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:FdybmYZWhOwC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8079205511036059402,1133839559245801572", "cites_id": ["8079205511036059402", "1133839559245801572"], "pub_url": "https://boris.unibe.ch/162951/1/Anaesthesia_-_2021_-_-_SARS_u2010CoV_u20102_infection_and_venous_thromboembolism_after_surgery_an_international_prospective_cohort.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cr-uWJsaH3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 38, "2023": 20}}
