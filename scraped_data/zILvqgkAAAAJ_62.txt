Three models of m were identified out of seven evaluated. One model was based on the solution of differential equations, and two on arithmetic mean data of ratios of labeled and total NH+4 pools. Data from well\u2010mixed anaerobic and aerobic soil suspensions amended with rice straw and labeled with (15NH4)2SO4 were used to compare the three models of m and four models of i for 56 d, with measurements every 7 d. Estimated rates of m declined during incubation, particularly during the first 21 d. Correction of m for remineralization of immobilized 15N in the anaerobic system using the total organic N pool (OT) had little effect, but the correction was more pronounced when the estimated active organic N pool (OT*) was used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5304621938924384391", "cites_id": ["5304621938924384391"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800060011x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h_BUYYzNnUkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 6, "1999": 6, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
