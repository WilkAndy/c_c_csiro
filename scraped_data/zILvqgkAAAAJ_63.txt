The oil and the oil plus dispersant were applied to open water adjacent to the marsh and forced onto the marsh, using a pump to create a \u201chead\u201d of water that simulated tidal conditions. Neither crude oil nor oil plus dispersant had any inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the growth of S. alterniflora or the meiofaunal communities, including the meiobenthos."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8358879167414565770", "cites_id": ["8358879167414565770"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5620030411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:insoxlC0AHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
