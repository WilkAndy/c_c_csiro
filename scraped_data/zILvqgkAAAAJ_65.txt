The Atchafalaya delta is a major geological event in the Holocene history of the Mississippi River delta system because it represents the initial stages of a new delta cycle. The delta has resulted from the capture of the Mississippi River flow by the hydraulically more efficient Atchafalaya River. Using 137Cs and 210Pb dating techniques, maximum sedimentation of delta-flanking environments was found to occur in the bay bottoms and marshes closest to the emerging delta. Marshes directly under the influence of the emerging delta were accreting at rates as great as 1\u00b74 cm y\u22121 with appreciable mineral sediment inputs. In addition to increasing shoreline progradation, the added sediment is providing nutrients for increased net plant productivity which provides the organic source needed for vertical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15767894463967148884", "cites_id": ["15767894463967148884"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272771487900321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VDucHHnQ0toJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 3, "1990": 5, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
