Knowledge of nitrogen transformations and balances is essential to design and operate plantations so as to keep groundwater degradation within acceptable limits. APSIM for Effluent, a model of water, salt, and nitrogen in effluent-irrigated plantations was tested against data from a plantation of Eucalyptus grandis (flooded gum) irrigated with either secondary-treated sewage effluent or bore water. APSIM was then used for quantifying nitrogen transformations, leaching, and balance, within the plantation. Summed over 5 years, the predicted nitrogen balance of the effluent-irrigated treatment showed that the accumulation of nitrogen in the aboveground biomass and litter (335 and 19 kg/ha) was significantly less than the amount of nitrogen added in effluent (508 kg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=90632759388723611", "cites_id": ["90632759388723611"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/S98093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m9lgtAP-QQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 8, "2006": 2, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
