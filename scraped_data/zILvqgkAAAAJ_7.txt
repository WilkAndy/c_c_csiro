It is speculated that sulfide may limit growth by preventing nitrogen uptake and root development. Total sulfide concentrations as high as 250 \u00b5g g\u22121 of sediment and free sulfide concentrations in the order of 150 \u00b5g g\u22121 were found in the inland sediment. The inland sediment contained higher NH+4\u2010N concentrations at depth than the streamside sediment. The higher NH+4\u2010N concentrations closely paralleled the increasing sulfide concentrations and was inversely related to rooting depth. Maximum NH+4\u2010N concentrations of 60 and 16 \u00b5g N g\u22121 of dry soil was observed in the inland and streamside sediment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=975928586363436412", "cites_id": ["975928586363436412"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1983.03615995004700050018x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fH1X7OAxiw0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 2, "1986": 4, "1987": 4, "1988": 8, "1989": 13, "1990": 11, "1991": 13, "1992": 4, "1993": 7, "1994": 6, "1995": 8, "1996": 5, "1997": 6, "1998": 8, "1999": 7, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 8, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 12, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
