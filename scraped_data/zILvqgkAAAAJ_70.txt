Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID\u201019 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30\u2010day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and a comparison with prepandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data.From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. Thirty\u2010day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was 3.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:EuNJgPmvzmUC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2673707261260698296", "cites_id": ["2673707261260698296"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/codi.15431", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uJLTlJbqGiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 15, "2022": 33, "2023": 4}}
