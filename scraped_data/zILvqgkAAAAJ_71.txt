Organic N forms included crop residues, green manures, composts, animal manures and slurries in either crop sequences or successive cuttings of pasture grasses. As stated in the pioneering paper of Low and Piper (1957), the use of 15N-labelled materials is essential to follow the dynamics of fertiliser N in the soil-plant system. The majority of studies used 15N-labelled manufactured fertilisers.In general there was no difference of N fertiliser form on the 15N recovery in the 1st residual crop (R1) and in subsequent crops (R2, R3, Rn\u2026). The 15N recovery was <10% of added N in the R1 crop and less in subsequent crops (R2, R3), with the exception of studies where severe water stress limited crop growth in the year of N application (Yr0).
