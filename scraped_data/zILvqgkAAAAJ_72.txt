Rate of vertical marsh accretion determined from137Cs dating was compared to water level changes or submergence. Results identified marsh locations that are not keeping pace with submergence. Coastwide vertical accretion rates on the order of 0.7\u20130.8 cm/yr are not sufficient to keep pace with water level increases occurring at rates in most locations of over 1.0 cm/yr. Submergence rates were four to five times greater than eustatic sea level change for the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana gulf coast marshes are likely to continue deteriorating unless means are implemented for distributing Mississippi River sediment to the marsh. It is estimated that sediment equivalent to less than 10 percent of the present annual suspended load of the Mississippi would \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3994312821657656627", "cites_id": ["3994312821657656627"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01736110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M12xOFmmbjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
