The   cases presented are the Held\u2013Suarez test, a simplified model of   Earth (including a stratosphere), and a hypothetical tidally locked   Earth. Furthermore, we show that using simplifications to the   dynamical equations, which are expected to be justified for the   physical domains and flow regimes we have studied, and which are   supported by the ENDGame dynamical core, also produces matching   long-term, large-scale flows. Finally, we present evidence for   differences in the detail of the planetary flows and circulations   resulting from improvements in the ENDGame formulation over New   Dynamics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:HVjPwkwF6E4C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9529106061400546740", "cites_id": ["9529106061400546740"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/3059/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tB3NuHkvPoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
