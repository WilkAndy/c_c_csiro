We compute the model line intensities both assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and, relaxing this condition (non-LTE), through detailed balance calculations, in order to compare with the observations. Taking the model parameters derived, we calculate the changes in heating rate required to account for the modelled temperature profiles that are consistent with the measured line intensities. We compute the electron precipitation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:wjOVU9QWB94C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6695227442898648999", "cites_id": ["6695227442898648999"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505004483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p79r8OI56lwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
