A native grass, Poa sieberiana, and opportunistic non-fixing species were used as reference plants. The natural 15N abundance, method was considered to provide accurate estimates of N2 fixation because of uniformity in natural 15N enrichment and high \u03b415N values in soil and reference plants. Estimates of N2 abundance method. Estimates of N2 fixed by A. melanoxylon and A. mucronata increased from 2.0 and 1.4 mg per plant after 1 year to 26 mg per plant and 57 mg per plant after 27 months, respectively. Accretion of N to the forest ecosystem from N2 fixation by these Acacia species was low (5 and 116 g ha\u22121 after 27 months) due to low plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2454940612085485097", "cites_id": ["2454940612085485097"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112793901198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KQ4J2HqzESIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
