Matong) grown on a heavy clay in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region following foliar applications of urea at heading were investigated. Ammonia (NH3) volatilization was determined by a micrometeorological method and total nitrogen (N) loss was determined by a15N balance technique. The effects of the foliar application on grain N concentration and grain yield were determined also.Little nitrogen was lost by NH3 volatilization following the foliar application. The rate of NH3 loss increased briefly from <11 g N ha\u22121 hr\u22121 to >19 g N ha\u22121 hr\u22121 following rainfalls of 3 and 2 mm which washed 34% of the applied N from the plant onto the soil and increased the pH of the surface soil. The pH effect was short lived and total NH3 loss amounted to only 2.13 kg N ha\u22121 or 4.3% of the applied N.The15N balance study also showed that little N was lost from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6667857509604747290", "cites_id": ["6667857509604747290"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01049743", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GmjpwBP9iFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
