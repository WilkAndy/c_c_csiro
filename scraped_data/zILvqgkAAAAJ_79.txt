This interplanetary space is permeated by stellar radiation and winds generated by the star (or stars) around which the planets orbit; stellar winds are ionized plasma\u2014mainly protons and electrons\u2014which may contain magnetic fields imposed by the star (s) that generated them. Thus, the upper atmosphere of a planet is sensitive to radiation and particle inputs from its central star (s); it acts as an indicator of what has been called the \u2018space weather\u2019in its neighbourhood. In the case of unmagnetized planets, such as Venus and Mars in our Solar System, the interaction with the stellar wind is direct. But in the case of magnetized planets, such as Earth and all of the Solar System\u2019s giant planets, this interaction is mediated by the magnetosphere, the region of space that is controlled by the planetary magnetic field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:lWZ-Rgc0HLgC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14592476169469279950", "cites_id": ["14592476169469279950"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=62bb38b6f0be6208ed733de43e1a601f4d3a5477", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zr6RCsPjgsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
