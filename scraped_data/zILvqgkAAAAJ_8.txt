It was generally assumed that the important pathways of loss were volatilization of NH3, and reduction of nitrate to N2O and N2 by soil microorganisms (biological denitrification). There was little direct evidence to support the assumption of significant losses via these pathways, despite intensive study of the factors affecting the processes. However, recent advances in the methodology for the collection of samples and measurement of gaseous forms of N, have stimulated research on gaseous-N losses from soil. Investigations have shown that several gaseous forms of N may be evolved from soils which are actively nitrifying. The nature of the processes which cause these losses is currently the subject of much investigation and speculation.
