Wheat was grown in 1993, and the site was sown to lucerne in 1994, a drought year. The paddock was re-sown to lucerne on 3 June 1995. In 1993, the soil water content in the 0\u00b725-0 \u00b790 m layer had been maintained near its drained limit from previous harvest until the autumn break. With these initial conditions, current season rainfall displaced the resident soil water. Drainage measured at 0\u00b725 m was 120 mm and produced 97 mm of drainage at 0\u00b79 m. In contrast, the soil water storage in the 0\u00b725-0\u00b7 90 m layer at the autumn break in 1995 was about 70 mm below the drained limit because of the drought in the preceding year. Under these conditions, drainage response differed from 1993 in that 112 mm of drainage at 0\u00b790 m was generated by a much higher drainage of 178 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17784025320435833711", "cites_id": ["17784025320435833711"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/a97076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b1shHc6MzfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
