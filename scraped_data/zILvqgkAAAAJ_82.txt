Air samples were collected in syringes and the CO2 concentration determined on a gas chromatograph equipped with a catalytic conversion unit to quantitatively reduce CO2 to CH4, and a flame ionisation detector. The system provides an appraisal of stress by measuring the relative decrease in gross photosynthesis. The described technique is portable, rapid and can be used in remote areas. It was developed to determine the effect of oil spills on a saltmarsh, but can be used to determine the effects of other man-induced\u2014as well as natural\u2014stresses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7271444859700556949", "cites_id": ["7271444859700556949"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0143147181900519", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lbRK-pJc6WQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 4}}
