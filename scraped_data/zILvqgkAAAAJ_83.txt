The soil was a Red Kandosol located in southern New South Wales. Mineralisation was estimated usingin situ incubations inside capped PVC tubes, which were sampled every 3 weeks. Soil from the tubes was sampled at depth intervals of 2 cm to a depth of 10 cm and at 5-cm intervals from 10 to 20 cm. The results showed that net N mineralisation decreased with depth to 20 cm. Over the season, an average of 32% of the N mineralised in the top 20 cm of soil originated from the 0\u20132 cm layer, 72% was from the 0\u20136 cm layer, and only 13% was from soil below 10 cm. The decrease in N mineralisation with soil depth was highly correlated with decreases in the organic carbon (r2 = 0.84, P < 0.05) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17994671318612395595", "cites_id": ["17994671318612395595"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR99058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S0bNcznqufkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
