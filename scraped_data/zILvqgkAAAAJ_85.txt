Matong) at heading on the concentrations of nutrients in the plant, on grain and flour composition and milling and baking quality were studied. The crop was grown on a red- brown earth in the Goulburn Valley irrigation area of northern Victoria. There were 2 application rates of urea, 0 and 50 kg N/ha combined factorially with 2 application rates of calcium sulfate, 0 and 20 kg S/ha.Additions of N increased the concentrations of both N and S in the grain and increased protein level, but grain N:S ratio remained unaffected. Sulfur application had no effect on grain composition or on flour or dough properties. A standard range of baking tests showed that the extra protein synthesised was functional protein contributing to the dough properties in an additive manner. The N treatment lowered the hot paste viscosity and the brightness of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13089039883935887740", "cites_id": ["13089039883935887740"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA9900095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fDHr_GycpbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
