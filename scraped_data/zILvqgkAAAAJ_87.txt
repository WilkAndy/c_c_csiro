Treatments included rainfed and irrigated crops (treatments RF and I, resp.). Nitrogen treatments were nil (N0) and 150 kg N ha\u22121 (N150) applied at sowing.Yield ranged from ca. 200 g m\u22122 to 700 g m\u22122, and in many cases approximated that predicted by a water-limited productivity function (WLPF) describing the maximum yield attainable depending on seasonal rainfall. Such cases included rainfed crops which received N at sowing (treatment RFN150). Otherwise, yield was less than predicted by the WLPF, and was clearly limited by factors other than water when seasonal water supply, including irrigation, exceeded ca. 500 mm.Nitrogen uptake (NU) ranged from 4 g N m\u22122 to ca. 20 g N m\u22122. The N uptake of treatment RFN150 was ca. 12\u201315 g N m\u22122 each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17630773154383791982", "cites_id": ["17630773154383791982"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037842909290071G", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bgeKpsUWrfQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
