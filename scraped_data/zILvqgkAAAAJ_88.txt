Since some studies have shown that irrigation with waste water can lead to contamination of groundwater resources, there is need for a model to predict the fate of irrigated water, salt, and nitrogen that can be applied to a variety of different soils, climates, and crops. We present the development of the water balance part of such a model, APSIM for Effluent, and carry out a comparison against data obtained from an effluent-irrigated plantation of Eucalyptus grandis. Over 10 months, modelled tree water use was within 1.5% of that obtained by sap-flux measurements. When compared over 5 years of the experiment, modelled drainage lay above that estimated by a water balance technique, which was known a priori to underestimate drainage, and was close to that estimated by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12991967827989591433", "cites_id": ["12991967827989591433"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377498000869", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iXWfuOe9TLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
