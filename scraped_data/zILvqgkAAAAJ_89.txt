The potential of these compounds to decrease the aluminium concentration in the soil solution and remove exchangeable aluminium, and their effects on soil acidity are described.The calcium citrate solution increased the soil solution pH from 5 to a maximum value of 7 in the upper portion of the column. In contrast, the fulvate, calcium chloride and phosphogypsum solutions had little effect on soil\u2010solution pH. Treatment with calcium citrate, or fulvate solution that contained 51 mm Na, removed most of the exchangeable aluminium from the column. The cation exchange sites in the upper portion of the column were saturated with calcium, and the cation exchange capacity of the soil was increased from 35 to c. 80 mmolc kg\u22121 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2660368747338489443", "cites_id": ["2660368747338489443"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.1995.tb01812.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y16pzEeH6yQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
