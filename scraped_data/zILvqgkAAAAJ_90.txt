By the end of 2015, in coordination with the Regional Seas Conventions, each EU Member State was required to develop a marine strategy for their waters, together with other countries within the same marine region or sub-region. Coherent monitoring programs, submitted in 2014, form a key component of this strategy, which then aimed to lead to a Program of Measures (submitted in 2015). The European DEVOTES FP7 project has produced and interrogated a catalog of EU marine monitoring related to MSFD descriptors 1 (biological diversity), 2 [non-indigenous species (NIS)], 4 (food webs), and 6 (seafloor integrity). Here we detail the monitoring activity at the regional and sub-regional level for these descriptors, as well as for 11 biodiversity components, 22 habitats and the 37 anthropogenic pressures addressed. The metadata collated for existing European monitoring networks were subject to a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. This interrogation has indicated case studies to address the following questions: (a) what are the types of monitoring currently in place? (b) who does what and how? (c) is the monitoring fit-for-purpose for addressing the MSFD requirements? and (d) what are the impediments to better monitoring (e.g., costs, shared responsibilities between countries, overlaps, co-ordination, etc.)? We recommend the future means to overcome the identified impediments and develop more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:q22ZieUsQXoC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5906514317556134835", "cites_id": ["5906514317556134835"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00161/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:szOxTnon-FEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 12, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 6}}
