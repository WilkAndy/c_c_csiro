Studies were conducted in the laboratory and field. Maximum gaseous N accumulation, from fresh\u2010water and saline sediment amended with 4.5 \u00b5g nitrate\u2010N (NO4\u2212\u2010N) g\u22121 (on dry\u2010wt basis), was 1.6 and 1.4 \u00b5g N g\u22121, respectively. The addition of 50 \u00b5g NH4+\u2010N g\u22121 stimulated the evolution of N2O from both sediments, and represents 0.02 and 0.2% of the NH4+\u2010N applied to the saline and fresh sediment, respectively. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions measured in the field were low. The annual N2O emission was 10 and 34 mg N m\u22122 from the saline and freshwater lakes. These values agree closely with the N2O emission rates calculated from laboratory data.Denitrification was also estimated from NH4+\u2010N amended \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7185331299312205282", "cites_id": ["7185331299312205282"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1983.00472425001200040015x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4v3_SL9st2MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 3, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 5, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3}}
