However, when irrigated at the water-use rate of the plantation, nitrogen (N) applied in the effluent often exceeds the demand of the trees both in the early stages of growth and after canopy closure when much of the N is supplied from the decomposition of litter. With the ample supply of water and large loadings of N, conditions are conducive to significant N losses. The principal potential N loss mechanisms are leaching of nitrate-N to groundwater and biological denitrification. In 4 separate experiments between winter 1992 and summer 1994, 15N-labelled N (total application of 2 g N/m2; 30 atom%) was applied to 1-m2 subplots or small plastic (PVC) cylinders. In the first 2 experiments, using 1-m2 subplots, the conservative tracer Br was applied as KBr with the 15N at a total application \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=391057025559736145", "cites_id": ["391057025559736145"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/S98073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ua9o90pQbQUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
