Labelled NH 4+\ue5f8 N equivalent to 100 \u03bcg 15 N g\u2212 1 of dry soil was added in four instalments over an eight week period. Recovery of the added nitrogen ranged from 93% 5 months after addition of the NH 4+\ue5f8 N to 52% at the end of the third growing season which represented a nitrogen loss equivalent to 3\u00b7 4 gNm\u2212 2. The availability of the labelled NH 4+\ue5f8 N incorporated into the organic fraction was estimated by calculation of the rate of mineralization. The time required for mineralization of 1% of the tagged organic N increases progressively with succeeding cuttings of the S. alterniflora and ranged from 152 to 299 days. Only 2% of the nitrogen applied as 15 N labelled plant material to the marsh surface in the fall could be accounted for in S. alterniflora the following season."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14300010828922266604", "cites_id": ["14300010828922266604"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272771483900586", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7KMmjhXYc8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3}}
