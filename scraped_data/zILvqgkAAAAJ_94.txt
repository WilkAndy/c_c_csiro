Reduced S species accumulated under anaerobic conditions, but oxidized rapidly when the systems were aerated. The SO4 concentration in solution increased as the Eh of the soil suspensions increased and pH decreased to <4. The extreme acidity developed in all soils resulted in the dissolution of Al, Mn, Mg, and Si."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11244137595054016215", "cites_id": ["11244137595054016215"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100030014x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:10bPlpEzC5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
