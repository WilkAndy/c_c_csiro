Peat is formed due to vertical accretion as the marsh surface is maintained relative to a mean water level. The rate of accretion determined from Cs-137 dating averaged 0.85 cm and 0.95 cm/yr for the fresh and brackish peat deposits respectively. However, increase in water level, obtained from analysis of tide gauge data, was estimated to be in order of 60-1.0 cm/yr. The rapid rate of peat accumulation (254-296 g C/sq m/yr) is attributed to increases in water level due to subsidence resulting from the consolidation of Mississippi River deltaic deposits. 28 references, 5 figures, 1 table."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13724688039822845500", "cites_id": ["13724688039822845500"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5230563", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PGaxQg7jd74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
