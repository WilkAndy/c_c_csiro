Nitrate formed in the aerobic zone of the soil is readily reduced in the deeper anoxic zone by dissimilatory and/or assimilatory processes. The experiments were conducted in soil cores 15 cm in diameter by 12 to 15 cm in depth. 15N\u2010labelled NO\u20103 at 0.6 g N m\u22122 was administered in either a single injection into the floodwater or in repeated small injections below the sediment\u2010water interface. For the single application experiment, 14% of the 15N remained in the system; 4% NH+4\u2010N and 10% organic N. This implies dissimilatory reduction, with NO\u20103 being reduced to NH+4 prior to formation of organic N. Fifty separate applications increased the recovery of 15N in the NH+4\u2010N and organic N pool to 52%. The latter procedure more nearly reproduces the low steady\u2010state concentration of NO\u20103 observed in salt \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10643659930057275989", "cites_id": ["10643659930057275989"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1982.03615995004600040016x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VXofWVDgtZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4}}
