Ammonia volatilisation was measured by the micrometeorological mass balance technique using 2 different passive samplers, and by an indirect technique based on the measurements of ammoniacal-N (NH4+ + NH3) concentration, pH, and temperature of the soil solution in the 0\u20133 mm soil layer, and wind speed at 1.2 m above the soil surface. Maximal NH3 emission rates were measured directly following the effluent-irrigation. There was reasonable agreement between the 2 different passive gas samplers used to measure NH3 volatilisation. The NH3 volatilised was well related to the product of wind speed and the equilibrium ammonia concentration (calculated from the soil solution measurements) as was found in other studies. In addition, NH3 flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14292813768884697530", "cites_id": ["14292813768884697530"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr9960789", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ujkvb2VGWsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
