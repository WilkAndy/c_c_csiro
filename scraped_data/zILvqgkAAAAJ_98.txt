Matong) at heading. The urea (50 kg N ha-1) was broadcast onto the soil surface and washed into the soil with 22 mm of water applied by sprinkler irrigation. Ammonia (NH3) volatilization was determined by a micro-meteorological method and total nitrogen (N) loss was measured by the 15N balance technique. The effect of the fertilizer application on grain yield and protein content was also assessed.With this method of application the pH of the surface soil remained below 7.2 for the period of the study. The low pH, together with the dense wheat canopy, ensured that no NH3 was volatilized after urea addition.The 15N balance study showed that no N was lost from the plant-soil system between the time of the urea application (127 days after sowing; DAS 127) and the first flood irrigation 5 days later \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "zILvqgkAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7185153001974111712", "cites_id": ["7185153001974111712"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar9890951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4J1_M5bKtmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 6, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
